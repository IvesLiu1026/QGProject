**Transcript**:
In the early 1960s, Dick Fosbury tried his hand at almost every sport, but never excelled at anything, until, at the age of 16, he turned to the high jump. But when he couldn't compete against the strong athletes at his college using the standard high jump techniques of the time, Fosbury tried to jump a different way: backwards. Instead of jumping with his face towards the bar, bringing each leg over in the traditional straddle method, he jumped with his back towards the bar. Fosbury improved his record by over half a foot, and left his coaches amazed by this strange new style of high jumping. During the next few years, Fosbury perfected his high jump style, won the U.S. National trials, and assured his place in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico. In the Olympic Games, Fosbury amazed the world with his new technique, winning a gold metal with an Olympic record leap of 2.24 meters. By the next Olympic Games, almost all of the competing of high jumpers had adopted what came to be known as the Fosbury Flop. What's the secret behind the technique? It lies in a physics concept called the center of mass. For every object, we can locate the average position of all of its mass by taking into account how the mass is spread around the object. For instance, the center of mass of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density will be in the intersection of both diagonals, in equal distance from each corner. We can find the center of mass for other objects by similar calculations, or by finding the object's balancing point, which lies right underneath its center of mass. Try balancing a broom by holding it and slowly bringing your hands together until they meet. This balancing point lies right underneath the broom's center of mass. We humans also have a center of mass. When most people stand up, their center of mass is around the belly, but what happens to your center of mass when you lift your hands in the air? Your center of mass moves upwards. It moves all the time as you move through the day, based on how your body is positioned. It can even move outside of your body. When you bend forward, your center of mass is located below your bent belly in a place where there is no mass at all. Weird to think about, but that's the average position of all your mass. Many objects' center of mass are outside their bodies. Think of doughnuts or boomerangs. Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position of the center of mass of the jumper. The jumper runs very fast, so he can divert his horizontal velocity to vertical velocity, and jumps. Wait for it...there. Look at the jumper's center of mass as his body bends backward. It's below the bar. That is the secret behind the jump. With the old, pre-Fosbury techniques, the jumper had to apply enough force to lift his center of mass above the bar by a few inches in order to clear it. The Fosbury Flopper doesn't have to do that. The genius of the Fosbury Flop is that the jumper can apply the same amount of force, but raise his body much higher than before. That means he can raise the bar so high that even when his center of mass can't go any higher, his arching body can. Fosbury's technique brought the high jump to new heights by splitting the jumper's body away from his center of mass, giving it that much more room to clear higher and higher bars. So the Fosbury Flop may be sports history's only great leap forward, that is also a great leap backward.

**Transcript**:
In the early 1960s, Dick Fosbury tried his hand at almost every sport, but never excelled at anything, until, at the age of 16, he turned to the high jump. But when he couldn't compete against the strong athletes at his college using the standard high jump techniques of the time, Fosbury tried to jump a different way: backwards. Instead of jumping with his face towards the bar, bringing each leg over in the traditional straddle method, he jumped with his back towards the bar. Fosbury improved his record by over half a foot, and left his coaches amazed by this strange new style of high jumping. During the next few years, Fosbury perfected his high jump style, won the U.S. National trials, and assured his place in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico. In the Olympic Games, Fosbury amazed the world with his new technique, winning a gold metal with an Olympic record leap of 2.24 meters. By the next Olympic Games, almost all of the competing of high jumpers had adopted what came to be known as the Fosbury Flop. What's the secret behind the technique? It lies in a physics concept called the center of mass. For every object, we can locate the average position of all of its mass by taking into account how the mass is spread around the object. For instance, the center of mass of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density will be in the intersection of both diagonals, in equal distance from each corner. We can find the center of mass for other objects by similar calculations, or by finding the object's balancing point, which lies right underneath its center of mass. Try balancing a broom by holding it and slowly bringing your hands together until they meet. This balancing point lies right underneath the broom's center of mass. We humans also have a center of mass. When most people stand up, their center of mass is around the belly, but what happens to your center of mass when you lift your hands in the air? Your center of mass moves upwards. It moves all the time as you move through the day, based on how your body is positioned. It can even move outside of your body. When you bend forward, your center of mass is located below your bent belly in a place where there is no mass at all. Weird to think about, but that's the average position of all your mass. Many objects' center of mass are outside their bodies. Think of doughnuts or boomerangs. Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position of the center of mass of the jumper. The jumper runs very fast, so he can divert his horizontal velocity to vertical velocity, and jumps. Wait for it...there. Look at the jumper's center of mass as his body bends backward. It's below the bar. That is the secret behind the jump. With the old, pre-Fosbury techniques, the jumper had to apply enough force to lift his center of mass above the bar by a few inches in order to clear it. The Fosbury Flopper doesn't have to do that. The genius of the Fosbury Flop is that the jumper can apply the same amount of force, but raise his body much higher than before. That means he can raise the bar so high that even when his center of mass can't go any higher, his arching body can. Fosbury's technique brought the high jump to new heights by splitting the jumper's body away from his center of mass, giving it that much more room to clear higher and higher bars. So the Fosbury Flop may be sports history's only great leap forward, that is also a great leap backward.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 is not an exact match to the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about locating the center of mass of an object, and Question 4 asks about the balancing point of a broom, which is related to the center of mass. The correct option for Question 4, "Right underneath the broom's center of mass," is also related to the concept of locating the center of mass.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, which asks about locating the center of mass by calculating the average position of all the mass of the object or finding the balancing point. If a new generated MCQ were created that more closely matched the ground truth MCQ, it would be a better match. 

But among the given options, Question 4 is the most similar.

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so it's 1995 I'm in college and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence Rhode Island to Portland Oregon you know we're young and unemployed so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests basically the longest route we can possibly take and somewhere in the middle of South Dakota I turned to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles what's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road my friend looks at me totally blankly this actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look and I'm like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them she just stares at me for a few moments and then she cracks up because she figures out what I'm talking about and what I'm talking about is this right the famous Chinese character for picnic area I have spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature in other words as you heard Chris say I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong this might strike you as a strange career move but it actually is one great Advantage no job competition in fact most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong you know and we get it in the abstract we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes the human species and general is fallible okay fine but when it comes down to me right now to all the beliefs I hold here in the present tense suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about and the thing is you know the present tense is where we live we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense so effectively we all wind up kind of traveling through life sort of Trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything I think this is a problem I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives and I think it's a problem for for all of us collectively as a culture so what I want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right and second why it's such a problem and finally I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right one reason actually has to do with the feeling of being wrong so let me ask you guys something or actually let me ask you guys something because you're right here how does it feel emotionally how does it feel to be wrong Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing embarrassing okay wonderful great Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing thank you these are great answers but there answers to a different question you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you're wrong realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things right I mean it can be devastating it can be revelatory can actually be quite funny like my stupid Chinese character mistake but just being wrong doesn't feel like anything I'll give you an analogy you remember that Looney Tunes cartoon where there's this kind of pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a Road Runner in pretty much every episode of this cartoon there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the Road Runner and the Road Runner runs off a cliff which is fine he's a bird he can fly but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him and what's funny at least if you're you know six years old is that the coyote is totally fine too he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in midair that's when he falls when we're wrong about something not when we realize it but before that we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down you know we're already wrong we're already in trouble but we feel like we're on Solid ground so I should actually correct something I said a moment ago it does feel like something to be wrong it feels like being right so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness I call this error blindness you know most of the time we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something until it's too late but there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural think back for a moment to elementary school you're sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers and one of them looks like this this is not mine by the way so there you are in grade school and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper that's the dumb kid the Troublemaker the one who never does his homework so by the time you are 9 years years old you've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits and second of all that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes we learn these really bad lessons really well and a lot of us and I suspect especially a lot of us in this room deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists overachievers right Mr CFO astrophysicist Ultram marathoner you're all CFO astrophysicist ultramarathon as it turns out okay so so fine right except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong because according to this getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us so we just insist that we're right because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe so let me tell you a story a couple of years ago a woman comes into Beth Israel deonis Medical Center for a surgery Beth Israel is in Boston it's the teaching hospital for Harvard one of the best hospitals in the country so this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room she's anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room everything seems to have gone fine and she wakes up and she looks down at herself and she says why is the wrong side of my body in bandages well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one when the vice president for healthcare quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting he said for whatever reason the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong well you know that's when we wind up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico or torpedoing the global economy so this is a huge practical problem but it's also a huge social problem think for a moment about what it means to feel right it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality and when you feel that way you've got a problem to solve which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you it turns out most of us explain those people the same way by resorting to A Series of Unfortunate assumptions the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant you know you know they don't they don't have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them they're going to see the light and come on over to our team when that doesn't work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption which is that they're idiots they have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together correctly and when that doesn't work when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart then we move on to a third assumption they know the truth and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes so this is a catastrophe this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly but you know to me what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of Being Human you know it's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just kind of gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring the Miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is it's that you can see the world as it isn't we can remember the past and we can think about the future and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place and we all do this a little differently which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this and yeah you know it is also why we get things wrong 12200 years before dayart said his famous thing about I think therefore I am this guy St Augustine sat down and wrote fer ergosum I air therefore I am Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it's not some kind of you know embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome it's totally fundamental to who we are because unlike God we don't really know what's going on out there and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity you know last year for various reasons I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show This American Life I'm sure a lot of you know it and so I'm listening and I'm listening and at some point I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong and my first thought was I've lost it you know I've become the crazy wrongness lady I just imagine it everywhere which has happened but but a couple of months later I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass who's the host of the show and I mentioned this to him and he was like no you know actually that's true in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme and the crypto theme is I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead and the thing is says irog glass we need this we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work and for the rest of us as audience members as listeners as readers we eat this stuff up you know we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings when it comes to our stories we love being wrong but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction Liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East and something else happened instead and hosy Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the Reigns of power onto his son and something else happened instead and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together and something else happened instead and I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize and something else happened instead I mean this is life you know for good and for ill we generate these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns around and astonishes us I mean no offense but this entire conference isn't unbelievable Monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong we just spent an entire week talking about Innovations and advancements and improvements but you know why we need all of those Innovations and advancements and improvements because half the stuff that seem most mindboggling and World altering it you know Ted 1998 didn't really work out that way did it like where's my Jetpack Chris so here we are again and that's how it goes we come up with another idea we tell another story we hold another conference the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of Wonder and to me if you really want to ReDiscover wonder you need to step outside of that tiny terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say wow I don't know maybe I'm wrong thank you thank you guys

but a couple of months later I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass who's the host of the show and I mentioned this to him and he was like no you know actually that's true in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme and the crypto theme is I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead and the thing is says irog glass we need this we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work and for the rest of us as audience members as listeners as readers we eat this stuff up you know we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings when it comes to our stories we love being wrong but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction Liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East and something else happened instead and hosy Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the Reigns of power onto his son and something else happened instead and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together and something else happened instead and I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize and something else happened instead I mean this is life you know for good and for ill we generate these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns around and astonishes us I mean no offense but this entire conference isn't unbelievable Monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong we just spent an entire week talking about Innovations and advancements and improvements but you know why we need all of those Innovations and advancements and improvements because half the stuff that seem most mindboggling and World altering it you know Ted 1998 didn't really work out that way did it like where's my Jetpack Chris so here we are again and that's how it goes we come up with another idea we tell another story we hold another conference the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of Wonder and to me if you really want to ReDiscover wonder you need to step outside of that tiny terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say wow I don't know maybe I'm wrong thank you thank you guys

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so it's 1995 I'm in college and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence Rhode Island to Portland Oregon you know we're young and unemployed so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests basically the longest route we can possibly take and somewhere in the middle of South Dakota I turned to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles what's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road my friend looks at me totally blankly this actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look and I'm like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them she just stares at me for a few moments and then she cracks up because she figures out what I'm talking about and what I'm talking about is this right the famous Chinese character for picnic area I have spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature in other words as you heard Chris say I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong this might strike you as a strange career move but it actually is one great Advantage no job competition in fact most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong you know and we get it in the abstract we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes the human species and general is fallible okay fine but when it comes down to me right now to all the beliefs I hold here in the present tense suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about and the thing is you know the present tense is where we live we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense so effectively we all wind up kind of traveling through life sort of Trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything I think this is a problem I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives and I think it's a problem for for all of us collectively as a culture so what I want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right and second why it's such a problem and finally I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right one reason actually has to do with the feeling of being wrong so let me ask you guys something or actually let me ask you guys something because you're right here how does it feel emotionally how does it feel to be wrong Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing embarrassing okay wonderful great Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing thank you these are great answers but there answers to a different question you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you're wrong realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things right I mean it can be devastating it can be revelatory can actually be quite funny like my stupid Chinese character mistake but just being wrong doesn't feel like anything I'll give you an analogy you remember that Looney Tunes cartoon where there's this kind of pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a Road Runner in pretty much every episode of this cartoon there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the Road Runner and the Road Runner runs off a cliff which is fine he's a bird he can fly but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him and what's funny at least if you're you know six years old is that the coyote is totally fine too he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in midair that's when he falls when we're wrong about something not when we realize it but before that we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down you know we're already wrong we're already in trouble but we feel like we're on Solid ground so I should actually correct something I said a moment ago it does feel like something to be wrong it feels like being right so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness I call this error blindness you know most of the time we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something until it's too late but there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural think back for a moment to elementary school you're sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers and one of them looks like this this is not mine by the way so there you are in grade school and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper that's the dumb kid the Troublemaker the one who never does his homework so by the time you are 9 years years old you've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits and second of all that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes we learn these really bad lessons really well and a lot of us and I suspect especially a lot of us in this room deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists overachievers right Mr CFO astrophysicist Ultram marathoner you're all CFO astrophysicist ultramarathon as it turns out okay so so fine right except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong because according to this getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us so we just insist that we're right because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe so let me tell you a story a couple of years ago a woman comes into Beth Israel deonis Medical Center for a surgery Beth Israel is in Boston it's the teaching hospital for Harvard one of the best hospitals in the country so this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room she's anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room everything seems to have gone fine and she wakes up and she looks down at herself and she says why is the wrong side of my body in bandages well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one when the vice president for healthcare quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting he said for whatever reason the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong well you know that's when we wind up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico or torpedoing the global economy so this is a huge practical problem but it's also a huge social problem think for a moment about what it means to feel right it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality and when you feel that way you've got a problem to solve which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you it turns out most of us explain those people the same way by resorting to A Series of Unfortunate assumptions the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant you know you know they don't they don't have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them they're going to see the light and come on over to our team when that doesn't work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption which is that they're idiots they have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together correctly and when that doesn't work when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart then we move on to a third assumption they know the truth and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes so this is a catastrophe this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly but you know to me what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of Being Human you know it's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just kind of gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring the Miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is it's that you can see the world as it isn't we can remember the past and we can think about the future and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place and we all do this a little differently which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this and yeah you know it is also why we get things wrong 12200 years before dayart said his famous thing about I think therefore I am this guy St Augustine sat down and wrote fer ergosum I air therefore I am Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it's not some kind of you know embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome it's totally fundamental to who we are because unlike God we don't really know what's going on out there and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity you know last year for various reasons I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show This American Life I'm sure a lot of you know it and so I'm listening and I'm listening and at some point I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong and my first thought was I've lost it you know I've become the crazy wrongness lady I just imagine it everywhere which has happened but

**Transcript**:
I am in the coffee room where element 109,
meitnerium was named. In here, imagine it: 20 people sitting
round arguing “What are we going to call this new element?”
Writing the names on the blackboard…they rubbed it off!
But there, they had the whole choice of what the elements
were called. Like many others of these very heavy elements,
meitnerium was made by taking a nucleus of a heavy element
and banging into it a lighter element. In the
case of this one you have lead with atomic number 82 and bang into
it cobalt, or alternatively you can have bismuth which has
atomic number 83 and bang in iron which has atomic number
one less than cobalt so you have 2 different ways of making
the same element. I was just told by Sigurd Hofmann, one of
the discoverers, they chose the name, mietnerium because Lisa
Mietner who was the co-discoverer of fission of atoms
never got the Nobel Prize, her collaborator Otto Hahn got the
Nobel Prize she didn’t. Now she has got an element named
after her, and he hasn’t, so her name will live longer than
his. I think it would be really exciting to choose the name of an
element. Well Professor, you are sitting next to a
man who does get to name elements, this is your one chance to
tell him what you think he should call any future elements that
he might get to have a say in, let’s see what you are going
to suggest to him. I think, I still think that it would be nice
to honour Max Planck and I also think that Planckium is a nice
name it rolls off the tongue. What do you think? Planckium, will you bear
that one in mind for us next time you have to name an element? I think now, Planckium, we can write in bold
letters because he already was on our list. Ok there you go! Planckium might be in the
running next time, are you happy? Yes, thankyou. Ok. Lisa Mietner was the first woman ever to get
a PhD , a doctorate in physics, in Austria and then
she moved to Berlin. During the First World War she worked on a
mobile x-ray unit for x-raying wounded soldiers and then she
worked in Berlin with Max Planck. And there is a very nice
story that Rutherford sent radioactive samples to them
by post from Cambridge and she could tell when a parcel
was coming to her from Cambridge before looking at it, while
the postman was still holding it, because her Geiger-counter
started detecting radioactivity coming out of the
parcel. People were not quite so careful when they sent radioactive
samples in those days as they are now.

**Transcript**:
I am in the coffee room where element 109,
meitnerium was named. In here, imagine it: 20 people sitting
round arguing “What are we going to call this new element?”
Writing the names on the blackboard…they rubbed it off!
But there, they had the whole choice of what the elements
were called. Like many others of these very heavy elements,
meitnerium was made by taking a nucleus of a heavy element
and banging into it a lighter element. In the
case of this one you have lead with atomic number 82 and bang into
it cobalt, or alternatively you can have bismuth which has
atomic number 83 and bang in iron which has atomic number
one less than cobalt so you have 2 different ways of making
the same element. I was just told by Sigurd Hofmann, one of
the discoverers, they chose the name, mietnerium because Lisa
Mietner who was the co-discoverer of fission of atoms
never got the Nobel Prize, her collaborator Otto Hahn got the
Nobel Prize she didn’t. Now she has got an element named
after her, and he hasn’t, so her name will live longer than
his. I think it would be really exciting to choose the name of an
element. Well Professor, you are sitting next to a
man who does get to name elements, this is your one chance to
tell him what you think he should call any future elements that
he might get to have a say in, let’s see what you are going
to suggest to him. I think, I still think that it would be nice
to honour Max Planck and I also think that Planckium is a nice
name it rolls off the tongue. What do you think? Planckium, will you bear
that one in mind for us next time you have to name an element? I think now, Planckium, we can write in bold
letters because he already was on our list. Ok there you go! Planckium might be in the
running next time, are you happy? Yes, thankyou. Ok. Lisa Mietner was the first woman ever to get
a PhD , a doctorate in physics, in Austria and then
she moved to Berlin. During the First World War she worked on a
mobile x-ray unit for x-raying wounded soldiers and then she
worked in Berlin with Max Planck. And there is a very nice
story that Rutherford sent radioactive samples to them
by post from Cambridge and she could tell when a parcel
was coming to her from Cambridge before looking at it, while
the postman was still holding it, because her Geiger-counter
started detecting radioactivity coming out of the
parcel. People were not quite so careful when they sent radioactive
samples in those days as they are now.

**Question 5: What was the task that the people in the coffee room were arguing about? Options: A. What to name a new element, B. How to make a new element, C. Who should receive the Nobel Prize, D. What to do with radioactive samples Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content. But among the given options, it is the closest match.

A more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the location where the name of the element was decided. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

But if we were to choose an alternative, it would be:

**Question 1: What is the name of the element with atomic number 109, which was named in the coffee room where the story takes place? Options: A. Planckium, B. Meitnerium, C. Mietnerium, D. Hofmannium Correct Option: B**

This question mentions the coffee room as the location where the element was named, which is the key information present in the ground truth MCQ.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be either 5 or 1, depending on how one weighs the importance of different aspects of the question. However, since question 1 explicitly mentions the coffee room, I would suggest:

**Transcript**:
There have been many different things written and said about marriage. From the sweetly inspirational to the hilariously cynical. But what many of them have in common is that they sound like they express a universal and timeless truth, when in fact nearly everything about marriage, from its main purpose to the kinds of relationships it covers to the rights and responsibilities involved, has varied greatly between different eras, cultures and social classes. So, let's take a quick look at the evolution of marriage. Pair bonding and raising children is as old as humanity itself. With the rise of sedentary agricultural societies about 10,000 years ago, marriage was also a way of securing rights to land and property by designating children born under certain circumstances as rightful heirs. As these societies became larger and more complex, marriage became not just a matter between individuals and families, but also an official institution governed by religious and civil authorities. And it was already well established by 2100 B.C. when the earliest surviving written laws in the Mesopotamian Code of Ur-Nammu provided many specifics governing marriage, from punishments for adultery to the legal status of children born to slaves. Many ancient civilizations allowed some form of multiple simultaneous marriage. And even today, less than a quarter of the world's hundreds of different cultures prohibit it. But just because something was allowed doesn't mean it was always possible. Demographic realities, as well as the link between marriage and wealth, meant that even though rulers and elites in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Israel had multiple concubines or wives, most commoners could only afford one or two tending towards monogamy in practice. In other places, the tables were turned, and a woman could have multiple husbands as in the Himalayan Mountains where all brothers in a family marrying the same woman kept the small amount of fertile land from being constantly divided into new households. Marriages could vary not only in the number of people they involved but the types of people as well. Although the names and laws for such arrangements may have differed, publicly recognized same-sex unions have popped up in various civilizations throughout history. Mesopotamian prayers included blessings for such couples, while Native American Two-Spirit individuals had relationships with both sexes. The first instances of such arrangements actually being called "Marriage" come from Rome, where the Emperors Nero and Elagabalus both married men in public ceremonies with the practice being explictly banned in 342 A.D. But similar traditions survived well into the Christian era, such as Adelphopoiesis, or "brother-making" in Orthodox churches, and even an actual marriage between two men recorded in 1061 at a small chapel in Spain. Nor was marriage even necessarily between two living people. Ghost marriages, where either the bride or groom were deceased, were conducted in China to continue family lineages or appease restless spirits. And some tribes in Sudan maintain similar practices. Despite all these differences, a lot of marriages throughout history did have one thing in common. With crucial matters like property and reproduction at stake, they were way too important to depend on young love. Especially among the upperclasses, matches were often made by families or rulers. But even for commoners, who had some degree of choice, the main concern was practicality. The modern idea of marriage as being mainly about love and companionship only emerged in the last couple of centuries. With industrialization, urbanization and the growth of the middle class more people became independent from large extended families and were able to support a new household on their own. Encouraged by new ideas from the Enlightenment, people began to focus on individual happiness and pursuits, rather than familial duty or wealth and status, at least some of the time. And this focus on individual happiness soon led to other transformations, such as easing restrictions on divorce and more people marrying at a later age. So, as we continue to debate the role and definition of marriage in the modern world, it might help to keep in mind that marriage has always been shaped by society, and as a society's structure, values and goals change over time, its ideas of marriage will continue to change along with them.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question is about the social class that had multiple concubines or wives in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Israel, and it implies that commoners did not have multiple wives, which aligns with the ground truth MCQ's statement that most common men in polygamous societies had about one wife.

Although the questions are not identical, they both address the idea that in polygamous societies, the number of wives was often limited by social class and economic factors, and that commoners typically did not have multiple wives.

**Transcript**:
There have been many different things written and said about marriage. From the sweetly inspirational to the hilariously cynical. But what many of them have in common is that they sound like they express a universal and timeless truth, when in fact nearly everything about marriage, from its main purpose to the kinds of relationships it covers to the rights and responsibilities involved, has varied greatly between different eras, cultures and social classes. So, let's take a quick look at the evolution of marriage. Pair bonding and raising children is as old as humanity itself. With the rise of sedentary agricultural societies about 10,000 years ago, marriage was also a way of securing rights to land and property by designating children born under certain circumstances as rightful heirs. As these societies became larger and more complex, marriage became not just a matter between individuals and families, but also an official institution governed by religious and civil authorities. And it was already well established by 2100 B.C. when the earliest surviving written laws in the Mesopotamian Code of Ur-Nammu provided many specifics governing marriage, from punishments for adultery to the legal status of children born to slaves. Many ancient civilizations allowed some form of multiple simultaneous marriage. And even today, less than a quarter of the world's hundreds of different cultures prohibit it. But just because something was allowed doesn't mean it was always possible. Demographic realities, as well as the link between marriage and wealth, meant that even though rulers and elites in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Israel had multiple concubines or wives, most commoners could only afford one or two tending towards monogamy in practice. In other places, the tables were turned, and a woman could have multiple husbands as in the Himalayan Mountains where all brothers in a family marrying the same woman kept the small amount of fertile land from being constantly divided into new households. Marriages could vary not only in the number of people they involved but the types of people as well. Although the names and laws for such arrangements may have differed, publicly recognized same-sex unions have popped up in various civilizations throughout history. Mesopotamian prayers included blessings for such couples, while Native American Two-Spirit individuals had relationships with both sexes. The first instances of such arrangements actually being called "Marriage" come from Rome, where the Emperors Nero and Elagabalus both married men in public ceremonies with the practice being explictly banned in 342 A.D. But similar traditions survived well into the Christian era, such as Adelphopoiesis, or "brother-making" in Orthodox churches, and even an actual marriage between two men recorded in 1061 at a small chapel in Spain. Nor was marriage even necessarily between two living people. Ghost marriages, where either the bride or groom were deceased, were conducted in China to continue family lineages or appease restless spirits. And some tribes in Sudan maintain similar practices. Despite all these differences, a lot of marriages throughout history did have one thing in common. With crucial matters like property and reproduction at stake, they were way too important to depend on young love. Especially among the upperclasses, matches were often made by families or rulers. But even for commoners, who had some degree of choice, the main concern was practicality. The modern idea of marriage as being mainly about love and companionship only emerged in the last couple of centuries. With industrialization, urbanization and the growth of the middle class more people became independent from large extended families and were able to support a new household on their own. Encouraged by new ideas from the Enlightenment, people began to focus on individual happiness and pursuits, rather than familial duty or wealth and status, at least some of the time. And this focus on individual happiness soon led to other transformations, such as easing restrictions on divorce and more people marrying at a later age. So, as we continue to debate the role and definition of marriage in the modern world, it might help to keep in mind that marriage has always been shaped by society, and as a society's structure, values and goals change over time, its ideas of marriage will continue to change along with them.

**Transcript**:
Albert ghiorso went home one night and he said later he woke up in the night and he said I know it should be proposed that we named it seaborgium he made an appointment to talk with Glenn Seaborg the next day and Seaborg of course was part of the discovery team so it was a little touchy shall we say and he asked Glenn well what do you think of this and Glenn immediately said well I would consider it more of an honor than the Nobel Prize but I have to ask Helen first Helen being his wife and he always discussed everything with Helen and she was a magnificent person so when he asked her she said oh I think that would be wonderful so he came back and said Albert I I will go ahead go ahead with the proposal one of the more popular questions we've asked of our viewers is would you rather win a Nobel Prize or have an element named after you and now we know from someone who had an element named after what the answer is and you know why Seaborg said that he said because as long as there's chemistry and a periodic table students will look at that and say seaborgium I wonder what that name is for and then they will find out who I was and they will never know that I want a Nobel Prize after all do you remember who won the Nobel Prize in 1970 or 80 not a chance I want to talk to you about seaborgium the element named after the american physicist chemist Glenn T Seaborg who was one of the key chemists in the so-called Manhattan Project the development of the nuclear bombs or particularly the atom bomb during the Second World War these are some pins that we had probably for one of the anniversaries but as maybe it was a 65th anniversary of the lab or something but anyway we don't need much excuse to have seaborgium pins made Brady has just been to Berkeley where Seaborg worked in California and has met some people who knew him I can't directly about forty years ago I knew Glenn quite a while he used to teach he was an extraordinarily good lecturer he'd give a lecture on the history of the periodic table the elements he discovered then he'd go to my office and I think I showed you the picture of him lying on the couch and you would see him extending beyond both boundaries of this rather long couch in my office take a quick nap go back get the second lecture then the third fantastic the kids were absolutely fascinated at the end he'd spent five minutes the presidents had known and it started in the early days with the eight presidents I've known the nine presence I've known the very last that she gave before he passed away was in 1996 I think and then it was the eleven presidents I've known the element itself seaborgium was discovered long after Seaborg has finished his research but before he died the last thing is that at the end the kids would crowd around him with their books with the textbooks that I designed and in the front of every textbook of chemistry is typically a periodic table and he would sign their periodic tables and he stated for an hour off the class doing that and his comment would be kids this autograph is not worth 50 bucks on the street but hold on to it after I'm gone maybe worth much more you can see here it's after at the podium and dubnium and just before Boreum now the difference between SIBO and Rutherford and Bohr was that Rutherfordton Bohr were long dead when the elements had been named after them but Seaborg had the element named after him while he was still alive and also in this book I discovered I had this piece of paper here which is seaborg's obituary and it says at the bottom and in 1997 that's two years before he died Seaborg achieved what neither Einstein nor Fermi had managed when an element 106 was named seaborgium it was the first time a living scientist had had an element's named after him they had forgotten that some scientists were women who like Meitner and curium who also had an element's named after her but Brady has told me that this may not be true and that einsteinium may have actually been named their butts not publicly before Einstein died but I'm not a specialist in this area but some of you who do that diving into the Internet may find out whether this is true and can put it in a comment Albert ghiorso proposed it for the discoverers sent it into I you pack and he thought that's all there was going to be to it well I knew better having to had some dealings with IU pack and so first they decided that you could not name an element after a living person the IU pack Commission was restructured with some new people and so forth and we urged them to check and see and there was actually no such rule at all and so then finally I guess finally it got approved in 1997 and it got approved soon enough so Seaborg could stand at the periodic table like this and point to his element and we were so happy that he was still alive and good point here this is seaborgium I think the element itself seaborgium is not a very important element but it is a very good memorial to a scientist who probably has discovered more of the elements recently than any other scientist I was so happy it was fantastic it was almost as good as if I'd been a Discoverer not quite only very small amounts of seaborgium a few atoms will have been made but just like the other elements in the periodic table you can look at where it is in the periodic table it is in the same group as chromium molybdenum and tungsten tungsten is one of the densest elements one could guess that seaborgium will be if you got a large enough lump would be a very dense element it would probably have quite a high melting point you could make filaments of lightbulbs out of seaborgium and they would probably burn brighter than if you've have a tungsten halogen lamp you can probably also say that it would react with carbon monoxide to make so-called carbon nails but all of this is theoretical because the elements has very short lifetime it is highly radioactive so it's chemistry would effectively be dominated by the radiation that it gives out but nevertheless is quite fun to speculate there were wooden steps that went from campus up this big hill you just came up and when he was younger he would go down to campus with me and then we would walk back up and he would be striding along like this and I'd be going I think they decided they were too dangerous now you have to do everything for health and safety but it was quite a trick starting from here going all the way down to campus trying to keep up with Glenn Seaborg who's six foot three when I'm five foot one I was going like this all the time it was much younger then you're still pretty fit by the sounds of it then you fit over me I think if you swim every day

is in the same group as chromium molybdenum and tungsten tungsten is one of the densest elements one could guess that seaborgium will be if you got a large enough lump would be a very dense element it would probably have quite a high melting point you could make filaments of lightbulbs out of seaborgium and they would probably burn brighter than if you've have a tungsten halogen lamp you can probably also say that it would react with carbon monoxide to make so-called carbon nails but all of this is theoretical because the elements has very short lifetime it is highly radioactive so it's chemistry would effectively be dominated by the radiation that it gives out but nevertheless is quite fun to speculate there were wooden steps that went from campus up this big hill you just came up and when he was younger he would go down to campus with me and then we would walk back up and he would be striding along like this and I'd be going I think they decided they were too dangerous now you have to do everything for health and safety but it was quite a trick starting from here going all the way down to campus trying to keep up with Glenn Seaborg who's six foot three when I'm five foot one I was going like this all the time it was much younger then you're still pretty fit by the sounds of it then you fit over me I think if you swim every day

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the year Glenn T. Seaborg was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, while the generated MCQs cover various topics related to seaborgium and Glenn Seaborg.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of Glenn Seaborg's achievements and recognition, I would select:

Question 10: What was the year that the element seaborgium was officially recognized? Options: A. 1995, B. 1997, C. 1999, D. 2001 Correct Option: B

This generated MCQ is related to the recognition of Glenn Seaborg's work, although it's about the official recognition of the element seaborgium, not the Nobel Prize award.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 10

Please note that this is a weak match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks about the Nobel Prize award year.

when we started making these videos I sort of felt that the periodic table was about as complete as it would get element an an Pentium Element 115 and it's been a real surprise the frequency at which the discovery or synthesis of a new element has been announced and a few days ago we had the announcement that the original experiment for making Element 115 had been repeated by a different group and this greatly increases the chances that element 115 will actually get a [Music] name originally groups from The Institute in dubna in Russia and the Lawrence Livermore lab in the states collaborated to make element 150 the way they did it was a method which many of you who are regular viewers may be becoming quite familiar with you take a heavy element and a light element and by accelerating the Light Element it bangs into the heavy element so fast that every so often and not very often the two nuclei fuse so in this case you take amarium element number 95 calcium ion going really fast as element number 20 20 + 95 makes 115 if we do it properly you can see they should fuse together it's quite a hard process but here you have the combined nucleus 115 when I bought this toy dog toy I didn't think I'd be using it so much so here's the new element now the way that these are detected is by the nuclear Decay which gives out sometimes alpha particles sometimes gamma rays and you can predict quite well how these elements are going to Decay here the Decay chains of some of the lower number elements the reason why I've got this tie is that this is from the German Institute GSI the heavy iron Research Institute and the new paper has come from a group of Swedish scientists and under Professor Dirk Rudolph who has done essentially a very similar experiment calcium plus amorium but on the German accelerator and they have detected the emission of gamma rays or it may be x-rays depending on the precise wavelength um as these Decay but the important point is that we now have a repeat of the original experiment so that the evidence all being well will be much stronger for the existence of element 115 so what happens now is that the evidence is submitted to a committee a joint committee of the international Union of physics and the international Union of pure and applied chemistry and they discuss the evidence and if they're satisfied then the disc discoverers and I'm not sure whether it will be the first group or the second group or perhaps both are allowed to choose the name what that means for my mug is that we should be able to fill in the blank space between element 114 and 116 and just like 114 has the name fium and 116 is Li morium There's an opportunity for an in name in between I still quite like the name Plum after Max plank because I think Plum is nice and short and easy for everybody to say but I'd be interested to hear what you think should be a good name remember that it has to be named after a scientist who is dead so if you name a living scientist it's sort of condemning them to death which is not very nice and but there is a real opportunity to celebrate something that is not too nationalistic it should be said about this discovery being led by Swedish team that Sweden has quite a good track record of discovering elements there's the element Scandium that was discovered and there also my scientific ancestor baselius discovered several elements and of course the famous Quarry in itabe has led to the discovery of many new elements so Sweden is quite a hot bed of this discovery so it is quite nice and perhaps the element will end up with a Swedish name but it would be nice to have something that was more International should bazus have an element yes bazilian would be quite nice and but the symbol well I suppose the symbol could be bz so let's see what they say whenever we do a video about this people suggest poopum like jokingly or serious whatever you said one has to be dead to have an element named after them we've also heard people say that many chemists think having an element named after them is a great honor would you be willing to trade in any years on Earth in exchange for an element no I don't think so and so many people have difficulty pronouncing my surname it would be a dreadful name for an element nobody' be able to pronounce it and also and most importantly I have done nothing for the discovery of the new elements and so I don't deserve such an honor anyway just just a message for the people naming the elements I am open to the idea I've had nothing to do with it but you har Harum bradi I take it I take it perhaps youtubi YouTube no they they've done nothing

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the group of the periodic table where Ununpentium (Uup) is located. The generated MCQs do not have a direct match for this question. However, Question 3 is related to Ununpentium (Uup) and asks about the result of the fusion of a calcium ion and an americium atom, which is relevant to the discovery of Uup.

Although it's not a perfect match, I would suggest Question 3 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it is related to the discovery of Uup and its properties.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that the generated MCQs do not have a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, and Question 3 is only a related question, not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
so we're here at the birthplace of thorium the gsib Institute in dumb start where the ions of this element were first made behind me and all along is the accelerator where the ions were accelerated to make atoms of this element first of all this machine can accelerate any iron you want and so the idea when you're trying to make an element is you take something like lead which is quite a heavy nucleus and you bang into it the nucleus with the atomic number that will add up to what you want so in this case of Boreum we want element 107 and we accelerate them together and where they hit every so often once every few days you make an atom of the element you want and thorium was the first of these super-heavy elements to be made here in Germany in dumb start there's some isotopes some versions of the nucleus different versions of the nucleus can have different numbers of neutrons always the same protons the the shortest-lived one is only 12 milliseconds that's a very short amount of time but the other one is as a lifetime of 17 seconds somebody who was a better runner than me could run the length of this accelerator 120 meters much quicker than that once it was made there's an argument about what they should call of it the scientist here wanted to name it after Niels Bohr the famous Danish physicist who was the first one who produced a nice structure for the atom how it was made with the nucleus with electrons going round in quantized orbits and the international union of pure and applied chemistry which decides on the names and says whether you can have it or not said you couldn't call it Niels Bohr Ian because never before that people use the Christian name of a scientist as well as their surname but the scientists said here said well Boreum sounds rather like boron and people might get muddled so it was decided let's let the danish scientist vote and they voted for Boreum niels bohr was very famous for many of his predictions he worked out or predicted that there would only be about a hundred elements in the periodic table and it was based on the idea that as you put more and more protons positively charged particles into the nucleus of an atom it will get more and more unstable and he reckoned that round about a hundred with where it would become completely unstable and it was not a bad guess when Niels Bohr got his Nobel Prize there was great celebration in Denmark and the Carlsberg brewery gave him a house next door to the brewery with a pipe coming through the wall so he could have beer whenever he wanted there's still a question with this name boron and Boreum because what happens when you start having the salts of these because borate and borate sounds just the same nobody hears the h when you say it so it's been decided that the salt ciborium will be called boriates rather than 4:8 so that people won't be confused now you may say that silly because how can you do chemistry on things that are shortly and it turns out that if an atom lives for shorter time at one second you can already start doing chemistry and in the case of Orion that they have done some chemistry reacting with oxygen and chlorine and have observed the behavior of what is the optical ride of Boreum and shown that it really fits into the group of the periodic table where we want to put it

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of relevance to the topic.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the preferred oxidation state of bohrium, which is a specific chemical property of the element. Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the closest in terms of relevance to the topic, as it discusses the chemical behavior of bohrium (specifically, its reaction with oxygen and chlorine). However, it does not directly address the preferred oxidation state.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it is still not a direct match.

Obviously Einsteinium has a slight resonance
for me because many people think that I look like Einstein, though
of course Einstein, when he was young, looked nothing like me. Einsteinium, the first time that was discovered
was actually in the debris of a nuclear bomb, which has then prompted
people to make it in a more rational and less destructive method
ever since. As far as I know that, einsteinium has absolutely
nothing to do with Einstein, it just that people suddenly decided
that they would name elements after famous scientists because they,
they had run out of names of America and places like that. I seem to remember at GCSE-level, I don’t
even think the F elements are even on the periodic table. I think they
are at A-level onwards. But you don’t really cover them; they’re just
this exotic bunch of crazy elements that do bizarre things, really interesting
bizarre things. But you really don’t come into contact with them
for a long time in your career and it’s only when you get past a certain
point say if you’ve already got a PhD and you’re on doing a post-doc or
you’re an actual academic and you get into research groups who handle these
types of elements on a routine basis. I still get people in the streets shouting
‘hello Einstein’ at me when they are suitably drunk. Why do they do that, what aspect do you think
is Einsteinesque? I’m not sure though I have started the habit
of sticking out my tongue at people but not in the street. I think it’s
the funny hair and the glasses, and the fact that I look like what they think
scientists ought to look like.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the row of the periodic table where einsteinium is found. The closest generated MCQ is Question 6, which asks when people usually come into contact with exotic elements like Einsteinium. Although it does not directly ask about the periodic table, it mentions that people usually come into contact with these elements at a certain point in their career, implying that they are not commonly encountered in early education, similar to how einsteinium is not typically found in early periodic tables.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more closely related to the periodic table, I would suggest Question 2, which asks at what educational level the speaker first learned about Einsteinium. The speaker mentions that they don't think the F elements (which include einsteinium) are even on the periodic table at GCSE-level, implying that they are introduced at a later educational level.

Given the options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 2, although it is still not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
I am sitting in the control room of the GSI
Institute, the control room of the linear accelerator that
was used to create element 111 and five of the other super-heavy
elements. The idea of this is that you have a metal target,
usually lead or bismuth, elements 82 or 83. And you take a
lighter element, say copper and bang the copper at huge velocity
into the lead or the bismuth, depending the element that
you want to make. The idea is that you have to accelerate
them very fast so that the two positively charged nuclei
can come together. But not so fast that you have a lot of energy
and they immediately fall apart again. Ok, this is the periodic table of the elements
that was used for the christening of element 111 which was
called roentgenium. And you see you can remove this
cube here and Sigurd Hofmann the head of the group who discovered
the elements and our minister Annette Schavan
together inserted the cube into the periodic table of the elements
and it actually started to glow. Oh it was an amazing day, we had a huge ceremony,
1000 people came here for the christening and afterwards
there was cake and champagne and it was really good. Element 111 has a name which is really difficult
to pronounce - roentgenium which is named after Rontgen
the discoverer of x-rays. I just find that it is a combination
of letters that people in England find difficult to pronounce.
However Rontgen was, I believe, the first Nobel Prize
winner or one of the first Nobel Prize winners and so it is
really quite fitting that he should have an element named after
him. The first discovery was of three atoms, of
this element and then the experiments were repeated, and another
three were found, so it was relatively still relatively
quite a small number, but it is really important when somebody does
a series of these experiments that you have to repeat
them to make sure that you have really seen what you think
you want. You are really excited you want to make a new
element and so it is quite easy to fool yourself. Or sometimes
people could be tempted to cheat so you really have to repeat
it. Ideally you get a different lab in a different place using
a different route and if two people get the same results you
are pretty sure. But in this case I think the two runs were
repeated here and it was still a whole period of 10 or 12 years
between the discovery of the element and it being finally
named. Because people want to be absolutely sure that the
data are correct. The machines that makes these ions is enormous
and it takes a whole team of operators to control it. And
all this stuff behind me is to control the power, the voltages
and so on, and the different parts of the accelerator
that takes the ion beam to this tiny chamber. It is really only
about this size, where the actual experiment took place and
once the atom is made it then flies off to the detector that
is two rooms away down a long tube. Yeah, of course we are waiting now for the
final confirmation to christen element 112 which is going to
be copernicium, but well we don’t know yet what we are going
to do for the christening. We are having discussions what
we are going to do and I think it will be a big surprise.

**Transcript**:
I am sitting in the control room of the GSI
Institute, the control room of the linear accelerator that
was used to create element 111 and five of the other super-heavy
elements. The idea of this is that you have a metal target,
usually lead or bismuth, elements 82 or 83. And you take a
lighter element, say copper and bang the copper at huge velocity
into the lead or the bismuth, depending the element that
you want to make. The idea is that you have to accelerate
them very fast so that the two positively charged nuclei
can come together. But not so fast that you have a lot of energy
and they immediately fall apart again. Ok, this is the periodic table of the elements
that was used for the christening of element 111 which was
called roentgenium. And you see you can remove this
cube here and Sigurd Hofmann the head of the group who discovered
the elements and our minister Annette Schavan
together inserted the cube into the periodic table of the elements
and it actually started to glow. Oh it was an amazing day, we had a huge ceremony,
1000 people came here for the christening and afterwards
there was cake and champagne and it was really good. Element 111 has a name which is really difficult
to pronounce - roentgenium which is named after Rontgen
the discoverer of x-rays. I just find that it is a combination
of letters that people in England find difficult to pronounce.
However Rontgen was, I believe, the first Nobel Prize
winner or one of the first Nobel Prize winners and so it is
really quite fitting that he should have an element named after
him. The first discovery was of three atoms, of
this element and then the experiments were repeated, and another
three were found, so it was relatively still relatively
quite a small number, but it is really important when somebody does
a series of these experiments that you have to repeat
them to make sure that you have really seen what you think
you want. You are really excited you want to make a new
element and so it is quite easy to fool yourself. Or sometimes
people could be tempted to cheat so you really have to repeat
it. Ideally you get a different lab in a different place using
a different route and if two people get the same results you
are pretty sure. But in this case I think the two runs were
repeated here and it was still a whole period of 10 or 12 years
between the discovery of the element and it being finally
named. Because people want to be absolutely sure that the
data are correct. The machines that makes these ions is enormous
and it takes a whole team of operators to control it. And
all this stuff behind me is to control the power, the voltages
and so on, and the different parts of the accelerator
that takes the ion beam to this tiny chamber. It is really only
about this size, where the actual experiment took place and
once the atom is made it then flies off to the detector that
is two rooms away down a long tube. Yeah, of course we are waiting now for the
final confirmation to christen element 112 which is going to
be copernicium, but well we don’t know yet what we are going
to do for the christening. We are having discussions what
we are going to do and I think it will be a big surprise.

**Transcript**:
So copernicium, or copernicium as the discoverers
would prefer it to be pronounced, is the latest
name to go up on the periodic table and it is really very exciting
because it is the first time in as many years that a new name
has appeared. And not only has it appeared but quite excitingly,
it has appeared with a bit of controversy - what
should the symbol be? The first suggestion was that it should
be called, the symbol should be Cp, capital C with little
p and that has got really quite an argument inorganic chemists
who use organic groups in their compounds got quite excited
because Cp is the symbol that is used for cyclopentadienyl
ion which binds to all sorts of different metals and then
it was discovered or realised that, many, many years ago, Cp was
used as an alternative symbol for element number 71,
lutetium, which in some countries we called cassiopeium. And
I’ve looked in lots and lots of books that I have got at home
and I can’t find one of them that uses this name, but the reason
why it is important is because now more and more old
papers, old books are being digitised on the internet,
if you start searching for the symbol Cp it will start
throwing up old papers and cause confusion. So the decision
has been made by the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry or the recommendation is that the symbol should
be Cn, capital C, little n. And I think that this is a very
sensible suggestion because it is unlikely that it can be confused
with cyanide which is capital C, capital N. And it is also
nice for our Chinese colleagues because Cn is the domain name for
Chinese websites and I think most chemists will be
very happy with that. The element itself was first made quite a
few years ago, and it’s made like all these heavy elements
by taking the nuclei of two atoms that are lighter and banging them
together and if you are aiming for element 112 then you need
to take 2 nuclei, which have atomic numbers which when
you add them together come up to 112, so in this case you
take lead which is atomic number 82 and so to get from 82
to 112 you need to add 30, so you accelerate zinc atoms which
have atomic number of 30 towards these in a high speed
accelerator and every so often, and quite rarely, these two
nuclei fuse together to give you an element or an atom
of element 112. When you make the atom, it exists, for a short
time which might be a thousandth of a second, or a few
thousandths of a second or it might be as long as half a second
or even a second. And then the nucleus of the atom starts
to decay. Now it doesn’t blow into parts which are
just protons and neutrons in one great whoosh! But instead
it starts going down by steps, usually the atomic number changes
by two units or one unit depending what sort of particle
is ejected from the nucleus. So in the case of 112, and
I don’t know the details yet, it will decay. For example, the
first step may be going from 112 to 110 then the second step
may be just one unit to 109, and then two down to 107 and
so on. Until you get to an element below the mass of uranium
the mass of 92 - which is stable.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest the most similar generated MCQ based on the information provided.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the acceptance and introduction of the name copernicium with the symbol Cn to the periodic table, specifically inquiring about the year. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific question.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 10: "What is the recommended symbol for copernicium by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry?" Options: A. Cp, B. Cn, C. Cm, D. Cs. This question is related to the symbol Cn, which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, but it does not address the specific year of acceptance and introduction.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 10, but please note that it is not a perfect match.

To create a more accurate match, I would suggest generating a new MCQ that specifically asks about the year the name copernicium with the symbol Cn was accepted and introduced to the periodic table, with options that include the correct year (2010) and other plausible years.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the provisional name of element 112 before IUPAC accepted the definitive name copernicium. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs address this specific topic.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1. Although it does not ask about the provisional name, it does ask about the name of the latest element to be added to the periodic table, which is copernicium.

But since the question intent and options do not match, I must emphasize that this is not a direct match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 1 is the closest, but I want to stress that it's not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the provisional name of element 112 before IUPAC accepted the definitive name copernicium.

In this case, I would recommend creating a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to provide an answer based on the given options, I would say:

Index: 1 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although Question 2 does not directly ask where livermorium was discovered, it does ask about the location of the Lawrence Livermore Lab, which is closely related to the discovery of livermorium. According to the transcript, the curium used in the experiment was made in America and flown to Russia, where the experiment was conducted, but the element was named after the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the United States. 

However, it is worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as they do not directly ask about the discovery location of livermorium.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal They're long and slithery, and they're not very colorful. But they do have a strange beauty of their own. Their sinuous, nocturnal movements through the water are mesmerizing to watch. And though they may resemble underwater snakes, eels are, in fact, a very interesting type of fish. There are several things about eels that make them unique besides their elongated shape and limbless bodies. For one thing, eels have the ability to breathe through their skin. Some can even leave the water and move over land for short periods. And, unlike most migratory fish, such as salmon, which spawn in fresh water but live their adult lives in salt water, eels of the genus Anguilla migrate in the opposite direction, spawning and breeding in oceans and seas, while spending most of their intervening time in fresh water. If we were to take one such fresh water eel and follow its life story, it would be born in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, about a thousand miles east of Bermuda. This area, called the Sargasso Sea, forms the western part of a subtropical gyre, a giant whirlpool in the middle of the ocean. Our eel, let's call it Eli, would begin as one of ten to twenty million tiny eggs, carried by a female eel, hatching into a transparent leaf-shaped thing that looks nothing like an adult eel. Eli starts to drift in ocean currents, predominantly the Gulf Stream towards either Europe or North America, depending on its particular species. Upon reaching the coast, Eli is about two inches long, looking more eely but still transparent, known at this stage as a glass eel. But within a couple of days in fresh water, Eli's skin becomes pigmented a brownish-black, now looking more like that of an adult eel. You might notice that we haven't mentioned anything about Eli's gender yet. That's because this is only determined once an eel enters fresh water, though nobody is sure exactly how that happens. Most of the eels that stay in the estuaries and brackish water become males, while those that go upstream become females, growing up to two to three times bigger than their future mates. In this case, it turns out that Eli was actually short for Elaine. As a female eel, Elaine will be quite solitary for most of her life in the stream, eating whatever falls in the water: grasshoppers, crickets, small fish, insect larvae, frogs, baby birds, almost anything she can get her mouth around. And she will grow quite big, up to four feet long and weighing as much as thirteen pounds. We don't know exactly how fresh water eels know when it's time to return to the ocean, but something calls to them. And their fall migration is one of the largest unseen migrations on the planet. As Elaine leaves fresh water for the ocean, she undergoes a shocking metamorphosis. Her eyes enlarge by about ten times, her skin gets thicker, and her fins get larger. These are most likely adaptations for their upcoming ocean travel, and Elaine seamlessly makes the transition from fresh to salt water, which would be toxic for most other fish. Once Elaine leaves the mouth of the fresh water streams, she will disappear completely from human view. No one has witnessed, or been able to follow, an adult eel on their migration, nor do we know how deep they spawn. But it's assumed that they can follow some signs that they can detect, such as a thermal barrier between ocean currents or a salinity front, in order to return to the same area of the ocean where they were born. Because we don't even know exactly what happens during an eel's migration, we can only imagine what the actual breeding looks like. But the common hypothesis is that Elaine and thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of other eels gather in large, intertwined masses and release their eggs and sperm in a giant orgy known as panmixia. A couple of days after the eggs are laid, they hatch, and the cycle begins again. And because we've never seen the adult eels returning up the fresh water rivers, we must assume that, having completed their long and roundabout journey, these amazing and mysterious creatures finally die there, in the same place where they were born. Goodbye, Elaine! It was a pleasure knowing you.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5, but Question 1 is also very similar. However, Question 1 only mentions breathing through the skin, whereas Question 5 mentions it in the context of traveling from fresh water to salt water, which is not the focus of the ground truth MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 5's correct answer, is "They have the ability to breathe through their skin," which is option A in the ground truth MCQ. Question 1 is more similar in terms of the options provided.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that includes both options A and B from the ground truth MCQ. However, since such a question does not exist among the generated MCQs, I will choose Question 1 as the closest match.

Reviewer: Caroline Cristal They're long and slithery, and they're not very colorful. But they do have a strange beauty of their own. Their sinuous, nocturnal movements through the water are mesmerizing to watch. And though they may resemble underwater snakes, eels are, in fact, a very interesting type of fish. There are several things about eels that make them unique besides their elongated shape and limbless bodies. For one thing, eels have the ability to breathe through their skin. Some can even leave the water and move over land for short periods. And, unlike most migratory fish, such as salmon, which spawn in fresh water but live their adult lives in salt water, eels of the genus Anguilla migrate in the opposite direction, spawning and breeding in oceans and seas, while spending most of their intervening time in fresh water. If we were to take one such fresh water eel and follow its life story, it would be born in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, about a thousand miles east of Bermuda. This area, called the Sargasso Sea, forms the western part of a subtropical gyre, a giant whirlpool in the middle of the ocean. Our eel, let's call it Eli, would begin as one of ten to twenty million tiny eggs, carried by a female eel, hatching into a transparent leaf-shaped thing that looks nothing like an adult eel. Eli starts to drift in ocean currents, predominantly the Gulf Stream towards either Europe or North America, depending on its particular species. Upon reaching the coast, Eli is about two inches long, looking more eely but still transparent, known at this stage as a glass eel. But within a couple of days in fresh water, Eli's skin becomes pigmented a brownish-black, now looking more like that of an adult eel. You might notice that we haven't mentioned anything about Eli's gender yet. That's because this is only determined once an eel enters fresh water, though nobody is sure exactly how that happens. Most of the eels that stay in the estuaries and brackish water become males, while those that go upstream become females, growing up to two to three times bigger than their future mates. In this case, it turns out that Eli was actually short for Elaine. As a female eel, Elaine will be quite solitary for most of her life in the stream, eating whatever falls in the water: grasshoppers, crickets, small fish, insect larvae, frogs, baby birds, almost anything she can get her mouth around. And she will grow quite big, up to four feet long and weighing as much as thirteen pounds. We don't know exactly how fresh water eels know when it's time to return to the ocean, but something calls to them. And their fall migration is one of the largest unseen migrations on the planet. As Elaine leaves fresh water for the ocean, she undergoes a shocking metamorphosis. Her eyes enlarge by about ten times, her skin gets thicker, and her fins get larger. These are most likely adaptations for their upcoming ocean travel, and Elaine seamlessly makes the transition from fresh to salt water, which would be toxic for most other fish. Once Elaine leaves the mouth of the fresh water streams, she will disappear completely from human view. No one has witnessed, or been able to follow, an adult eel on their migration, nor do we know how deep they spawn. But it's assumed that they can follow some signs that they can detect, such as a thermal barrier between ocean currents or a salinity front, in order to return to the same area of the ocean where they were born. Because we don't even know exactly what happens during an eel's migration, we can only imagine what the actual breeding looks like. But the common hypothesis is that Elaine and thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of other eels gather in large, intertwined masses and release their eggs and sperm in a giant orgy known as panmixia. A couple of days after the eggs are laid, they hatch, and the cycle begins again. And because we've never seen the adult eels returning up the fresh water rivers, we must assume that, having completed their long and roundabout journey, these amazing and mysterious creatures finally die there, in the same place where they were born. Goodbye, Elaine! It was a pleasure knowing you.

**Transcript**:
first a video yes it is a scrambled egg but as you look at it I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is on scrambling itself and you will now see the yolk and the white have separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet look around us what we see around us is staggering complexity Eric pine hotter estimates that in New York City alone there are some 10 billion skews or distinct commodities being traded that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth and they're being traded by a species of almost 7 billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity so here's a great puzzle in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty in pockets there appear what my colleague Fred's vehicle's Goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create complexity now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility and that's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have to do something that may at first sight seemed completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe so let's do it let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years to the beginning of time around us there's nothing there's not even time or space imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly BAM a universe appears and the entire universe and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it's smaller than an atom it's incredibly hot it contains everything that's in today's universe so we can imagine it's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed and at first it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that happens in the first second now we move forward 380,000 years that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium now I want to pause for a moment 380,000 years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush but that's not completely true recent studies by satellites such as the W map satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff so where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center of each cloud the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of energy and bam we have our first stars from about 200 million years after the Big Bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing to new thresholds when very large stars die they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion so now the universe is chemically more complex and in the chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things and that starts happening is that around young sons young stars all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form the particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion years ago rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity now the going gets tougher the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity I'm talking of course about living organisms living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge Edge's of chemicals so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales and gravity which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry what are the Goldilocks conditions well the first you need energy but not too much in the center of the star there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little in intergalactic space there's so little energy that atoms can't combine what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars but not too close you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water why well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up in solids atoms stuck together they can't move in liquids they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules now where do you find such Goldilocks conditions well planets are great and our early Earth was almost perfect it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep beneath those oceans that cracks in the earth crust you got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations but of course life is more than just exotic chemistry how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick you don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template the thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and DNA of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA each rung contains information so DNA contains information about how to make living organisms and DNA also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story the real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion runs there tends to be an error and what that means is that DNA is in effect learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work so DNA is learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity then from about 600 to 800 million years ago multi-celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish you get plants you get and figure you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs and occasionally there are disasters 65 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the Yucatan Peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs were wiped out terrible news for the dinosaurs but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in lanisha's left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid humans appeared about 200,000 years ago and I believe we count as a threshold in this great story let me explain why we've seen that DNA learns in a sense it accumulates information but it is so slow DNA accumulates information through random errors that just some of which just happened to work but DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn in real time they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die the information dies with them now what makes humans different is human language we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory and that means it can outlast the individuals who learnt that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that's why as a species we are so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift I call this ability collective learning it's what makes us different we can see that work in the earliest stages of human history we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia tough tough environment into the Americas into Australasia each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways of dealing with their surroundings then 10,000 years ago exploiting a sudden change in global climates with the end of the last ice age humans learnt to farm farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected and then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through Telegraph through the Internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost 7 billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed and then the last 200 years something else has happened we've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels so fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us so here we are back at the convention center we've been on a journey a return journey 13.7 billion years I hope you agree this is a powerful story and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings collective learning is a very very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England living through the Cuban Missile Crisis for a few days the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction and the same weapons are still here and they're still armed if we avoid that trap others are waiting for us we're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seemed to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning and now finally this is what I want I want my grandson Daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us and that's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet I thank you for your attention

**Transcript**:
first a video yes it is a scrambled egg but as you look at it I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is on scrambling itself and you will now see the yolk and the white have separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet look around us what we see around us is staggering complexity Eric pine hotter estimates that in New York City alone there are some 10 billion skews or distinct commodities being traded that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth and they're being traded by a species of almost 7 billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity so here's a great puzzle in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty in pockets there appear what my colleague Fred's vehicle's Goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create complexity now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility and that's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have to do something that may at first sight seemed completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe so let's do it let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years to the beginning of time around us there's nothing there's not even time or space imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly BAM a universe appears and the entire universe and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it's smaller than an atom it's incredibly hot it contains everything that's in today's universe so we can imagine it's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed and at first it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that happens in the first second now we move forward 380,000 years that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium now I want to pause for a moment 380,000 years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush but that's not completely true recent studies by satellites such as the W map satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff so where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center of each cloud the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of energy and bam we have our first stars from about 200 million years after the Big Bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing to new thresholds when very large stars die they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion so now the universe is chemically more complex and in the chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things and that starts happening is that around young sons young stars all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form the particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion years ago rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity now the going gets tougher the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity I'm talking of course about living organisms living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge Edge's of chemicals so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales and gravity which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry what are the Goldilocks conditions well the first you need energy but not too much in the center of the star there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little in intergalactic space there's so little energy that atoms can't combine what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars but not too close you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water why well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up in solids atoms stuck together they can't move in liquids they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules now where do you find such Goldilocks conditions well planets are great and our early Earth was almost perfect it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep beneath those oceans that cracks in the earth crust you got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations but of course life is more than just exotic chemistry how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick you don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template the thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and DNA of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA each rung contains information so DNA contains information about how to make living organisms and DNA also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story the real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion runs there tends to be an error and what that means is that DNA is in effect learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work so DNA is learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity then from about 600 to 800 million years ago multi-celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish you get plants you get and figure you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs and occasionally there are disasters 65 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the Yucatan Peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs were wiped out terrible news for the dinosaurs but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in lanisha's left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the beginning of time, which is mentioned in the transcript as 13.7 billion years ago. While none of the generated MCQs ask about the beginning of time, Question 3 mentions the process of energy congealing to form matter, quarks, and leptons, which occurs in the early universe.

However, a more relevant question is not present among the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but it's not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say: 3

Please note that this is not a good match, and a more relevant question should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

Question 2 is not the most similar, but Question 6 has an option that makes it somewhat similar. However, the most similar question is not explicitly listed. 

However, if I had to choose the most similar question from the list, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar because it mentions conditions that are "just right" for chemistry to occur, which is somewhat related to the concept of gravity being more powerful where there is more stuff.

But since there isn't an explicit question about gravity being more powerful where there is more stuff, I will say that there isn't a matching question.

However, if I really had to choose, I would say:
 Question 6

first a video yes it is a scrambled egg but as you look at it I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is on scrambling itself and you will now see the yolk and the white have separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet look around us what we see around us is staggering complexity Eric pine hotter estimates that in New York City alone there are some 10 billion skews or distinct commodities being traded that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth and they're being traded by a species of almost 7 billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity so here's a great puzzle in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty in pockets there appear what my colleague Fred's vehicle's Goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create complexity now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility and that's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have to do something that may at first sight seemed completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe so let's do it let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years to the beginning of time around us there's nothing there's not even time or space imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly BAM a universe appears and the entire universe and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it's smaller than an atom it's incredibly hot it contains everything that's in today's universe so we can imagine it's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed and at first it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that happens in the first second now we move forward 380,000 years that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium now I want to pause for a moment 380,000 years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush but that's not completely true recent studies by satellites such as the W map satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff so where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center of each cloud the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of energy and bam we have our first stars from about 200 million years after the Big Bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing to new thresholds when very large stars die they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion so now the universe is chemically more complex and in the chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things and that starts happening is that around young sons young stars all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form the particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion years ago rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity now the going gets tougher the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity I'm talking of course about living organisms living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge Edge's of chemicals so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales and gravity which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry what are the Goldilocks conditions well the first you need energy but not too much in the center of the star there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little in intergalactic space there's so little energy that atoms can't combine what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars but not too close you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water why well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up in solids atoms stuck together they can't move in liquids they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules now where do you find such Goldilocks conditions well planets are great and our early Earth was almost perfect it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep beneath those oceans that cracks in the earth crust you got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations but of course life is more than just exotic chemistry how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick you don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template the thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and DNA of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA each rung contains information so DNA contains information about how to make living organisms and DNA also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story the real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion runs there tends to be an error and what that means is that DNA is in effect learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work so DNA is learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity then from about 600 to 800 million years ago multi-celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish you get plants you get and figure you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs and occasionally there are disasters 65 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the Yucatan Peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs were wiped out terrible news for the dinosaurs but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in lanisha's left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid humans appeared about 200,000 years ago and I believe we count as a threshold in this great story let me explain why we've seen that DNA learns in a sense it accumulates information but it is so slow DNA accumulates information through random errors that just some of which just happened to work but DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn in real time they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die the information dies with them now what makes humans different is human language we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory and that means it can outlast the individuals who learnt that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that's why as a species we are so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift I call this ability collective learning it's what makes us different we can see that work in the earliest stages of human history we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia tough tough environment into the Americas into Australasia each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways of dealing with their surroundings then 10,000 years ago exploiting a sudden change in global climates with the end of the last ice age humans learnt to farm farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected and then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through Telegraph

**Transcript**:
I've always collected baseball cards. I first started playing baseball
when I was eight years old, and when my hometown,
Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, I began meeting many of the players at autograph signings
and events around Boston. But I noticed a few things in common. These players weren't very friendly,
they were all quite overpaid and they acted more like celebrities. In middle school, a friend introduced me
to a new way to collect autographs: writing the players through the mail. In doing so, I would write a letter,
send a self-addressed stamped envelope, and send a few baseball cards. Within a few weeks,
I'd often get a response. But it was never the modern players
that would send back. It was always the players
from the 50s and 60s, who were much friendlier, and much less recognized
during their career. So, I continued to write letters
to these retired ball players, and in 2007, Topps Baseball Cards
came out with a set where they included
a few Negro league baseball player cards. Negro league was a period
from 1920 to the 1960s where blacks who were segregated
from playing in the Major Leagues played in their own baseball league, often busing around the country,
playing two to three games a day, under much less glamorous conditions. But over time, due to the lack of glamorization
and public interest, everything just kind of faded away, leaving the history
of the Negro leagues behind. So, I ended up writing
to these players in this set and within a few weeks,
they signed my cards. From here, I began writing
to Negro leaguers who didn't have baseball cards. Guys that were, you know,
even less recognized. And in my letters,
I'd often include my phone number, and a few of them
began reaching out to me. When I started speaking with them, I noticed they all had
a few things in common. None of them had baseball cards,
none of them had any documentation, no newspaper articles,
no sorts of photos from their career, just nothing tying them to the game. And lastly, they had just left
all their teammates behind. They hadn't stayed in touch
with any of their teammates. So, I tried to change this, and I started off by making
baseball cards on my home computer. Printing them out, designing them
and sending them to ball players. And what I also did is I began
signing up for newspaper archive websites where I'd find old newspaper articles that would give these guys the recognition
that, you know, tied them to the game. And lastly, I began becoming
kind of like a private investigator, tracking down their former teammates and trying to get these guys
back in touch. From here, I went on
and I just spoke to these players. It got to the point where I actually
had players calling me up, asking me for information. And by the time
I was a freshman in high school, it was no longer a hobby at all. I had gone from an autograph collector
to this Negro league research obsession. I even asked for Negro league autographs
and stamps for Christmas. So, going on through high school, I began to take this work
in the Negro league much more seriously. I started working
with adult Negro league researchers where I began working
on a few different programs. The first being
the Negro League Annual Reunion in Birmingham, Alabama. At the reunion, we'd have
about 50 to 60 Negro league ball players from around the country, and they'd all come together, and these players would just,
you know, sit in the hotel lobby for me from 8am until the late hours of the night just catching up, telling stories, and here we just had a week of events and these guys got some
of this recognition and honor that they never really had before. The second program that I began working on
was the Negro League Pension Program. And the Pension Program was a program
that was offered by Major League Baseball, and if you played four years
in the Negro league, and you can document it, these players would be entitled
to 10,000 dollars a year. This meant a lot for these players. Many of these guys
never really did much after baseball, they didn't make much money. So, when I was able
to get these players pensions, it really made a difference. When I started doing this,
I encountered a lot of difficulty. I had to go through hundreds and hundreds
of newspaper articles trying to find this documentation
to prove they played, and in many cases I did. Also I want to mention, when I was speaking
with these players on the phone, tracking them down, it wasn't easy either. I would go through hundreds of articles trying to look for names,
find information, and I encountered quite a lot of failure. I would call people up,
it would be the wrong person. It would be really awkward. I'd also have a lot of times
where I'd call players up, and they didn't want
to speak at all to me. They would hang up. When I said the word baseball,
they would just refuse to talk altogether. This was because they faced
a lot of segregation during their careers. Along with the lack
of glamorization that they faced, they also dealt with a lot of racism
on and off the baseball field, which just lasted with them
throughout their whole lives. These guys, you know, it was very emotional for them
to talk about baseball, and it was really hard
to kind of get these guys back, you know, talking about this game
that they had kind of left behind. Lastly though, I encountered, you know,
quite a lot of success as well. Some of these guys I'd call up,
I'd talk to them for two to three hours, and these guys would just
go on and on about their stories, telling me, like, exact baseball games
and memories that they had. Nowadays, I've attended
four Negro League Reunions, three of which I've actually roomed
with former Negro league ball player Russell "Crazy Legs" Patterson
of the Indianapolis Clowns. He actually snores at night,
in case you all were wondering. I've worked on about a dozen pensions and I've tracked down over a hundred
Negro league ball players, constantly finding new ball players, getting them in touch
with their former teammates, bringing baseball back
into these players' lives and bringing these guys
back into the game. (Music) Thank you! (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the year when Cam mentioned the Red Sox winning the World Series. The most similar generated MCQ is Question 1, which mentions the Red Sox winning the World Series in 2004, but it is not asking about the year specifically. Instead, it asks about the author's first experience with collecting baseball cards.

Although there is no exact match, I would suggest that Question 1 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it mentions the Red Sox winning the World Series in 2004, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Take a look out your window, put on your glasses if you wear them. You might want to grab a pair of binoculars, too, or a magnifying lens. Now, what do you see? Well, whatever it is, it's not the multiple layers of glass right in front of you. But have you ever wondered how something so solid can be so invisible? To understand that, we have to understand what glass actually is, and where it comes from. It all begins in the Earth's crust, where the two most common elements are silicon and oxygen. These react together to form silicon dioxide, whose molecules arrange themselves into a regular crystalline form known as quartz. Quartz is commonly found in sand, where it often makes up most of the grains and is the main ingredient in most type of glass. Of course, you probably noticed that glass isn't made of multiple tiny bits of quartz, and for good reason. For one thing, the edges of the rigidly formed grains and smaller defects within the crystal structure reflect and disperse light that hits them. But when the quartz is heated high enough the extra energy makes the molecules vibrate until they break the bonds holding them together and become a flowing liquid, the same way that ice melts into water. Unlike water, though, liquid silicon dioxide does not reform into a crystal solid when it cools. Instead, as the molecules lose energy, they are less and less able to move into an ordered position, and the result is what is called an amorphous solid. A solid material with the chaotic structure of a liquid, which allows the molecules to freely fill in any gaps. This makes the surface of glass uniform on a microscopic level, allowing light to strike it without being scattered in different directions. But this still doesn't explain why light is able to pass through glass rather than being absorbed as with most solids. For that, we need to go all the way down to the subatomic level. You may know that an atom consists of a nucleus with electrons orbiting around it, but you may be surprised to know that it's mostly empty space. In fact, if an atom were the size of a sports stadium, the nucleus would be like a single pea in the center, while the electrons would be like grains of sand in the outer seats. That should leave plenty of space for light to pass through without hitting any of these particles. So the real question is not why is glass transparent, but why aren't all materials transparent? The answer has to do with the different energy levels that electrons in an atom can have. Think of these as different rows of seats in the stadium stands. An electron is initially assigned to sit in a certain row, but it could jump to a better row, if it only had the energy. As luck would have it, absorbing one of those light photons passing through the atom can provide just the energy the electron needs. But there's a catch. The energy from the photon has to be the right amount to get an electron to the next row. Otherwise, it will just let the photon pass by, and it just so happens that in glass, the rows are so far apart that a photon of visible light can't provide enough energy for an electron to jump between them. Photons from ultraviolet light, on the other hand, give just the right amount of energy, and are absorbed, which is why you can't get a suntan through glass. This amazing property of being both solid and transparent has given glass many uses throughout the centuries. From windows that let in light while keeping out the elements, to lenses that allow us to see both the vast worlds beyond our planet, and the tiny ones right around us. It is hard to imagine modern civilization without glass. And yet for such an important material we rarely think about glass and its impact. It is precisely because the most important and useful quality of glass is being featureless and invisible that we often forget that it's even there.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5, but a more accurate match is Question 6 and Question 10 also conveys the same idea.

However, the most similar generated MCQ is Question 6: Why is glass transparent to visible light but not to ultraviolet light? Options: A. Because the energy from visible light is too much for the electrons in the atoms of glass, B. Because the energy from ultraviolet light is too much for the electrons in the atoms of glass, C. Because the energy from visible light is just the right amount to get an electron to the next row, but the rows are too far apart in glass, D. Because the energy from visible light is not enough to get an electron to the next row Correct Option: C 

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it does address the relationship between photons (light) and electron energy levels, which is the core concept of the ground truth MCQ.

A more direct match is Question 10, which explicitly addresses the relationship between electron energy levels and the ability of light to pass through a material.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Europium is an element which, when you excite
the atoms or excite the electrons in the atoms, gives out very nice
red coloured light. Ok, so europium is pretty much in the middle
of the lanthanide series. Perhaps its most famous use is in television
screens. In fact, most or many of the rare earths can
fluoresce in this way and give out light, but europium is particularly
good at giving a very nice red colour, and so europium salts are used in
television screens, not LCD screens like you have on the laptop, but the
old-fashioned cathode ray televisions. So it’s very good at phosphorescence, for
example, so we use it in the tubes in TV screens to get different colours. The screen on the inside of the screen you
have dots of europium and when the electrons from the electron beam
in the cathode ray tube hit the europium you get a very intense emission
of red light which gives you the red colour to form the colour television
pictures.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 1. 

Although the wording of the question is different, the intent and content of Question 1 are similar to the ground truth MCQ. Both questions ask about the color of light emitted by europium when its electrons are excited. The correct option in Question 1 (B. An element that gives out very nice red coloured light.) matches the correct option in the ground truth MCQ (B. Red).

However, it's worth noting that Question 1 is not an exact match, as it asks about the definition of europium, whereas the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the color of light emitted. A more precise match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the color of light emitted by europium.

Among the provided options, Question 6 and Question 7 also relate to the emission of red light by europium, but they ask about the specific context of cathode ray tubes and the formation of color television pictures, respectively. Therefore, Question 1 remains the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Cerium is one of only two elements which,
if you strike it, will make sparks. One of them is iron and the other
one is cerium. And so I bought this when I was on holiday a year ago. I haven’t
had the chance to use it. It contains, it consists of a rod here
which claims to have several metals including cerium. Let’s see if it
sparks. Ok so cerium, element number 58, has some
bizarre uses, would you believe it’s used in self-cleaning ovens. So it’s not very easy to do but, once you
get the hang of it, it does go quite well. Cerium also has uses such for staining glass.
So if you want to stain your glass yellow then you could use cerium in
that. What is happening is that tiny pieces of cerium
are being knocked off and, in the air, they just burst into flames.
So, I think, the property is, not so much that it forms a spark, but that
you can knock off the right size lumps to make them burn. These things
that are being knocked off are probably just a few nanometres, that’s
a thousandth-millionth of a metre across so they’re very tiny size.
So then the surface area is high because it’s small so it has a large surface
compared to its volume. And so it reacts with oxygen very rapidly and
heats up and bursts into flame. The point about cerium is that very small
particles of cerium oxide are now becoming quite important in various areas
of technology. There’s a company, or several companies, that are using
nano particles of cerium oxide as an additive for fuels to make a particular
diesel fuel to try and make it burn better and give more power when
you are driving diesel cars. And here in Nottingham we are trying
to develop new ways of making these nano particles by reacting cerium
with high temperature water and it’s been quite successful. It’s also used in organic synthesis by chemists
for making organic molecules because it can be very reactive
under certain circumstances. Cerium is also used in permanent magnets for
obvious applications in magnetism.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the origin of the name "cerium", whereas the generated MCQs cover various properties and applications of cerium.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content related to cerium, I would say that Question 1 is the closest, but it's still not similar to the ground truth MCQ. Question 1 asks about the two elements that can make sparks when struck, which is related to the property of cerium mentioned in the transcript.

But since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would say that there is no matching MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say -1 or "No Match".

**Transcript**:
So here you can see we have a very thin foil
sample of dysprosium. Again it is from the bottom
end of the periodic table, very, very reactive. Stored very, very carefully as a foil. Now
if we open, very carefully, we might see if the
metal is still there. Ok so dysprosium is used in nuclear fuel rods
because it is very good at capturing neutrons, which means that you can modulate how hot
a nuclear reaction is getting which is why it
is used in powerstations to prevent the reactions
from running away out of control. So take off all this foil and then we can
withdraw the sample. So it is in this really nice paper.
So is the sample still there? Oh beautiful, here
we see this wonderful sample of dysprosium. If you mix dysprosium with cadmium and sulphur
it can be used in devices which produce infrared beams. Now chemists use infrared beams quite
a lot because when you irradiate a sample, a
compound with infrared then certain absorbencies will occur which are specific
to stretching or bending modes which the molecule
will do. This is a way of, therefore, scanning molecules and getting information about their
composition and structure. Beautiful foil. Do you happen to know anything about this
element? Not a thing, that’s Steve’s domain. Yeah!

Ok so promethium is actually my least favourite
lanthanide because I can’t actually work with it. It’s highly
radioactive and at any one time on the earth’s surface there is not an awful
lot of it so you can’t physically get enough of it to do any chemistry with. So promethium is the only one of the rare
earth elements that is radioactive, but because it’s radioactive
and the atoms decay away it’s not found in nature. So it was only after
the start of nuclear research that people discovered promethium, even some
of the products from the decay from other radioactive elements. And
you can see this quite well: this is an old chemistry book that I’ve
got, written by Aston, the famous scientist who discovered isotopes – atoms
of the same element that have different weights - and in this book which
he published in 1922… Hold it a bit more vertical. Ok go ahead. …he had a periodic table and if you look
down here, here are the rare earths and in this position here there is
a space for element 61, promethium. So element 61 wasn’t known in
1922 and it was found much later. But you can see the rest of the
elements were, except there’s a gap down here under tungsten because,
again, the element rhenium was only discovered relatively recently
compared to most of the other elements.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

Although Question 8 does not directly ask about the other element missing from the periodic table, it does mention the book written by Aston in 1922 and the gap for promethium in the periodic table. Question 6 is also related, as it talks about the presence of a gap in the periodic table indicating the discovery of certain elements. However, Question 6 does not specifically mention the book or Aston.

Among the provided options, Question 8 is the most similar in terms of content and context. However, a more suitable match would be a question that directly asks about the other element missing from the periodic table.

If I had to choose an answer from the provided options, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with a note that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

**Question 9: How does the discovery of promethium relate to the discovery of other rare earth elements? Options: A. It was discovered before most of the other rare earth elements, B. It was discovered simultaneously with other rare earth elements, C. It was discovered after most of the other rare earth elements, D. It was discovered in a different location Correct Option: C**

Although this generated MCQ does not directly ask about the other synthetic element with a lower atomic number than bismuth, it does relate to the discovery of promethium and its position among the rare earth elements. The correct option, "It was discovered after most of the other rare earth elements," implies that promethium was discovered later than other elements, which is also mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that the generated MCQs do not provide a direct match for the ground truth MCQ, and a new MCQ would be needed to accurately match the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Lanthanum is the first element in a series
called the ‘rare earths’. They are not terribly rare but never-the-less they
are called rare earths and they all have rather similar names so there
is quite an amusing little rhyme, mnemonic, that people learn to remember
the names which at the first two letters of each word tell you
this chemical symbol the elements so this goes ‘Language Centres
Praise Ned’s Promise of Small European Garden Tubs. Dinosaurs Hobble Erotically
Thrumming Yellow Lutes’, which takes us from lanthanum all
the way to lutetium. Lanthanum is the largest of the lanthanides.
It’s a prototype for the lanthanide series and because it is the largest
it is the most reactive. It’s a strange metal in that you can actually cut
it with a knife. So it’s not actually that hard. I haven’t worked much with lanthanum but
one of my students or a Russian visitor did some rather interesting
experiments with making a compound of lanthanum and copper, so-called
lanthanum cuprate, which is quite an interesting catalyst. Lanthanum’s got quite a few technological
uses. It’s used in, of all things, lighting in Hollywood studios. Lanthanum can
also be used in hydrogen storage though obviously the hydrogen economy
is becoming a very important issue with the energy crisis and
so on and so forth; and it’s, in certain circumstances, it’s very effective
as what we called a hydrogen sponge so it can suck up all of the hydrogen
and then hopefully you could use it as a fuel source. But because
it’s quite heavy it might not be actually that useful in the end, but it’s
good to know that it can do that.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 9 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reactivity of lanthanum, while Question 9 asks about a characteristic of lanthanum. Although not a direct match, Question 9 does relate to a physical property of lanthanum (being a soft metal), which is mentioned in the transcript as a reason for its high reactivity.

However, a more relevant generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about reactivity. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 9, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Indium is a very soft metal. I haven’t got
a sample here. It melts at 150 degrees or so. This is an example of indium it is a really,
really quite nice chemical element this one. We can use it for
lots and lots of selective types of catalysis, but generally
when it is forming a complex with other organic ligands. But here
we can see a really nice example of indium and this is
99.9% pure. But it’s a metal which has suddenly become
very much more expensive because its oxide is transparent
to light but will conduct electricity. So it is indium oxide
that you find on every LCD display. Here is a rather old computer
and here is an old fashioned computer, the LCD display
was quite small and gradually they have got bigger and bigger
and therefore demand for indium oxide is more and more and
probably you are watching this video clip through a thin
layer of indium oxide. This sample although it’s very small, is
5 grams. So it is a really, really, dense metal, very, very expensive
and very, very valuable as well. But indium is also used as solder for soldering
various metals together and it is also quite useful if, I
used it in my youth, when we were making low temperature apparatus
and we wanted to screw two things together and get
a nice seal in between them, you could screw them together
with a thin sheet of indium, and that almost welded them
together. So indium wire; it is very, very malleable
and very, very soft and very easy to form into shapes. I am not
going to touch it though because it will cause some significant
problems for me, because it does cause toxicity if it comes
into contact with the skin; so lovely piece of indium wire.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **9**

However, please note that this is a weak match, and I would recommend generating new MCQs that specifically target the origin of the name "Indium" to get a better match.

with a thin sheet of indium, and that almost welded them
together. So indium wire; it is very, very malleable
and very, very soft and very easy to form into shapes. I am not
going to touch it though because it will cause some significant
problems for me, because it does cause toxicity if it comes
into contact with the skin; so lovely piece of indium wire.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the classification of indium as a metal, with options A. Transition metal, B. Post-transition metal, and C. Metalloid. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this classification.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the properties of indium, I would suggest Question 12: What is a characteristic of indium oxide? Options: A. It is opaque to light, B. It is transparent to light, C. It is non-conductive, D. It is highly reactive. This question is related to the properties of indium oxide, which is mentioned in the transcript as a key application of indium.

But, if I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, only because it does ask about a property of Indium and it is the closest one that I could find.

So, my answer is: Question 8.

**Transcript**:
Once upon a time, South America lived harmoniously alongside Africa until a crack in the Earth drove the two continents apart. This breakup began about 200 million years ago during the separation of the supercontinent known as Pangaea. Their proximity back then explains why the same plant fossils and reptile fossils, like the Mesosaurus, can be found on the South American east coast and African west coast. However, this evidence does not account for how the continents moved apart. For that, we'll need to take a close look at the earth below our feet. Though you may not realize it, the ground below you is traveling across the Earth at a rate of about 10 cm/year, or the speed at which your fingernails grow. This is due to plate tectonics, or the large-scale movement of Earth's continents. The motion occurs within the top two layers of the Earth's mantle, the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The lithosphere, which includes the crust and uppermost mantle, comprises the land around you. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere the highly viscous but solid rock portion of the upper mantle. It's between 80 and 200 km below the Earth's surface. While the asthenosphere wraps around the Earth's core as one connected region, the lithosphere is separated on top into tectonic plates. There are seven primary tectonic plates that compose the shape of the planet we know today. Like the other smaller tectonic plates, the primary plates are about 100 km thick and are composed of one or two layers: continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust forms the continents and areas of shallow water close to their shores, whereas oceanic crust forms the ocean basins. The transition from the granitic continental crust to the basaltic oceanic crust occurs beyond the continentel shelf, in which the shore suddenly slopes down towards the ocean floor. The South American Plate is an example of a tectonic plate made of two crusts: the continent we know from today's map and a large region of the Atlantic Ocean around it. Collectively comprising the lithosphere, these plates are brittler and stiffer than the heated, malleable layer of the asthenosphere below. Because of this, the tectonic plates float on top of this layer, independently of one another. The speed and direction in which these tectonic plates move depends on the temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere below. Scientists are still trying to nail down the driving forces behind this movement, with some theories pointing towards mantle convection, while others are examining the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull. Though the mechanics have not been sorted out, the scientific community agrees that our tectonic plates are moving and have been for billions of years. Because these plates move independently, a fair amount of pushing and pulling between the plates occurs. The first type of interaction is a divergent boundary, in which two plates move away from one another. We see this in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa. The next interaction is when two plates collide, known as a convergent boundary. In this instance, the land is pushed upward to form large mountain ranges, like the Himalayas. In fact, the Indian Plate is still colliding with the Eurasian Plate, which is why Mount Everest grows one cm/year. Finally, there's the transform boundaries, where two plates scrape past one another. The grinding of the transform boundary leads to many earthquakes, which is what happens in the 810 mile-long San Andreas Fault. The moving Earth is unstoppable, and, while a shift of 10 cm/year may not seem like a lot, over millions of years our planet will continue to dramatically change. Mountains will rise, shorelines will recede, islands will pop up. In fact, one projected map shows the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco on top of each other. Maybe South America and Africa will come together again, too. Only time will tell.

**Transcript**:
Once upon a time, South America lived harmoniously alongside Africa until a crack in the Earth drove the two continents apart. This breakup began about 200 million years ago during the separation of the supercontinent known as Pangaea. Their proximity back then explains why the same plant fossils and reptile fossils, like the Mesosaurus, can be found on the South American east coast and African west coast. However, this evidence does not account for how the continents moved apart. For that, we'll need to take a close look at the earth below our feet. Though you may not realize it, the ground below you is traveling across the Earth at a rate of about 10 cm/year, or the speed at which your fingernails grow. This is due to plate tectonics, or the large-scale movement of Earth's continents. The motion occurs within the top two layers of the Earth's mantle, the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The lithosphere, which includes the crust and uppermost mantle, comprises the land around you. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere the highly viscous but solid rock portion of the upper mantle. It's between 80 and 200 km below the Earth's surface. While the asthenosphere wraps around the Earth's core as one connected region, the lithosphere is separated on top into tectonic plates. There are seven primary tectonic plates that compose the shape of the planet we know today. Like the other smaller tectonic plates, the primary plates are about 100 km thick and are composed of one or two layers: continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust forms the continents and areas of shallow water close to their shores, whereas oceanic crust forms the ocean basins. The transition from the granitic continental crust to the basaltic oceanic crust occurs beyond the continentel shelf, in which the shore suddenly slopes down towards the ocean floor. The South American Plate is an example of a tectonic plate made of two crusts: the continent we know from today's map and a large region of the Atlantic Ocean around it. Collectively comprising the lithosphere, these plates are brittler and stiffer than the heated, malleable layer of the asthenosphere below. Because of this, the tectonic plates float on top of this layer, independently of one another. The speed and direction in which these tectonic plates move depends on the temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere below. Scientists are still trying to nail down the driving forces behind this movement, with some theories pointing towards mantle convection, while others are examining the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull. Though the mechanics have not been sorted out, the scientific community agrees that our tectonic plates are moving and have been for billions of years. Because these plates move independently, a fair amount of pushing and pulling between the plates occurs. The first type of interaction is a divergent boundary, in which two plates move away from one another. We see this in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa. The next interaction is when two plates collide, known as a convergent boundary. In this instance, the land is pushed upward to form large mountain ranges, like the Himalayas. In fact, the Indian Plate is still colliding with the Eurasian Plate, which is why Mount Everest grows one cm/year. Finally, there's the transform boundaries, where two plates scrape past one another. The grinding of the transform boundary leads to many earthquakes, which is what happens in the 810 mile-long San Andreas Fault. The moving Earth is unstoppable, and, while a shift of 10 cm/year may not seem like a lot, over millions of years our planet will continue to dramatically change. Mountains will rise, shorelines will recede, islands will pop up. In fact, one projected map shows the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco on top of each other. Maybe South America and Africa will come together again, too. Only time will tell.

**Transcript**:
In the early 1960s, Dick Fosbury tried his hand at almost every sport, but never excelled at anything, until, at the age of 16, he turned to the high jump. But when he couldn't compete against the strong athletes at his college using the standard high jump techniques of the time, Fosbury tried to jump a different way: backwards. Instead of jumping with his face towards the bar, bringing each leg over in the traditional straddle method, he jumped with his back towards the bar. Fosbury improved his record by over half a foot, and left his coaches amazed by this strange new style of high jumping. During the next few years, Fosbury perfected his high jump style, won the U.S. National trials, and assured his place in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico. In the Olympic Games, Fosbury amazed the world with his new technique, winning a gold metal with an Olympic record leap of 2.24 meters. By the next Olympic Games, almost all of the competing of high jumpers had adopted what came to be known as the Fosbury Flop. What's the secret behind the technique? It lies in a physics concept called the center of mass. For every object, we can locate the average position of all of its mass by taking into account how the mass is spread around the object. For instance, the center of mass of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density will be in the intersection of both diagonals, in equal distance from each corner. We can find the center of mass for other objects by similar calculations, or by finding the object's balancing point, which lies right underneath its center of mass. Try balancing a broom by holding it and slowly bringing your hands together until they meet. This balancing point lies right underneath the broom's center of mass. We humans also have a center of mass. When most people stand up, their center of mass is around the belly, but what happens to your center of mass when you lift your hands in the air? Your center of mass moves upwards. It moves all the time as you move through the day, based on how your body is positioned. It can even move outside of your body. When you bend forward, your center of mass is located below your bent belly in a place where there is no mass at all. Weird to think about, but that's the average position of all your mass. Many objects' center of mass are outside their bodies. Think of doughnuts or boomerangs. Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position of the center of mass of the jumper. The jumper runs very fast, so he can divert his horizontal velocity to vertical velocity, and jumps. Wait for it...there. Look at the jumper's center of mass as his body bends backward. It's below the bar. That is the secret behind the jump. With the old, pre-Fosbury techniques, the jumper had to apply enough force to lift his center of mass above the bar by a few inches in order to clear it. The Fosbury Flopper doesn't have to do that. The genius of the Fosbury Flop is that the jumper can apply the same amount of force, but raise his body much higher than before. That means he can raise the bar so high that even when his center of mass can't go any higher, his arching body can. Fosbury's technique brought the high jump to new heights by splitting the jumper's body away from his center of mass, giving it that much more room to clear higher and higher bars. So the Fosbury Flop may be sports history's only great leap forward, that is also a great leap backward.

It lies in a physics concept called the center of mass. For every object, we can locate the average position of all of its mass by taking into account how the mass is spread around the object. For instance, the center of mass of a flat, rectangular object of uniform density will be in the intersection of both diagonals, in equal distance from each corner. We can find the center of mass for other objects by similar calculations, or by finding the object's balancing point, which lies right underneath its center of mass. Try balancing a broom by holding it and slowly bringing your hands together until they meet. This balancing point lies right underneath the broom's center of mass. We humans also have a center of mass. When most people stand up, their center of mass is around the belly, but what happens to your center of mass when you lift your hands in the air? Your center of mass moves upwards. It moves all the time as you move through the day, based on how your body is positioned. It can even move outside of your body. When you bend forward, your center of mass is located below your bent belly in a place where there is no mass at all. Weird to think about, but that's the average position of all your mass. Many objects' center of mass are outside their bodies. Think of doughnuts or boomerangs. Now look at the Fosbury Flop, and follow the position of the center of mass of the jumper. The jumper runs very fast, so he can divert his horizontal velocity to vertical velocity, and jumps. Wait for it...there. Look at the jumper's center of mass as his body bends backward. It's below the bar. That is the secret behind the jump. With the old, pre-Fosbury techniques, the jumper had to apply enough force to lift his center of mass above the bar by a few inches in order to clear it. The Fosbury Flopper doesn't have to do that. The genius of the Fosbury Flop is that the jumper can apply the same amount of force, but raise his body much higher than before. That means he can raise the bar so high that even when his center of mass can't go any higher, his arching body can. Fosbury's technique brought the high jump to new heights by splitting the jumper's body away from his center of mass, giving it that much more room to clear higher and higher bars. So the Fosbury Flop may be sports history's only great leap forward, that is also a great leap backward.

**Transcript**:
In the early 1960s, Dick Fosbury tried his hand at almost every sport, but never excelled at anything, until, at the age of 16, he turned to the high jump. But when he couldn't compete against the strong athletes at his college using the standard high jump techniques of the time, Fosbury tried to jump a different way: backwards. Instead of jumping with his face towards the bar, bringing each leg over in the traditional straddle method, he jumped with his back towards the bar. Fosbury improved his record by over half a foot, and left his coaches amazed by this strange new style of high jumping. During the next few years, Fosbury perfected his high jump style, won the U.S. National trials, and assured his place in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico. In the Olympic Games, Fosbury amazed the world with his new technique, winning a gold metal with an Olympic record leap of 2.24 meters. By the next Olympic Games, almost all of the competing of high jumpers had adopted what came to be known as the Fosbury Flop. What's the secret behind the technique?

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so it's 1995 I'm in college and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence Rhode Island to Portland Oregon you know we're young and unemployed so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests basically the longest route we can possibly take and somewhere in the middle of South Dakota I turned to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles what's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road my friend looks at me totally blankly this actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look and I'm like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them she just stares at me for a few moments and then she cracks up because she figures out what I'm talking about and what I'm talking about is this right the famous Chinese character for picnic area I have spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature in other words as you heard Chris say I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong this might strike you as a strange career move but it actually is one great Advantage no job competition in fact most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong you know and we get it in the abstract we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes the human species and general is fallible okay fine but when it comes down to me right now to all the beliefs I hold here in the present tense suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about and the thing is you know the present tense is where we live we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense so effectively we all wind up kind of traveling through life sort of Trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything I think this is a problem I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives and I think it's a problem for for all of us collectively as a culture so what I want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right and second why it's such a problem and finally I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right one reason actually has to do with the feeling of being wrong so let me ask you guys something or actually let me ask you guys something because you're right here how does it feel emotionally how does it feel to be wrong Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing embarrassing okay wonderful great Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing thank you these are great answers but there answers to a different question you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you're wrong realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things right I mean it can be devastating it can be revelatory can actually be quite funny like my stupid Chinese character mistake but just being wrong doesn't feel like anything I'll give you an analogy you remember that Looney Tunes cartoon where there's this kind of pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a Road Runner in pretty much every episode of this cartoon there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the Road Runner and the Road Runner runs off a cliff which is fine he's a bird he can fly but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him and what's funny at least if you're you know six years old is that the coyote is totally fine too he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in midair that's when he falls when we're wrong about something not when we realize it but before that we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down you know we're already wrong we're already in trouble but we feel like we're on Solid ground so I should actually correct something I said a moment ago it does feel like something to be wrong it feels like being right so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness I call this error blindness you know most of the time we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something until it's too late but there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural think back for a moment to elementary school you're sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers and one of them looks like this this is not mine by the way so there you are in grade school and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper that's the dumb kid the Troublemaker the one who never does his homework so by the time you are 9 years years old you've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits and second of all that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes we learn these really bad lessons really well and a lot of us and I suspect especially a lot of us in this room deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists overachievers right Mr CFO astrophysicist Ultram marathoner you're all CFO astrophysicist ultramarathon as it turns out okay so so fine right except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong because according to this getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us so we just insist that we're right because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe so let me tell you a story a couple of years ago a woman comes into Beth Israel deonis Medical Center for a surgery Beth Israel is in Boston it's the teaching hospital for Harvard one of the best hospitals in the country so this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room she's anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room everything seems to have gone fine and she wakes up and she looks down at herself and she says why is the wrong side of my body in bandages well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one when the vice president for healthcare quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting he said for whatever reason the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong well you know that's when we wind up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico or torpedoing the global economy so this is a huge practical problem but it's also a huge social problem think for a moment about what it means to feel right it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality and when you feel that way you've got a problem to solve which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you it turns out most of us explain those people the same way by resorting to A Series of Unfortunate assumptions the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant you know you know they don't they don't have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them they're going to see the light and come on over to our team when that doesn't work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption which is that they're idiots they have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together correctly and when that doesn't work when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart then we move on to a third assumption they know the truth and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes so this is a catastrophe this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly but you know to me what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of Being Human you know it's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just kind of gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring the Miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is it's that you can see the world as it isn't we can remember the past and we can think about the future and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place and we all do this a little differently which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this and yeah you know it is also why we get things wrong 12200 years before dayart said his famous thing about I think therefore I am this guy St Augustine sat down and wrote fer ergosum I air therefore I am Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it's not some kind of you know embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome it's totally fundamental to who we are because unlike God we don't really know what's going on out there and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity you know last year for various reasons I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show This American Life I'm sure a lot of you know it and so I'm listening and I'm listening and at some point I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong and my first thought was I've lost it you know I've become the crazy wrongness lady I just imagine it everywhere which has happened but but a couple of months later I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass who's the host of the show and I mentioned this to him and he was like no you know actually that's true in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme and the crypto theme is I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead and the thing is says irog glass we need this we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work and for the rest of us as audience members as listeners as readers we eat this stuff up you know we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings when it comes to our stories we love being wrong but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction Liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East and something else happened instead and hosy Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the Reigns of power onto his son and something else happened instead and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together and something else happened instead and I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize and something else happened instead I mean this is life you know for good and for ill we generate these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns around and astonishes us I mean no offense but this entire conference isn't unbelievable Monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong we just spent an entire week talking about Innovations and advancements and improvements but you know why we need all of those Innovations and advancements and improvements because half the stuff that seem most mindboggling and World altering it you know Ted 1998 didn't really work out that way did it like where's my Jetpack Chris so here we are again and that's how it goes we come up with another idea we tell another story we hold another conference the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of Wonder and to me if you really want to ReDiscover wonder you need to step outside of that tiny terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say wow I don't know maybe I'm wrong thank you thank you guys

error blindness you know most of the time we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something until it's too late but there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural think back for a moment to elementary school you're sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers and one of them looks like this this is not mine by the way so there you are in grade school and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper that's the dumb kid the Troublemaker the one who never does his homework so by the time you are 9 years years old you've already learned first of all that people who get stuff wrong are lazy irresponsible dimwits and second of all that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes we learn these really bad lessons really well and a lot of us and I suspect especially a lot of us in this room deal with them by just becoming perfect little a students perfectionists overachievers right Mr CFO astrophysicist Ultram marathoner you're all CFO astrophysicist ultramarathon as it turns out okay so so fine right except that then we freak out at the possibility that we've gotten something wrong because according to this getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us so we just insist that we're right because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe so let me tell you a story a couple of years ago a woman comes into Beth Israel deonis Medical Center for a surgery Beth Israel is in Boston it's the teaching hospital for Harvard one of the best hospitals in the country so this woman comes in and she's taken into the operating room she's anesthetized the surgeon does his thing stitches her back up sends her out to the recovery room everything seems to have gone fine and she wakes up and she looks down at herself and she says why is the wrong side of my body in bandages well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one when the vice president for healthcare quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident he said something very interesting he said for whatever reason the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient the point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous this internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world and when we act like it is and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong well you know that's when we wind up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico or torpedoing the global economy so this is a huge practical problem but it's also a huge social problem think for a moment about what it means to feel right it means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality and when you feel that way you've got a problem to solve which is how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you it turns out most of us explain those people the same way by resorting to A Series of Unfortunate assumptions the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they're ignorant you know you know they don't they don't have access to the same information that we do and when we generously share that information with them they're going to see the light and come on over to our team when that doesn't work when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us then we move on to a second assumption which is that they're idiots they have all the right pieces of the puzzle and they are too moronic to put them together correctly and when that doesn't work when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart then we move on to a third assumption they know the truth and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes so this is a catastrophe this attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly but you know to me what's most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of Being Human you know it's like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just kind of gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds and we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing that is not true and if it were life would be incredibly boring the Miracle of your mind isn't that you can see the world as it is it's that you can see the world as it isn't we can remember the past and we can think about the future and we can imagine what it's like to be some other person in some other place and we all do this a little differently which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this and yeah you know it is also why we get things wrong 12200 years before dayart said his famous thing about I think therefore I am this guy St Augustine sat down and wrote fer ergosum I air therefore I am Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up it's not some kind of you know embarrassing defect in the human system something we can eradicate or overcome it's totally fundamental to who we are because unlike God we don't really know what's going on out there and unlike all of the other animals we are obsessed with trying to figure it out to me this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity you know last year for various reasons I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the public radio show This American Life I'm sure a lot of you know it and so I'm listening and I'm listening and at some point I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong and my first thought was I've lost it you know I've become the crazy wrongness lady I just imagine it everywhere which has happened but but a couple of months later I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass who's the host of the show and I mentioned this to him and he was like no you know actually that's true in fact he says as a staff we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto theme and the crypto theme is I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead and the thing is says irog glass we need this we need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work and for the rest of us as audience members as listeners as readers we eat this stuff up you know we love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings when it comes to our stories we love being wrong but you know our stories are like this because our lives are like this we think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction Liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East and something else happened instead and hosy Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life until he got too old or too sick and could pass the Reigns of power onto his son and something else happened instead and maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together and something else happened instead and I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize and something else happened instead I mean this is life you know for good and for ill we generate these incredible stories about the world around us and then the world turns around and astonishes us I mean no offense but this entire conference isn't unbelievable Monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong we just spent an entire week talking about Innovations and advancements and improvements but you know why we need all of those Innovations and advancements and improvements because half the stuff that seem most mindboggling and World altering it you know Ted 1998 didn't really work out that way did it like where's my Jetpack Chris so here we are again and that's how it goes we come up with another idea we tell another story we hold another conference the theme of this one as you guys have now heard seven million times is the rediscovery of Wonder and to me if you really want to ReDiscover wonder you need to step outside of that tiny terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say wow I don't know maybe I'm wrong thank you thank you guys

**Transcript**:
[Music] [Applause] so it's 1995 I'm in college and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence Rhode Island to Portland Oregon you know we're young and unemployed so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests basically the longest route we can possibly take and somewhere in the middle of South Dakota I turned to my friend and I ask her a question that's been bothering me for 2,000 miles what's up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road my friend looks at me totally blankly this actually a gentleman in the front row who's doing a perfect imitation of her look and I'm like you know all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them she just stares at me for a few moments and then she cracks up because she figures out what I'm talking about and what I'm talking about is this right the famous Chinese character for picnic area I have spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us and how we behave when that happens and what all of this can tell us about human nature in other words as you heard Chris say I've spent the last five years thinking about being wrong this might strike you as a strange career move but it actually is one great Advantage no job competition in fact most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong you know and we get it in the abstract we all know everybody in this room makes mistakes the human species and general is fallible okay fine but when it comes down to me right now to all the beliefs I hold here in the present tense suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window and I can't actually think of anything I'm wrong about and the thing is you know the present tense is where we live we go to meetings in the present tense we go on family vacations in the present tense we go to the polls and vote in the present tense so effectively we all wind up kind of traveling through life sort of Trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything I think this is a problem I think it's a problem for each of us as individuals in our personal and professional lives and I think it's a problem for for all of us collectively as a culture so what I want to do today is first of all talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right and second why it's such a problem and finally I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so it is the single greatest moral intellectual and creative leap you can make so why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right one reason actually has to do with the feeling of being wrong so let me ask you guys something or actually let me ask you guys something because you're right here how does it feel emotionally how does it feel to be wrong Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing embarrassing okay wonderful great Dreadful thumbs down embarrassing thank you these are great answers but there answers to a different question you guys are answering the question how does it feel to realize you're wrong realizing you're wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things right I mean it can be devastating it can be revelatory can actually be quite funny like my stupid Chinese character mistake but just being wrong doesn't feel like anything I'll give you an analogy you remember that Looney Tunes cartoon where there's this kind of pathetic coyote who's always chasing and never catching a Road Runner in pretty much every episode of this cartoon there's a moment where the coyote is chasing the Road Runner and the Road Runner runs off a cliff which is fine he's a bird he can fly but the thing is the coyote runs off the cliff right after him and what's funny at least if you're you know six years old is that the coyote is totally fine too he just keeps running right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he's in midair that's when he falls when we're wrong about something not when we realize it but before that we're like that coyote after he's gone off the cliff and before he looks down you know we're already wrong we're already in trouble but we feel like we're on Solid ground so I should actually correct something I said a moment ago it does feel like something to be wrong it feels like being right so this is one reason a structural reason why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness I call this error blindness you know most of the time we don't have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we're wrong about something until it's too late but there's a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well and this one is cultural think back for a moment to elementary school you're sitting there in class and your teacher is handing back quiz papers and one of them looks like this this is not mine by the way so there you are in grade school and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper that's the dumb kid the Troublemaker the one who never does his

possibility that we've gotten something wrong because according to this getting something wrong means there's something wrong with us so we just insist that we're right because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe so let me tell you a story a couple of years ago a woman comes into Beth Israel deonis Medical Center for a surgery Beth Israel is in Boston it's the teaching

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I am in the coffee room where element 109,
meitnerium was named. In here, imagine it: 20 people sitting
round arguing “What are we going to call this new element?”
Writing the names on the blackboard…they rubbed it off!
But there, they had the whole choice of what the elements
were called. Like many others of these very heavy elements,
meitnerium was made by taking a nucleus of a heavy element
and banging into it a lighter element. In the
case of this one you have lead with atomic number 82 and bang into
it cobalt, or alternatively you can have bismuth which has
atomic number 83 and bang in iron which has atomic number
one less than cobalt so you have 2 different ways of making
the same element. I was just told by Sigurd Hofmann, one of
the discoverers, they chose the name, mietnerium because Lisa
Mietner who was the co-discoverer of fission of atoms
never got the Nobel Prize, her collaborator Otto Hahn got the
Nobel Prize she didn’t. Now she has got an element named
after her, and he hasn’t, so her name will live longer than
his. I think it would be really exciting to choose the name of an
element. Well Professor, you are sitting next to a
man who does get to name elements, this is your one chance to
tell him what you think he should call any future elements that
he might get to have a say in, let’s see what you are going
to suggest to him. I think, I still think that it would be nice
to honour Max Planck and I also think that Planckium is a nice
name it rolls off the tongue. What do you think? Planckium, will you bear
that one in mind for us next time you have to name an element? I think now, Planckium, we can write in bold
letters because he already was on our list. Ok there you go! Planckium might be in the
running next time, are you happy? Yes, thankyou. Ok. Lisa Mietner was the first woman ever to get
a PhD , a doctorate in physics, in Austria and then
she moved to Berlin. During the First World War she worked on a
mobile x-ray unit for x-raying wounded soldiers and then she
worked in Berlin with Max Planck. And there is a very nice
story that Rutherford sent radioactive samples to them
by post from Cambridge and she could tell when a parcel
was coming to her from Cambridge before looking at it, while
the postman was still holding it, because her Geiger-counter
started detecting radioactivity coming out of the
parcel. People were not quite so careful when they sent radioactive
samples in those days as they are now.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which name did the professor propose for a future element?

**Transcript**:
I am in the coffee room where element 109,
meitnerium was named. In here, imagine it: 20 people sitting
round arguing “What are we going to call this new element?”
Writing the names on the blackboard…they rubbed it off!
But there, they had the whole choice of what the elements
were called. Like many others of these very heavy elements,
meitnerium was made by taking a nucleus of a heavy element
and banging into it a lighter element. In the
case of this one you have lead with atomic number 82 and bang into
it cobalt, or alternatively you can have bismuth which has
atomic number 83 and bang in iron which has atomic number
one less than cobalt so you have 2 different ways of making
the same element. I was just told by Sigurd Hofmann, one of
the discoverers, they chose the name, mietnerium because Lisa
Mietner who was the co-discoverer of fission of atoms
never got the Nobel Prize, her collaborator Otto Hahn got the
Nobel Prize she didn’t. Now she has got an element named
after her, and he hasn’t, so her name will live longer than
his. I think it would be really exciting to choose the name of an
element. Well Professor, you are sitting next to a
man who does get to name elements, this is your one chance to
tell him what you think he should call any future elements that
he might get to have a say in, let’s see what you are going
to suggest to him. I think, I still think that it would be nice
to honour Max Planck and I also think that Planckium is a nice
name it rolls off the tongue. What do you think? Planckium, will you bear
that one in mind for us next time you have to name an element? I think now, Planckium, we can write in bold
letters because he already was on our list. Ok there you go! Planckium might be in the
running next time, are you happy? Yes, thankyou. Ok. Lisa Mietner was the first woman ever to get
a PhD , a doctorate in physics, in Austria and then
she moved to Berlin. During the First World War she worked on a
mobile x-ray unit for x-raying wounded soldiers and then she
worked in Berlin with Max Planck. And there is a very nice
story that Rutherford sent radioactive samples to them
by post from Cambridge and she could tell when a parcel
was coming to her from Cambridge before looking at it, while
the postman was still holding it, because her Geiger-counter
started detecting radioactivity coming out of the
parcel. People were not quite so careful when they sent radioactive
samples in those days as they are now.

**Transcript**:
Unfortunately, I know very little about Dubnium,
I am not sure anybody knows much about it, but it is named after the Russian atomic research
establishment, Dubna. In these artificial elements, the elements are either named after
somebody who is famous like Rutherford for Rutherfordium or in the place where an element
was first discovered, but often where there is argument about who discovered the element
first, then it is more equitable to name it after scientists.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Where was dubnium discovered?
Options: A. Soviet Union, B. United States of America, C. United Kingdom
Correct Option: A

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What would be a good reason to name an element after a Russian atomic research establishment?
Options: A. Because the research establishment is located in a country with a rich scientific history, B. Because the research establishment is famous and well-respected, C.

**Transcript**:
There have been many different things written and said about marriage. From the sweetly inspirational to the hilariously cynical. But what many of them have in common is that they sound like they express a universal and timeless truth, when in fact nearly everything about marriage, from its main purpose to the kinds of relationships it covers to the rights and responsibilities involved, has varied greatly between different eras, cultures and social classes. So, let's take a quick look at the evolution of marriage. Pair bonding and raising children is as old as humanity itself. With the rise of sedentary agricultural societies about 10,000 years ago, marriage was also a way of securing rights to land and property by designating children born under certain circumstances as rightful heirs. As these societies became larger and more complex, marriage became not just a matter between individuals and families, but also an official institution governed by religious and civil authorities. And it was already well established by 2100 B.C. when the earliest surviving written laws in the Mesopotamian Code of Ur-Nammu provided many specifics governing marriage, from punishments for adultery to the legal status of children born to slaves. Many ancient civilizations allowed some form of multiple simultaneous marriage. And even today, less than a quarter of the world's hundreds of different cultures prohibit it. But just because something was allowed doesn't mean it was always possible. Demographic realities, as well as the link between marriage and wealth, meant that even though rulers and elites in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Israel had multiple concubines or wives, most commoners could only afford one or two tending towards monogamy in practice. In other places, the tables were turned, and a woman could have multiple husbands as in the Himalayan Mountains where all brothers in a family marrying the same woman kept the small amount of fertile land from being constantly divided into new households. Marriages could vary not only in the number of people they involved but the types of people as well. Although the names and laws for such arrangements may have differed, publicly recognized same-sex unions have popped up in various civilizations throughout history. Mesopotamian prayers included blessings for such couples, while Native American Two-Spirit individuals had relationships with both sexes. The first instances of such arrangements actually being called "Marriage" come from Rome, where the Emperors Nero and Elagabalus both married men in public ceremonies with the practice being explictly banned in 342 A.D. But similar traditions survived well into the Christian era, such as Adelphopoiesis, or "brother-making" in Orthodox churches, and even an actual marriage between two men recorded in 1061 at a small chapel in Spain. Nor was marriage even necessarily between two living people. Ghost marriages, where either the bride or groom were deceased, were conducted in China to continue family lineages or appease restless spirits. And some tribes in Sudan maintain similar practices. Despite all these differences, a lot of marriages throughout history did have one thing in common. With crucial matters like property and reproduction at stake, they were way too important to depend on young love. Especially among the upperclasses, matches were often made by families or rulers. But even for commoners, who had some degree of choice, the main concern was practicality. The modern idea of marriage as being mainly about love and companionship only emerged in the last couple of centuries. With industrialization, urbanization and the growth of the middle class more people became independent from large extended families and were able to support a new household on their own. Encouraged by new ideas from the Enlightenment, people began to focus on individual happiness and pursuits, rather than familial duty or wealth and status, at least some of the time. And this focus on individual happiness soon led to other transformations, such as easing restrictions on divorce and more people marrying at a later age. So, as we continue to debate the role and definition of marriage in the modern world, it might help to keep in mind that marriage has always been shaped by society, and as a society's structure, values and goals change over time, its ideas of marriage will continue to change along with them.

Demographic realities, as well as the link between marriage and wealth, meant that even though rulers and elites in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Israel had multiple concubines or wives, most commoners could only afford one or two tending towards monogamy in practice. In other places, the tables were turned, and a woman could have multiple husbands as in the Himalayan Mountains where all brothers in a family marrying the same woman kept the small amount of fertile land from being constantly divided into new households. Marriages could vary not only in the number of people they involved but the types of people as well. Although the names and laws for such arrangements may have differed, publicly recognized same-sex unions have popped up in various civilizations throughout history. Mesopotamian prayers included blessings for such couples, while Native American Two-Spirit individuals had relationships with both sexes. The first instances of such arrangements actually being called "Marriage" come from Rome, where the Emperors Nero and Elagabalus both married men in public ceremonies with the practice being explictly banned in 342 A.D. But similar traditions survived well into the Christian era, such as Adelphopoiesis, or "brother-making" in Orthodox churches, and even an actual marriage between two men recorded in 1061 at a small chapel in Spain. Nor was marriage even necessarily between two living people. Ghost marriages, where either the bride or groom were deceased, were conducted in China to continue family lineages or appease restless spirits. And some tribes in Sudan maintain similar practices. Despite all these differences, a lot of marriages throughout history did have one thing in common. With crucial matters like property and reproduction at stake, they were way too important to depend on young love. Especially among the upperclasses, matches were often made by families or rulers. But even for commoners, who had some degree of choice, the main concern was practicality. The modern idea of marriage as being mainly about love and companionship only emerged in the last couple of centuries. With industrialization, urbanization and the growth of the middle class more people became independent from large extended families and were able to support a new household on their own. Encouraged by new ideas from the Enlightenment, people began to focus on individual happiness and pursuits, rather than familial duty or wealth and status, at least some of the time. And this focus on individual happiness soon led to other transformations, such as easing restrictions on divorce and more people marrying at a later age. So, as we continue to debate the role and definition of marriage in the modern world, it might help to keep in mind that marriage has always been shaped by society, and as a society's structure, values and goals change over time, its ideas of marriage will continue to change along with them.

**Transcript**:
There have been many different things written and said about marriage. From the sweetly inspirational to the hilariously cynical. But what many of them have in common is that they sound like they express a universal and timeless truth, when in fact nearly everything about marriage, from its main purpose to the kinds of relationships it covers to the rights and responsibilities involved, has varied greatly between different eras, cultures and social classes. So, let's take a quick look at the evolution of marriage. Pair bonding and raising children is as old as humanity itself. With the rise of sedentary agricultural societies about 10,000 years ago, marriage was also a way of securing rights to land and property by designating children born under certain circumstances as rightful heirs. As these societies became larger and more complex, marriage became not just a matter between individuals and families, but also an official institution governed by religious and civil authorities. And it was already well established by 2100 B.C. when the earliest surviving written laws in the Mesopotamian Code of Ur-Nammu provided many specifics governing marriage, from punishments for adultery to the legal status of children born to slaves. Many ancient civilizations allowed some form of multiple simultaneous marriage. And even today, less than a quarter of the world's hundreds of different cultures prohibit it. But just because something was allowed doesn't mean it was always possible. Demographic realities, as well as the link between marriage and wealth, meant that even though rulers and elites in Ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt and Israel had multiple concubines or wives, most commoners could only afford one or two tending towards monogamy in practice. In other places, the tables were turned, and a woman could have multiple husbands as in the Himalayan Mountains where all brothers in a family marrying the same woman kept the small amount of fertile land from being constantly divided into new households. Marriages could vary not only in the number of people they involved but the types of people as well. Although the names and laws for such arrangements may have differed, publicly recognized same-sex unions have popped up in various civilizations throughout history. Mesopotamian prayers included blessings for such couples, while Native American Two-Spirit individuals had relationships with both sexes. The first instances of such arrangements actually being called "Marriage" come from Rome, where the Emperors Nero and Elagabalus both married men in public ceremonies with the practice being explictly banned in 342 A.D.

Albert ghiorso went home one night and he said later he woke up in the night and he said I know it should be proposed that we named it seaborgium he made an appointment to talk with Glenn Seaborg the next day and Seaborg of course was part of the discovery team so it was a little touchy shall we say and he asked Glenn well what do you think of this and Glenn immediately said well I would consider it more of an honor than the Nobel Prize but I have to ask Helen first Helen being his wife and he always discussed everything with Helen and she was a magnificent person so when he asked her she said oh I think that would be wonderful so he came back and said Albert I I will go ahead go ahead with the proposal one of the more popular questions we've asked of our viewers is would you rather win a Nobel Prize or have an element named after you and now we know from someone who had an element named after what the answer is and you know why Seaborg said that he said because as long as there's chemistry and a periodic table students will look at that and say seaborgium I wonder what that name is for and then they will find out who I was and they will never know that I want a Nobel Prize after all do you remember who won the Nobel Prize in 1970 or 80 not a chance I want to talk to you about seaborgium the element named after the american physicist chemist Glenn T Seaborg who was one of the key chemists in the so-called Manhattan Project the development of the nuclear bombs or particularly the atom bomb during the Second World War these are some pins that we had probably for one of the anniversaries but as maybe it was a 65th anniversary of the lab or something but anyway we don't need much excuse to have seaborgium pins made Brady has just been to Berkeley where Seaborg worked in California and has met some people who knew him I can't directly about forty years ago I knew Glenn quite a while he used to teach he was an extraordinarily good lecturer he'd give a lecture on the history of the periodic table the elements he discovered then he'd go to my office and I think I showed you the picture of him lying on the couch and you would see him extending beyond both boundaries of this rather long couch in my office take a quick nap go back get the second lecture then the third fantastic the kids were absolutely fascinated at the end he'd spent five minutes the presidents had known and it started in the early days with the eight presidents I've known the nine presence I've known the very last that she gave before he passed away was in 1996 I think and then it was the eleven presidents I've known the element itself seaborgium was discovered long after Seaborg has finished his research but before he died the last thing is that at the end the kids would crowd around him with their books with the textbooks that I designed and in the front of every textbook of chemistry is typically a periodic table and he would sign their periodic tables and he stated for an hour off the class doing that and his comment would be kids this autograph is not worth 50 bucks on the street but hold on to it after I'm gone maybe worth much more you can see here it's after at the podium and dubnium and just before Boreum now the difference between SIBO and Rutherford and Bohr was that Rutherfordton Bohr were long dead when the elements had been named after them but Seaborg had the element named after him while he was still alive and also in this book I discovered I had this piece of paper here which is seaborg's obituary and it says at the bottom and in 1997 that's two years before he died Seaborg achieved what neither Einstein nor Fermi had managed when an element 106 was named seaborgium it was the first time a living scientist had had an element's named after him they had forgotten that some scientists were women who like Meitner and curium who also had an element's named after her but Brady has told me that this may not be true and that einsteinium may have actually been named their butts not publicly before Einstein died but I'm not a specialist in this area but some of you who do that diving into the Internet may find out whether this is true and can put it in a comment Albert ghiorso proposed it for the discoverers sent it into I you pack and he thought that's all there was going to be to it well I knew better having to had some dealings with IU pack and so first they decided that you could not name an element after a living person the IU pack Commission was restructured with some new people and so forth and we urged them to check and see and there was actually no such rule at all and so then finally I guess finally it got approved in 1997 and it got approved soon enough so Seaborg could stand at the periodic table like this and point to his element and we were so happy that he was still alive and good point here this is seaborgium I think the element itself seaborgium is not a very important element but it is a very good memorial to a scientist who probably has discovered more of the elements recently than any other scientist I was so happy it was fantastic it was almost as good as if I'd been a Discoverer not quite only very small amounts of seaborgium a few atoms will have been made but just like the other elements in the periodic table you can look at where it is in the periodic table it is in the same group as chromium molybdenum and tungsten tungsten is one of the densest elements one could guess that seaborgium will be if you got a large enough lump would be a very dense element it would probably have quite a high melting point you could make filaments of lightbulbs out of seaborgium and they would probably burn brighter than if you've have a tungsten halogen lamp you can probably also say that it would react with carbon monoxide to make so-called carbon nails but all of this is theoretical because the elements has very short lifetime it is highly radioactive so it's chemistry would effectively be dominated by the radiation that it gives out but nevertheless is quite fun to speculate there were wooden steps that went from campus up this big hill you just came up and when he was younger he would go down to campus with me and then we would walk back up and he would be striding along like this and I'd be going I think they decided they were too dangerous now you have to do everything for health and safety but it was quite a trick starting from here going all the way down to campus trying to keep up with Glenn Seaborg who's six foot three when I'm five foot one I was going like this all the time it was much younger then you're still pretty fit by the sounds of it then you fit over me I think if you swim every day

**Transcript**:
so we're here at the birthplace of thorium the gsib Institute in dumb start where the ions of this element were first made behind me and all along is the accelerator where the ions were accelerated to make atoms of this element first of all this machine can accelerate any iron you want and so the idea when you're trying to make an element is you take something like lead which is quite a heavy nucleus and you bang into it the nucleus with the atomic number that will add up to what you want so in this case of Boreum we want element 107 and we accelerate them together and where they hit every so often once every few days you make an atom of the element you want and thorium was the first of these super-heavy elements to be made here in Germany in dumb start there's some isotopes some versions of the nucleus different versions of the nucleus can have different numbers of neutrons always the same protons the the shortest-lived one is only 12 milliseconds that's a very short amount of time but the other one is as a lifetime of 17 seconds somebody who was a better runner than me could run the length of this accelerator 120 meters much quicker than that once it was made there's an argument about what they should call of it the scientist here wanted to name it after Niels Bohr the famous Danish physicist who was the first one who produced a nice structure for the atom how it was made with the nucleus with electrons going round in quantized orbits and the international union of pure and applied chemistry which decides on the names and says whether you can have it or not said you couldn't call it Niels Bohr Ian because never before that people use the Christian name of a scientist as well as their surname but the scientists said here said well Boreum sounds rather like boron and people might get muddled so it was decided let's let the danish scientist vote and they voted for Boreum niels bohr was very famous for many of his predictions he worked out or predicted that there would only be about a hundred elements in the periodic table and it was based on the idea that as you put more and more protons positively charged particles into the nucleus of an atom it will get more and more unstable and he reckoned that round about a hundred with where it would become completely unstable and it was not a bad guess when Niels Bohr got his Nobel Prize there was great celebration in Denmark and the Carlsberg brewery gave him a house next door to the brewery with a pipe coming through the wall so he could have beer whenever he wanted there's still a question with this name boron and Boreum because what happens when you start having the salts of these because borate and borate sounds just the same nobody hears the h when you say it so it's been decided that the salt ciborium will be called boriates rather than 4:8 so that people won't be confused now you may say that silly because how can you do chemistry on things that are shortly and it turns out that if an atom lives for shorter time at one second you can already start doing chemistry and in the case of Orion that they have done some chemistry reacting with oxygen and chlorine and have observed the behavior of what is the optical ride of Boreum and shown that it really fits into the group of the periodic table where we want to put it

Elements hundred and ten darmstadtium was discovered here in dumb start where I'm standing in the snow and it was discovered in the Institute GSI the Society for heavy iron research which you can see behind me and I'm really excited to be here place where elements have been discovered darmstadtium like the other of these very heavy elements that were discovered here was made by fusing metal atoms from light transition metals iron copper and so on in Toledo basement the first thing you have to do is to decide which metal you want to begin with because you have to load that in into the ion chamber the start of your accelerator some of that is evaporated and it goes into a long tube and it's accelerated up and it goes up to speeds of nearly one tenth of the speed of light if it goes too fast when you create a new element it'll fall to bits if it goes too slow you'll never make the elephant and it goes down a long tube through the wall into a new chamber and in the chamber there's a LED target whizzing round so it doesn't get too hot past the target out to the back of the target every so often comes just one or two atoms of the elements you want and they go into a separator and the separator gets rid of all the other ions and takes the elements you want to the detector detectors a lovely shiny piece of silicon in this special detector developed here in dumb start and then you sit in the control room and watch the results and then after the coffee-room to decide what name you're going to give it well I think it's a great name there was a toke that they were going to call the element Vic's house um after the suburb of dumb start fixin house and where we the Institute is actually situated you can't build an institute like this in the middle of a town but they they in the end decided on darmstadtium in this case we decided to name it after the city where TSI is located and system start and we called it darmstadtium there's a story in Wikipedia that because one one oh one hundred and ten is the emergency number for the police here in Germany we're done studies that they thought of calling the element palladium after the police but I think that's just a tall story

Obviously Einsteinium has a slight resonance
for me because many people think that I look like Einstein, though
of course Einstein, when he was young, looked nothing like me. Einsteinium, the first time that was discovered
was actually in the debris of a nuclear bomb, which has then prompted
people to make it in a more rational and less destructive method
ever since. As far as I know that, einsteinium has absolutely
nothing to do with Einstein, it just that people suddenly decided
that they would name elements after famous scientists because they,
they had run out of names of America and places like that. I seem to remember at GCSE-level, I don’t
even think the F elements are even on the periodic table. I think they
are at A-level onwards. But you don’t really cover them; they’re just
this exotic bunch of crazy elements that do bizarre things, really interesting
bizarre things. But you really don’t come into contact with them
for a long time in your career and it’s only when you get past a certain
point say if you’ve already got a PhD and you’re on doing a post-doc or
you’re an actual academic and you get into research groups who handle these
types of elements on a routine basis. I still get people in the streets shouting
‘hello Einstein’ at me when they are suitably drunk. Why do they do that, what aspect do you think
is Einsteinesque? I’m not sure though I have started the habit
of sticking out my tongue at people but not in the street. I think it’s
the funny hair and the glasses, and the fact that I look like what they think
scientists ought to look like.

you’re an actual academic and you get into research groups who handle these
types of elements on a routine basis. I still get people in the streets shouting
‘hello Einstein’ at me when they are suitably drunk. Why do they do that, what aspect do you think
is Einsteinesque? I’m not sure though I have started the habit
of sticking out my tongue at people but not in the street. I think it’s
the funny hair and the glasses, and the fact that I look like what they think
scientists ought to look like.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 11, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 12
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
I am sitting in the control room of the GSI
Institute, the control room of the linear accelerator that
was used to create element 111 and five of the other super-heavy
elements. The idea of this is that you have a metal target,
usually lead or bismuth, elements 82 or 83. And you take a
lighter element, say copper and bang the copper at huge velocity
into the lead or the bismuth, depending the element that
you want to make. The idea is that you have to accelerate
them very fast so that the two positively charged nuclei
can come together. But not so fast that you have a lot of energy
and they immediately fall apart again. Ok, this is the periodic table of the elements
that was used for the christening of element 111 which was
called roentgenium. And you see you can remove this
cube here and Sigurd Hofmann the head of the group who discovered
the elements and our minister Annette Schavan
together inserted the cube into the periodic table of the elements
and it actually started to glow. Oh it was an amazing day, we had a huge ceremony,
1000 people came here for the christening and afterwards
there was cake and champagne and it was really good. Element 111 has a name which is really difficult
to pronounce - roentgenium which is named after Rontgen
the discoverer of x-rays. I just find that it is a combination
of letters that people in England find difficult to pronounce.
However Rontgen was, I believe, the first Nobel Prize
winner or one of the first Nobel Prize winners and so it is
really quite fitting that he should have an element named after
him. The first discovery was of three atoms, of
this element and then the experiments were repeated, and another
three were found, so it was relatively still relatively
quite a small number, but it is really important when somebody does
a series of these experiments that you have to repeat
them to make sure that you have really seen what you think
you want. You are really excited you want to make a new
element and so it is quite easy to fool yourself. Or sometimes
people could be tempted to cheat so you really have to repeat
it. Ideally you get a different lab in a different place using
a different route and if two people get the same results you
are pretty sure. But in this case I think the two runs were
repeated here and it was still a whole period of 10 or 12 years
between the discovery of the element and it being finally
named. Because people want to be absolutely sure that the
data are correct. The machines that makes these ions is enormous
and it takes a whole team of operators to control it. And
all this stuff behind me is to control the power, the voltages
and so on, and the different parts of the accelerator
that takes the ion beam to this tiny chamber. It is really only
about this size, where the actual experiment took place and
once the atom is made it then flies off to the detector that
is two rooms away down a long tube. Yeah, of course we are waiting now for the
final confirmation to christen element 112 which is going to
be copernicium, but well we don’t know yet what we are going
to do for the christening. We are having discussions what
we are going to do and I think it will be a big surprise.

**Transcript**:
So copernicium, or copernicium as the discoverers
would prefer it to be pronounced, is the latest
name to go up on the periodic table and it is really very exciting
because it is the first time in as many years that a new name
has appeared. And not only has it appeared but quite excitingly,
it has appeared with a bit of controversy - what
should the symbol be? The first suggestion was that it should
be called, the symbol should be Cp, capital C with little
p and that has got really quite an argument inorganic chemists
who use organic groups in their compounds got quite excited
because Cp is the symbol that is used for cyclopentadienyl
ion which binds to all sorts of different metals and then
it was discovered or realised that, many, many years ago, Cp was
used as an alternative symbol for element number 71,
lutetium, which in some countries we called cassiopeium. And
I’ve looked in lots and lots of books that I have got at home
and I can’t find one of them that uses this name, but the reason
why it is important is because now more and more old
papers, old books are being digitised on the internet,
if you start searching for the symbol Cp it will start
throwing up old papers and cause confusion. So the decision
has been made by the International Union of Pure and Applied
Chemistry or the recommendation is that the symbol should
be Cn, capital C, little n. And I think that this is a very
sensible suggestion because it is unlikely that it can be confused
with cyanide which is capital C, capital N. And it is also
nice for our Chinese colleagues because Cn is the domain name for
Chinese websites and I think most chemists will be
very happy with that. The element itself was first made quite a
few years ago, and it’s made like all these heavy elements
by taking the nuclei of two atoms that are lighter and banging them
together and if you are aiming for element 112 then you need
to take 2 nuclei, which have atomic numbers which when
you add them together come up to 112, so in this case you
take lead which is atomic number 82 and so to get from 82
to 112 you need to add 30, so you accelerate zinc atoms which
have atomic number of 30 towards these in a high speed
accelerator and every so often, and quite rarely, these two
nuclei fuse together to give you an element or an atom
of element 112. When you make the atom, it exists, for a short
time which might be a thousandth of a second, or a few
thousandths of a second or it might be as long as half a second
or even a second. And then the nucleus of the atom starts
to decay. Now it doesn’t blow into parts which are
just protons and neutrons in one great whoosh! But instead
it starts going down by steps, usually the atomic number changes
by two units or one unit depending what sort of particle
is ejected from the nucleus. So in the case of 112, and
I don’t know the details yet, it will decay. For example, the
first step may be going from 112 to 110 then the second step
may be just one unit to 109, and then two down to 107 and
so on. Until you get to an element below the mass of uranium
the mass of 92 - which is stable.

**Transcript**:
Elementor 116 was named at the same time as element 114 116 has the name livermorium after the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the United States is quite surprising than element discovered in Russia should be given a name after a town or a lab in the United States but there's a really good reason as you've probably seen as demonstrating several times already that you make super-heavy elements by taking the nucleus of a heavy element and the nucleus of a lighter one and banging them together and eventually they stick so you have the lighter one incorporated in the nucleus of the heavy one and in the case of element 116 the light element was calcium which is element number 20 so the heavy one has to be element number 96 and 96 is one of the transuranium synthetic elements curium named after madame curie it is an element that does not occur naturally but it differs from elements like 116 where only a few atoms have been made because you can make a small lump of curium not you can't make tons of it but you can make some of it they're made in nuclear reactors by bombardment of one element after another I think it's probably made by Neutron bombardment of plutonium and then a lot of purification and in this particular case the curium for the experiment was made in America and flown to Russia where they did the experiment so it really was international collaboration and therefore in honor of this the Russian and US teams who combined together decided to call it livermorium that seems very generous to me professor that that feels like someone winning car race and then sharing the trophy with the person that fueled up their car no it's like somebody winning a car race and sharing a prize with a car designer so without the curiam there'd be no element 116 so I think it's quite fair what's more it all knows the lab rather than the name of the person as I mentioned in the earlier video the Lawrence Livermore Lab was originally an atomic weapons laboratory founded at the height of the Cold War when Russia and the United States were almost at war and were enemies and therefore this is really a very good symbol of peace nobody knows what the chemistry of element 116 would be like it will be like the chemistry of polonium and polonium itself is a highly radioactive element so chemists like me don't really know much about the chemistry of polonium I suspect that as most elements are metallic at the bottom of the periodic table that element 116 if you could get another atoms all together at the same time would also be metallic but like the other elements at this part of the periodic table the real importance of element 116 is to study how it decays and for physicists to understand the forces that hold together these really large nuclei in some ways I think it is easier to understand these forces than with the more conventional elements like sodium where everything is held so tightly that you can't easily watch them decay when you talk about this do you feel you're talking chemistry are talking physics I suppose in some ways I'm talking physics but I'm a chemist so I'm not sure if chemists can talk physics and it is part of our periodic table and by our I don't mean chemists but I mean everybody's periodic table and even chemists need to know how these elements are synthesized and why they're important can I ask you a question would you rather have an element named after you or win a Nobel Prize well I think that's that's a very interesting question and probably completely theoretical and I'm not really at erudition however I think it would be a bit unfair to have an element named after oneself if you hadn't actually done some work towards it I'm a Seaborg discovered elements Meitner all these other people and Copernicus didn't elements hadn't been discovered but he was a great scientist anyway but in general I think if it is going to be a name of a modern scientist it has to be the name of somebody that's made a real contribution to this area of science just like I would feel a complete fraud if somebody named a mountain after me unless I claim being the first person to climb to the top and he is one final little fact that even the professor didn't know when we were making this video and that is that Livermore in California was actually formally known as Nottingham and of course for those of you who don't know will see the logos at the end of all their videos our films are actually based at the School of Chemistry at the University of Nottingham so who knows maybe if they'd stuck with that original name the lab would have been called the Lawrence Nottingham labs and we'd be making a video today about Nottingham making it onto the periodic table but of course that didn't happen and we've got livermorium

Elementor 116 was named at the same time as element 114 116 has the name livermorium after the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the United States is quite surprising than element discovered in Russia should be given a name after a town or a lab in the United States but there's a really good reason as you've probably seen as demonstrating several times already that you make super-heavy elements by taking the nucleus of a heavy element and the nucleus of a lighter one and banging them together and eventually they stick so you have the lighter one incorporated in the nucleus of the heavy one and in the case of element 116 the light element was calcium which is element number 20 so the heavy one has to be element number 96 and 96 is one of the transuranium synthetic elements curium named after madame curie it is an element that does not occur naturally but it differs from elements like 116 where only a few atoms have been made because you can make a small lump of curium not you can't make tons of it but you can make some of it they're made in nuclear reactors by bombardment of one element after another I think it's probably made by Neutron bombardment of plutonium and then a lot of purification and in this particular case the curium for the experiment was made in America and flown to Russia where they did the experiment so it really was international collaboration and therefore in honor of this the Russian and US teams who combined together decided to call it livermorium that seems very generous to me professor that that feels like someone winning car race and then sharing the trophy with the person that fueled up their car no it's like somebody winning a car race and sharing a prize with a car designer so without the curiam there'd be no element 116 so I think it's quite fair what's more it all knows the lab rather than the name of the person as I mentioned in the earlier video the Lawrence Livermore Lab was originally an atomic weapons laboratory founded at the height of the Cold War when Russia and the United States were almost at war and were enemies and therefore this is really a very good symbol of peace nobody knows what the chemistry of element 116 would be like it will be like the chemistry of polonium and polonium itself is a highly radioactive element so chemists like me don't really know much about the chemistry of polonium I suspect that as most elements are metallic at the bottom of the periodic table that element 116 if you could get another atoms all together at the same time would also be metallic but like the other elements at this part of the periodic table the real importance of element 116 is to study how it decays and for physicists to understand the forces that hold together these really large nuclei in some ways I think it is easier to understand these forces than with the more conventional elements like sodium where everything is held so tightly that you can't easily watch them decay when you talk about this do you feel you're talking chemistry are talking physics I suppose in some ways I'm talking physics but I'm a chemist so I'm not sure if chemists can talk physics and it is part of our periodic table and by our I don't mean chemists but I mean everybody's periodic table and even chemists need to know how these elements are synthesized and why they're important can I ask you a question would you rather have an element named after you or win a Nobel Prize well I think that's that's a very interesting question and probably completely theoretical and I'm not really at erudition however I think it would be a bit unfair to have an element named after oneself if you hadn't actually done some work towards it I'm a Seaborg discovered elements Meitner all these other people and Copernicus didn't elements hadn't been discovered but he was a great scientist anyway but in general I think if it is going to be a name of a modern scientist it has to be the name of somebody that's made a real contribution to this area of science just like I would feel a complete fraud if somebody named a mountain after me unless I claim being the first person to climb to the top and he is one final little fact that even the professor didn't know when we were making this video and that is that Livermore in California was actually formally known as Nottingham and of course for those of you who don't know will see the logos at the end of all their videos our films are actually based at the School of Chemistry at the University of Nottingham so who knows maybe if they'd stuck with that original name the lab would have been called the Lawrence Nottingham labs and we'd be making a video today about Nottingham making it onto the periodic table but of course that didn't happen and we've got livermorium

Transcriber: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal They're long and slithery, and they're not very colorful. But they do have a strange beauty of their own. Their sinuous, nocturnal movements through the water are mesmerizing to watch. And though they may resemble underwater snakes, eels are, in fact, a very interesting type of fish. There are several things about eels that make them unique besides their elongated shape and limbless bodies. For one thing, eels have the ability to breathe through their skin. Some can even leave the water and move over land for short periods. And, unlike most migratory fish, such as salmon, which spawn in fresh water but live their adult lives in salt water, eels of the genus Anguilla migrate in the opposite direction, spawning and breeding in oceans and seas, while spending most of their intervening time in fresh water. If we were to take one such fresh water eel and follow its life story, it would be born in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, about a thousand miles east of Bermuda. This area, called the Sargasso Sea, forms the western part of a subtropical gyre, a giant whirlpool in the middle of the ocean. Our eel, let's call it Eli, would begin as one of ten to twenty million tiny eggs, carried by a female eel, hatching into a transparent leaf-shaped thing that looks nothing like an adult eel. Eli starts to drift in ocean currents, predominantly the Gulf Stream towards either Europe or North America, depending on its particular species. Upon reaching the coast, Eli is about two inches long, looking more eely but still transparent, known at this stage as a glass eel. But within a couple of days in fresh water, Eli's skin becomes pigmented a brownish-black, now looking more like that of an adult eel. You might notice that we haven't mentioned anything about Eli's gender yet. That's because this is only determined once an eel enters fresh water, though nobody is sure exactly how that happens. Most of the eels that stay in the estuaries and brackish water become males, while those that go upstream become females, growing up to two to three times bigger than their future mates. In this case, it turns out that Eli was actually short for Elaine. As a female eel, Elaine will be quite solitary for most of her life in the stream, eating whatever falls in the water: grasshoppers, crickets, small fish, insect larvae, frogs, baby birds, almost anything she can get her mouth around. And she will grow quite big, up to four feet long and weighing as much as thirteen pounds. We don't know exactly how fresh water eels know when it's time to return to the ocean, but something calls to them. And their fall migration is one of the largest unseen migrations on the planet. As Elaine leaves fresh water for the ocean, she undergoes a shocking metamorphosis. Her eyes enlarge by about ten times, her skin gets thicker, and her fins get larger. These are most likely adaptations for their upcoming ocean travel, and Elaine seamlessly makes the transition from fresh to salt water, which would be toxic for most other fish. Once Elaine leaves the mouth of the fresh water streams, she will disappear completely from human view. No one has witnessed, or been able to follow, an adult eel on their migration, nor do we know how deep they spawn. But it's assumed that they can follow some signs that they can detect, such as a thermal barrier between ocean currents or a salinity front, in order to return to the same area of the ocean where they were born. Because we don't even know exactly what happens during an eel's migration, we can only imagine what the actual breeding looks like. But the common hypothesis is that Elaine and thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of other eels gather in large, intertwined masses and release their eggs and sperm in a giant orgy known as panmixia. A couple of days after the eggs are laid, they hatch, and the cycle begins again. And because we've never seen the adult eels returning up the fresh water rivers, we must assume that, having completed their long and roundabout journey, these amazing and mysterious creatures finally die there, in the same place where they were born. Goodbye, Elaine! It was a pleasure knowing you.

Transcriber: Jessica Ruby
Reviewer: Caroline Cristal They're long and slithery, and they're not very colorful. But they do have a strange beauty of their own. Their sinuous, nocturnal movements through the water are mesmerizing to watch. And though they may resemble underwater snakes, eels are, in fact, a very interesting type of fish. There are several things about eels that make them unique besides their elongated shape and limbless bodies. For one thing, eels have the ability to breathe through their skin. Some can even leave the water and move over land for short periods. And, unlike most migratory fish, such as salmon, which spawn in fresh water but live their adult lives in salt water, eels of the genus Anguilla migrate in the opposite direction, spawning and breeding in oceans and seas, while spending most of their intervening time in fresh water. If we were to take one such fresh water eel and follow its life story, it would be born in the middle of the North Atlantic Ocean, about a thousand miles east of Bermuda. This area, called the Sargasso Sea, forms the western part of a subtropical gyre, a giant whirlpool in the middle of the ocean. Our eel, let's call it Eli, would begin as one of ten to twenty million tiny eggs, carried by a female eel, hatching into a transparent leaf-shaped thing that looks nothing like an adult eel. Eli starts to drift in ocean currents, predominantly the Gulf Stream towards either Europe or North America, depending on its particular species. Upon reaching the coast, Eli is about two inches long, looking more eely but still transparent, known at this stage as a glass eel. But within a couple of days in fresh water, Eli's skin becomes pigmented a brownish-black, now looking more like that of an adult eel. You might notice that we haven't mentioned anything about Eli's gender yet. That's because this is only determined once an eel enters fresh water, though nobody is sure exactly how that happens. Most of the eels that stay in the estuaries and brackish water become males, while those that go upstream become females, growing up to two to three times bigger than their future mates. In this case, it turns out that Eli was actually short for Elaine. As a female eel, Elaine will be quite solitary for most of her life in the stream, eating whatever falls in the water: grasshoppers, crickets, small fish, insect larvae, frogs, baby birds, almost anything she can get her mouth around. And she will grow quite big, up to four feet long and weighing as much as thirteen pounds. We don't know exactly how fresh water eels know when it's time to return to the ocean, but something calls to them. And their fall migration is one of the largest unseen migrations on the planet. As Elaine leaves fresh water for the ocean, she undergoes a shocking metamorphosis. Her eyes enlarge by about ten times, her skin gets thicker, and her fins get larger. These are most likely adaptations for their upcoming ocean travel, and Elaine seamlessly makes the transition from fresh to salt water, which would be toxic for most other fish. Once Elaine leaves the mouth of the fresh water streams, she will disappear completely from human view. No one has witnessed, or been able to follow, an adult eel on their migration, nor do we know how deep they spawn. But it's assumed that they can follow some signs that they can detect, such as a thermal barrier between ocean currents or a salinity front, in order to return to the same area of the ocean where they were born. Because we don't even know exactly what happens during an eel's migration, we can only imagine what the actual breeding looks like. But the common hypothesis is that Elaine and thousands, or hundreds of thousands, of other eels gather in large, intertwined masses and release their eggs and sperm in a giant orgy known as panmixia. A couple of days after the eggs are laid, they hatch, and the cycle begins again. And because we've never seen the adult eels returning up the fresh water rivers, we must assume that, having completed their long and roundabout journey, these amazing and mysterious creatures finally die there, in the same place where they were born. Goodbye, Elaine! It was a pleasure knowing you.

**Transcript**:
first a video yes it is a scrambled egg but as you look at it I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is on scrambling itself and you will now see the yolk and the white have separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet look around us what we see around us is staggering complexity Eric pine hotter estimates that in New York City alone there are some 10 billion skews or distinct commodities being traded that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth and they're being traded by a species of almost 7 billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity so here's a great puzzle in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty in pockets there appear what my colleague Fred's vehicle's Goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create complexity now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility and that's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have to do something that may at first sight seemed completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe so let's do it let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years to the beginning of time around us there's nothing there's not even time or space imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly BAM a universe appears and the entire universe and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it's smaller than an atom it's incredibly hot it contains everything that's in today's universe so we can imagine it's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed and at first it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that happens in the first second now we move forward 380,000 years that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium now I want to pause for a moment 380,000 years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush but that's not completely true recent studies by satellites such as the W map satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff so where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center of each cloud the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of energy and bam we have our first stars from about 200 million years after the Big Bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing to new thresholds when very large stars die they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion so now the universe is chemically more complex and in the chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things and that starts happening is that around young sons young stars all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form the particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion years ago rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity now the going gets tougher the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity I'm talking of course about living organisms living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge Edge's of chemicals so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales and gravity which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry what are the Goldilocks conditions well the first you need energy but not too much in the center of the star there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little in intergalactic space there's so little energy that atoms can't combine what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars but not too close you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water why well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up in solids atoms stuck together they can't move in liquids they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules now where do you find such Goldilocks conditions well planets are great and our early Earth was almost perfect it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep beneath those oceans that cracks in the earth crust you got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations but of course life is more than just exotic chemistry how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick you don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template the thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and DNA of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA each rung contains information so DNA contains information about how to make living organisms and DNA also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story the real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion runs there tends to be an error and what that means is that DNA is in effect learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work so DNA is learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity then from about 600 to 800 million years ago multi-celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish you get plants you get and figure you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs and occasionally there are disasters 65 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the Yucatan Peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs were wiped out terrible news for the dinosaurs but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in lanisha's left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid humans appeared about 200,000 years ago and I believe we count as a threshold in this great story let me explain why we've seen that DNA learns in a sense it accumulates information but it is so slow DNA accumulates information through random errors that just some of which just happened to work but DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn in real time they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die the information dies with them now what makes humans different is human language we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory and that means it can outlast the individuals who learnt that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that's why as a species we are so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift I call this ability collective learning it's what makes us different we can see that work in the earliest stages of human history we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia tough tough environment into the Americas into Australasia each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways of dealing with their surroundings then 10,000 years ago exploiting a sudden change in global climates with the end of the last ice age humans learnt to farm farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected and then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through Telegraph through the Internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost 7 billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed and then the last 200 years something else has happened we've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels so fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us so here we are back at the convention center we've been on a journey a return journey 13.7 billion years I hope you agree this is a powerful story and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings collective learning is a very very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England living through the Cuban Missile Crisis for a few days the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction and the same weapons are still here and they're still armed if we avoid that trap others are waiting for us we're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seemed to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning and now finally this is what I want I want my grandson Daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us and that's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet I thank you for your attention

can't combine what you want is just the right amount and planets it turns out are just right because they're close to stars but not too close you also need a great diversity of chemical elements and you need liquids such as water why well in gases atoms move past each other so fast that they can't hitch up in solids atoms stuck together they can't move in liquids they can cruise and cuddle and link up to form molecules now where do you find such Goldilocks conditions well planets are great and our early Earth was almost perfect it was just the right distance from its star to contain huge oceans of liquid water and deep beneath those oceans that cracks in the earth crust you got heat seeping up from inside the earth and you've got a great diversity of elements so at those deep oceanic vents fantastic chemistry began to happen and atoms combined in all sorts of exotic combinations but of course life is more than just exotic chemistry how do you stabilize those huge molecules that seem to be viable well it's here that life introduces an entirely new trick you don't stabilize the individual you stabilize the template the thing that carries information and you allow the template to copy itself and DNA of course is the beautiful molecule that contains that information you'll be familiar with the double helix of DNA each rung contains information so DNA contains information about how to make living organisms and DNA also copies itself so it copies itself and scatters the templates through the ocean so the information spreads notice that information has become part of our story the real beauty of DNA though is in its imperfections as it copies itself once in every billion runs there tends to be an error and what that means is that DNA is in effect learning it's accumulating new ways of making living organisms because some of those errors work so DNA is learning and it's building greater diversity and greater complexity and we can see this happening over the last four billion years for most of that time of life on earth living organisms have been relatively simple single cells but they had great diversity and inside great complexity then from about 600 to 800 million years ago multi-celled organisms appear you get fungi you get fish you get plants you get and figure you get reptiles and then of course you get the dinosaurs and occasionally there are disasters 65 million years ago an asteroid landed on earth near the Yucatan Peninsula creating conditions equivalent to those of a nuclear war and the dinosaurs were wiped out terrible news for the dinosaurs but great news for our mammalian ancestors who flourished in lanisha's left empty by the dinosaurs and we human beings are part of that creative evolutionary pulse that began 65 million years ago with the landing of an asteroid humans appeared about 200,000 years ago and I believe we count as a threshold in this great story let me explain why we've seen that DNA learns in a sense it accumulates information but it is so slow DNA accumulates information through random errors that just some of which just happened to work but DNA had actually generated a faster way of learning it had produced organisms with brains and those organisms can learn in real time they accumulate information they learn the sad thing is when they die the information dies with them now what makes humans different is human language we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory and that means it can outlast the individuals who learnt that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that's why as a species we are so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift I call this ability collective learning it's what makes us different we can see that work in the earliest stages of human history we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia tough tough environment into the Americas into Australasia each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways of dealing with their surroundings then 10,000 years ago exploiting a sudden change in global climates with the end of the last ice age humans learnt to farm farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected and then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through Telegraph through the Internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost 7 billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed and then the last 200 years something else has happened we've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels so fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us so here we are back at the convention center we've been on a journey a return journey 13.7 billion years I hope you agree this is a powerful story and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings collective learning is a very very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England living through the Cuban Missile Crisis for a few days the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction and the same weapons are still here and they're still armed if we avoid that trap others are waiting for us we're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seemed to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning and now finally this is what I want I want my grandson Daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us and that's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet I thank you for your attention

**Transcript**:
first a video yes it is a scrambled egg but as you look at it I hope you'll begin to feel just slightly uneasy because you may notice that what's actually happening is that the egg is on scrambling itself and you will now see the yolk and the white have separated and now they're going to be poured back into the egg and we all know in our heart of hearts that this is not the way the universe works a scrambled egg is mush tasty mush but it's mush an egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing that can create even more sophisticated things such as chickens and we know in our heart of hearts that the universe does not travel from mush to complexity in fact this gut instinct is reflected in one of the most fundamental laws of physics the second law of thermodynamics or the law of entropy what that says basically is that the general tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order lack of structure in fact to mush and that's why that video feels a bit strange and yet look around us what we see around us is staggering complexity Eric pine hotter estimates that in New York City alone there are some 10 billion skews or distinct commodities being traded that's hundreds of times as many species as there are on earth and they're being traded by a species of almost 7 billion individuals who are linked by trade travel and the internet into a global system of stupendous complexity so here's a great puzzle in a universe ruled by the second law of thermodynamics how is it possible to generate the sort of complexity I've described the sort of complexity represented by you and me and the convention center well the answer seems to be the universe can create complexity but with great difficulty in pockets there appear what my colleague Fred's vehicle's Goldilocks conditions not too hot not too cold just right for the creation of complexity and slightly more complex things appear and where you have slightly more complex things you can get slightly more complex things and in this way complexity builds stage by stage each stage is magical because it creates the impression of something utterly new appearing almost out of nowhere in the universe we refer in big history to these moments as threshold moments and at each threshold the going gets tougher the complex things get more fragile more vulnerable the Goldilocks conditions get more stringent and it's more difficult to create complexity now we as extremely complex creatures desperately need to know this story of how the universe creates complexity despite the second law and why complexity means vulnerability and fragility and that's the story that we tell in big history but to do it you have to do something that may at first sight seemed completely impossible you have to survey the whole history of the universe so let's do it let's begin by winding the timeline back 13.7 billion years to the beginning of time around us there's nothing there's not even time or space imagine the darkest emptiest thing you can and cube it a gazillion times and that's where we are and then suddenly BAM a universe appears and the entire universe and we've crossed our first threshold the universe is tiny it's smaller than an atom it's incredibly hot it contains everything that's in today's universe so we can imagine it's busting and it's expanding at incredible speed and at first it's just a blur but very quickly distinct things begin to appear in that blur within the first second energy itself shatters into distinct forces including electromagnetism and gravity and energy does something else quite magical it congeals to form matter quarks that will create protons and leptons that include electrons and all of that happens in the first second now we move forward 380,000 years that's twice as long as humans have been on this planet and now simple atoms appear of hydrogen and helium now I want to pause for a moment 380,000 years after the origins of the universe because we actually know quite a lot about the universe at this stage we know above all that it was extremely simple it consisted of huge clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms and they have no structure they're really a sort of cosmic mush but that's not completely true recent studies by satellites such as the W map satellite have shown that in fact there are just tiny differences in that background what you see here the blue areas are about a thousandth of a degree cooler than the red areas these are tiny differences but it was enough for the universe to move on to the next stage of building complexity and this is how it works gravity is more powerful where there's more stuff so where you get slightly denser areas gravity starts compacting clouds of hydrogen and helium atoms so we can imagine the early universe breaking up into a billion and each cloud is compacted gravity gets more powerful as density increases the temperature begins to rise at the center of each cloud and then at the center of each cloud the temperature crosses the threshold temperature of 10 million degrees protons start to fuse there's a huge release of energy and bam we have our first stars from about 200 million years after the Big Bang stars begin to appear all through the universe billions of them and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex stars will create the Goldilocks conditions for crossing to new thresholds when very large stars die they create temperatures so high that protons begin to fuse in all sorts of exotic combinations to form all the elements of the periodic table if like me you're wearing a gold ring it was forged in a supernova explosion so now the universe is chemically more complex and in the chemically more complex universe it's possible to make more things and that starts happening is that around young sons young stars all these elements combine they swirl around the energy of the star stirs them around they form the particles they form snowflakes they form little dust motes they form rocks they form asteroids and eventually they form planets and moons and that is how our solar system was formed four and a half billion years ago rocky planets like our earth are significantly more complex than stars because they contain a much greater diversity of materials so we've crossed a fourth threshold of complexity now the going gets tougher the next stage introduces entities that are significantly more fragile significantly more vulnerable but they're also much more creative and much more capable of generating further complexity I'm talking of course about living organisms living organisms are created by chemistry we are huge Edge's of chemicals so chemistry is dominated by the electromagnetic force that operates over smaller scales and gravity which explains why you and I are smaller than stars or planets now what are the ideal conditions for chemistry what are the Goldilocks conditions well the first you need energy but not too much in the center of the star there's so much energy that any atoms that combine will just get busted apart again but not too little in intergalactic space there's so little energy that atoms

different is human language we are blessed with a language a system of communication so powerful and so precise that we can share what we've learned with such precision that it can accumulate in the collective memory and that means it can outlast the individuals who learnt that information and it can accumulate from generation to generation and that's why as a species we are so creative and so powerful and that's why we have a history we seem to be the only species in four billion years to have this gift I call this ability collective learning it's what makes us different we can see that work in the earliest stages of human history we evolved as a species in the savanna lands of Africa but then you see humans migrating into new environments into desert lands into jungles into the Ice Age tundra of Siberia tough tough environment into the Americas into Australasia each migration involved learning learning new ways of exploiting the environment new ways of dealing with their surroundings then 10,000 years ago exploiting a sudden change in global climates with the end of the last ice age humans learnt to farm farming was an energy bonanza and exploiting that energy human populations multiplied human societies got larger denser more interconnected and then from about 500 years ago humans began to link up globally through shipping through trains through Telegraph through the Internet until now we seem to form a single global brain of almost 7 billion individuals and that brain is learning at warp speed and then the last 200 years something else has happened we've stumbled on another energy bonanza in fossil fuels so fossil fuels and collective learning together explain the staggering complexity we see around us so here we are back at the convention center we've been on a journey a return journey 13.7 billion years I hope you agree this is a powerful story and it's a story in which humans play an astonishing and creative role but it also contains warnings collective learning is a very very powerful force and it's not clear that we humans are in charge of it I remember very vividly as a child growing up in England living through the Cuban Missile Crisis for a few days the entire biosphere seemed to be on the verge of destruction and the same weapons are still here and they're still armed if we avoid that trap others are waiting for us we're burning fossil fuels at such a rate that we seemed to be undermining the Goldilocks conditions that made it possible for human civilizations to flourish over the last 10,000 years so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us but it can also show us our power with collective learning and now finally this is what I want I want my grandson Daniel and his friends and his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history and to know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the opportunities that face us and that's why a group of us are building a free online syllabus in big history for high school students throughout the world we believe that big history will be a vital intellectual tool for them as Daniel and his generation face the huge challenges and also the huge opportunities ahead of them at this threshold moment in the history of our beautiful planet I thank you for your attention

**Transcript**:
I've always collected baseball cards. I first started playing baseball
when I was eight years old, and when my hometown,
Red Sox won the World Series in 2004, I began meeting many of the players at autograph signings
and events around Boston. But I noticed a few things in common. These players weren't very friendly,
they were all quite overpaid and they acted more like celebrities. In middle school, a friend introduced me
to a new way to collect autographs: writing the players through the mail. In doing so, I would write a letter,
send a self-addressed stamped envelope, and send a few baseball cards. Within a few weeks,
I'd often get a response. But it was never the modern players
that would send back. It was always the players
from the 50s and 60s, who were much friendlier, and much less recognized
during their career. So, I continued to write letters
to these retired ball players, and in 2007, Topps Baseball Cards
came out with a set where they included
a few Negro league baseball player cards. Negro league was a period
from 1920 to the 1960s where blacks who were segregated
from playing in the Major Leagues played in their own baseball league, often busing around the country,
playing two to three games a day, under much less glamorous conditions. But over time, due to the lack of glamorization
and public interest, everything just kind of faded away, leaving the history
of the Negro leagues behind. So, I ended up writing
to these players in this set and within a few weeks,
they signed my cards. From here, I began writing
to Negro leaguers who didn't have baseball cards. Guys that were, you know,
even less recognized. And in my letters,
I'd often include my phone number, and a few of them
began reaching out to me. When I started speaking with them, I noticed they all had
a few things in common. None of them had baseball cards,
none of them had any documentation, no newspaper articles,
no sorts of photos from their career, just nothing tying them to the game. And lastly, they had just left
all their teammates behind. They hadn't stayed in touch
with any of their teammates. So, I tried to change this, and I started off by making
baseball cards on my home computer. Printing them out, designing them
and sending them to ball players. And what I also did is I began
signing up for newspaper archive websites where I'd find old newspaper articles that would give these guys the recognition
that, you know, tied them to the game. And lastly, I began becoming
kind of like a private investigator, tracking down their former teammates and trying to get these guys
back in touch. From here, I went on
and I just spoke to these players. It got to the point where I actually
had players calling me up, asking me for information. And by the time
I was a freshman in high school, it was no longer a hobby at all. I had gone from an autograph collector
to this Negro league research obsession. I even asked for Negro league autographs
and stamps for Christmas. So, going on through high school, I began to take this work
in the Negro league much more seriously. I started working
with adult Negro league researchers where I began working
on a few different programs. The first being
the Negro League Annual Reunion in Birmingham, Alabama. At the reunion, we'd have
about 50 to 60 Negro league ball players from around the country, and they'd all come together, and these players would just,
you know, sit in the hotel lobby for me from 8am until the late hours of the night just catching up, telling stories, and here we just had a week of events and these guys got some
of this recognition and honor that they never really had before. The second program that I began working on
was the Negro League Pension Program. And the Pension Program was a program
that was offered by Major League Baseball, and if you played four years
in the Negro league, and you can document it, these players would be entitled
to 10,000 dollars a year. This meant a lot for these players. Many of these guys
never really did much after baseball, they didn't make much money. So, when I was able
to get these players pensions, it really made a difference. When I started doing this,
I encountered a lot of difficulty. I had to go through hundreds and hundreds
of newspaper articles trying to find this documentation
to prove they played, and in many cases I did. Also I want to mention, when I was speaking
with these players on the phone, tracking them down, it wasn't easy either. I would go through hundreds of articles trying to look for names,
find information, and I encountered quite a lot of failure. I would call people up,
it would be the wrong person. It would be really awkward. I'd also have a lot of times
where I'd call players up, and they didn't want
to speak at all to me. They would hang up. When I said the word baseball,
they would just refuse to talk altogether. This was because they faced
a lot of segregation during their careers. Along with the lack
of glamorization that they faced, they also dealt with a lot of racism
on and off the baseball field, which just lasted with them
throughout their whole lives. These guys, you know, it was very emotional for them
to talk about baseball, and it was really hard
to kind of get these guys back, you know, talking about this game
that they had kind of left behind. Lastly though, I encountered, you know,
quite a lot of success as well. Some of these guys I'd call up,
I'd talk to them for two to three hours, and these guys would just
go on and on about their stories, telling me, like, exact baseball games
and memories that they had. Nowadays, I've attended
four Negro League Reunions, three of which I've actually roomed
with former Negro league ball player Russell "Crazy Legs" Patterson
of the Indianapolis Clowns. He actually snores at night,
in case you all were wondering. I've worked on about a dozen pensions and I've tracked down over a hundred
Negro league ball players, constantly finding new ball players, getting them in touch
with their former teammates, bringing baseball back
into these players' lives and bringing these guys
back into the game. (Music) Thank you! (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Take a look out your window, put on your glasses if you wear them. You might want to grab a pair of binoculars, too, or a magnifying lens. Now, what do you see? Well, whatever it is, it's not the multiple layers of glass right in front of you. But have you ever wondered how something so solid can be so invisible? To understand that, we have to understand what glass actually is, and where it comes from. It all begins in the Earth's crust, where the two most common elements are silicon and oxygen. These react together to form silicon dioxide, whose molecules arrange themselves into a regular crystalline form known as quartz. Quartz is commonly found in sand, where it often makes up most of the grains and is the main ingredient in most type of glass. Of course, you probably noticed that glass isn't made of multiple tiny bits of quartz, and for good reason. For one thing, the edges of the rigidly formed grains and smaller defects within the crystal structure reflect and disperse light that hits them. But when the quartz is heated high enough the extra energy makes the molecules vibrate until they break the bonds holding them together and become a flowing liquid, the same way that ice melts into water. Unlike water, though, liquid silicon dioxide does not reform into a crystal solid when it cools. Instead, as the molecules lose energy, they are less and less able to move into an ordered position, and the result is what is called an amorphous solid. A solid material with the chaotic structure of a liquid, which allows the molecules to freely fill in any gaps. This makes the surface of glass uniform on a microscopic level, allowing light to strike it without being scattered in different directions. But this still doesn't explain why light is able to pass through glass rather than being absorbed as with most solids. For that, we need to go all the way down to the subatomic level. You may know that an atom consists of a nucleus with electrons orbiting around it, but you may be surprised to know that it's mostly empty space. In fact, if an atom were the size of a sports stadium, the nucleus would be like a single pea in the center, while the electrons would be like grains of sand in the outer seats. That should leave plenty of space for light to pass through without hitting any of these particles. So the real question is not why is glass transparent, but why aren't all materials transparent? The answer has to do with the different energy levels that electrons in an atom can have. Think of these as different rows of seats in the stadium stands. An electron is initially assigned to sit in a certain row, but it could jump to a better row, if it only had the energy. As luck would have it, absorbing one of those light photons passing through the atom can provide just the energy the electron needs. But there's a catch. The energy from the photon has to be the right amount to get an electron to the next row. Otherwise, it will just let the photon pass by, and it just so happens that in glass, the rows are so far apart that a photon of visible light can't provide enough energy for an electron to jump between them. Photons from ultraviolet light, on the other hand, give just the right amount of energy, and are absorbed, which is why you can't get a suntan through glass. This amazing property of being both solid and transparent has given glass many uses throughout the centuries. From windows that let in light while keeping out the elements, to lenses that allow us to see both the vast worlds beyond our planet, and the tiny ones right around us. It is hard to imagine modern civilization without glass. And yet for such an important material we rarely think about glass and its impact. It is precisely because the most important and useful quality of glass is being featureless and invisible that we often forget that it's even there.

**Transcript**:
Europium is an element which, when you excite
the atoms or excite the electrons in the atoms, gives out very nice
red coloured light. Ok, so europium is pretty much in the middle
of the lanthanide series. Perhaps its most famous use is in television
screens. In fact, most or many of the rare earths can
fluoresce in this way and give out light, but europium is particularly
good at giving a very nice red colour, and so europium salts are used in
television screens, not LCD screens like you have on the laptop, but the
old-fashioned cathode ray televisions. So it’s very good at phosphorescence, for
example, so we use it in the tubes in TV screens to get different colours. The screen on the inside of the screen you
have dots of europium and when the electrons from the electron beam
in the cathode ray tube hit the europium you get a very intense emission
of red light which gives you the red colour to form the colour television
pictures.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In what kind of old-fashioned machines can you find europium?
Options: A. Radios, B. Cathode ray color TVs, C. Washing machines
Correct Option: B

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Europium is an element which, when you excite
the atoms or excite the electrons in the atoms, gives out very nice
red coloured light. Ok, so europium is pretty much in the middle
of the lanthanide series. Perhaps its most famous use is in television
screens. In fact, most or many of the rare earths can
fluoresce in this way and give out light, but europium is particularly
good at giving a very nice red colour, and so europium salts are used in
television screens, not LCD screens like you have on the laptop, but the
old-fashioned cathode ray televisions. So it’s very good at phosphorescence, for
example, so we use it in the tubes in TV screens to get different colours. The screen on the inside of the screen you
have dots of europium and when the electrons from the electron beam
in the cathode ray tube hit the europium you get a very intense emission
of red light which gives you the red colour to form the colour television
pictures.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Which color does europium emit when you excite the electrons in its atoms?
Options: A. Blue, B. Red, C. White
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is europium, according to the transcript?

**Transcript**:
Cerium is one of only two elements which,
if you strike it, will make sparks. One of them is iron and the other
one is cerium. And so I bought this when I was on holiday a year ago. I haven’t
had the chance to use it. It contains, it consists of a rod here
which claims to have several metals including cerium. Let’s see if it
sparks. Ok so cerium, element number 58, has some
bizarre uses, would you believe it’s used in self-cleaning ovens. So it’s not very easy to do but, once you
get the hang of it, it does go quite well. Cerium also has uses such for staining glass.
So if you want to stain your glass yellow then you could use cerium in
that. What is happening is that tiny pieces of cerium
are being knocked off and, in the air, they just burst into flames.
So, I think, the property is, not so much that it forms a spark, but that
you can knock off the right size lumps to make them burn. These things
that are being knocked off are probably just a few nanometres, that’s
a thousandth-millionth of a metre across so they’re very tiny size.
So then the surface area is high because it’s small so it has a large surface
compared to its volume. And so it reacts with oxygen very rapidly and
heats up and bursts into flame. The point about cerium is that very small
particles of cerium oxide are now becoming quite important in various areas
of technology. There’s a company, or several companies, that are using
nano particles of cerium oxide as an additive for fuels to make a particular
diesel fuel to try and make it burn better and give more power when
you are driving diesel cars. And here in Nottingham we are trying
to develop new ways of making these nano particles by reacting cerium
with high temperature water and it’s been quite successful. It’s also used in organic synthesis by chemists
for making organic molecules because it can be very reactive
under certain circumstances. Cerium is also used in permanent magnets for
obvious applications in magnetism.

So here you can see we have a very thin foil
sample of dysprosium. Again it is from the bottom
end of the periodic table, very, very reactive. Stored very, very carefully as a foil. Now
if we open, very carefully, we might see if the
metal is still there. Ok so dysprosium is used in nuclear fuel rods
because it is very good at capturing neutrons, which means that you can modulate how hot
a nuclear reaction is getting which is why it
is used in powerstations to prevent the reactions
from running away out of control. So take off all this foil and then we can
withdraw the sample. So it is in this really nice paper.
So is the sample still there? Oh beautiful, here
we see this wonderful sample of dysprosium. If you mix dysprosium with cadmium and sulphur
it can be used in devices which produce infrared beams. Now chemists use infrared beams quite
a lot because when you irradiate a sample, a
compound with infrared then certain absorbencies will occur which are specific
to stretching or bending modes which the molecule
will do. This is a way of, therefore, scanning molecules and getting information about their
composition and structure. Beautiful foil. Do you happen to know anything about this
element? Not a thing, that’s Steve’s domain. Yeah!

**Transcript**:
Ok so promethium is actually my least favourite
lanthanide because I can’t actually work with it. It’s highly
radioactive and at any one time on the earth’s surface there is not an awful
lot of it so you can’t physically get enough of it to do any chemistry with. So promethium is the only one of the rare
earth elements that is radioactive, but because it’s radioactive
and the atoms decay away it’s not found in nature. So it was only after
the start of nuclear research that people discovered promethium, even some
of the products from the decay from other radioactive elements. And
you can see this quite well: this is an old chemistry book that I’ve
got, written by Aston, the famous scientist who discovered isotopes – atoms
of the same element that have different weights - and in this book which
he published in 1922… Hold it a bit more vertical. Ok go ahead. …he had a periodic table and if you look
down here, here are the rare earths and in this position here there is
a space for element 61, promethium. So element 61 wasn’t known in
1922 and it was found much later. But you can see the rest of the
elements were, except there’s a gap down here under tungsten because,
again, the element rhenium was only discovered relatively recently
compared to most of the other elements.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The professor showed us an old chemistry book, written by Aston in 1922, without promethium in the periodic table. Which other element did he show was missing because it had yet to be discovered at that time?
Options: A. Gold, B. Rhenium, C. Livermorium
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the significance of the book written by Aston in 1922?
Options: A. It contains a comprehensive list of all elements, B. It includes a detailed description of the periodic table, C. It was one of the first books to mention the concept of isotopes, D. It features a periodic table with a gap for promethium
Correct Option: D

**Transcript**:
Lanthanum is the first element in a series
called the ‘rare earths’. They are not terribly rare but never-the-less they
are called rare earths and they all have rather similar names so there
is quite an amusing little rhyme, mnemonic, that people learn to remember
the names which at the first two letters of each word tell you
this chemical symbol the elements so this goes ‘Language Centres
Praise Ned’s Promise of Small European Garden Tubs. Dinosaurs Hobble Erotically
Thrumming Yellow Lutes’, which takes us from lanthanum all
the way to lutetium. Lanthanum is the largest of the lanthanides.
It’s a prototype for the lanthanide series and because it is the largest
it is the most reactive. It’s a strange metal in that you can actually cut
it with a knife. So it’s not actually that hard. I haven’t worked much with lanthanum but
one of my students or a Russian visitor did some rather interesting
experiments with making a compound of lanthanum and copper, so-called
lanthanum cuprate, which is quite an interesting catalyst. Lanthanum’s got quite a few technological
uses. It’s used in, of all things, lighting in Hollywood studios. Lanthanum can
also be used in hydrogen storage though obviously the hydrogen economy
is becoming a very important issue with the energy crisis and
so on and so forth; and it’s, in certain circumstances, it’s very effective
as what we called a hydrogen sponge so it can suck up all of the hydrogen
and then hopefully you could use it as a fuel source. But because
it’s quite heavy it might not be actually that useful in the end, but it’s
good to know that it can do that.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Regarding its reactivity, lanthanum is..
Options: A. The most reactive element of the lanthanides, B. As reactive as the other lanthanides, C. The least reactive element of the lanthanide
Correct Option: A

Indium is a very soft metal. I haven’t got
a sample here. It melts at 150 degrees or so. This is an example of indium it is a really,
really quite nice chemical element this one. We can use it for
lots and lots of selective types of catalysis, but generally
when it is forming a complex with other organic ligands. But here
we can see a really nice example of indium and this is
99.9% pure. But it’s a metal which has suddenly become
very much more expensive because its oxide is transparent
to light but will conduct electricity. So it is indium oxide
that you find on every LCD display. Here is a rather old computer
and here is an old fashioned computer, the LCD display
was quite small and gradually they have got bigger and bigger
and therefore demand for indium oxide is more and more and
probably you are watching this video clip through a thin
layer of indium oxide. This sample although it’s very small, is
5 grams. So it is a really, really, dense metal, very, very expensive
and very, very valuable as well. But indium is also used as solder for soldering
various metals together and it is also quite useful if, I
used it in my youth, when we were making low temperature apparatus
and we wanted to screw two things together and get
a nice seal in between them, you could screw them together
with a thin sheet of indium, and that almost welded them
together. So indium wire; it is very, very malleable
and very, very soft and very easy to form into shapes. I am not
going to touch it though because it will cause some significant
problems for me, because it does cause toxicity if it comes
into contact with the skin; so lovely piece of indium wire.

going to touch it though because it will cause some significant
problems for me, because it does cause toxicity if it comes

Indium is a very soft metal. I haven’t got
a sample here. It melts at 150 degrees or so. This is an example of indium it is a really,
really quite nice chemical element this one. We can use it for
lots and lots of selective types of catalysis, but generally
when it is forming a complex with other organic ligands. But here
we can see a really nice example of indium and this is
99.9% pure. But it’s a metal which has suddenly become
very much more expensive because its oxide is transparent
to light but will conduct electricity. So it is indium oxide
that you find on every LCD display. Here is a rather old computer
and here is an old fashioned computer, the LCD display
was quite small and gradually they have got bigger and bigger
and therefore demand for indium oxide is more and more and
probably you are watching this video clip through a thin
layer of indium oxide. This sample although it’s very small, is
5 grams. So it is a really, really, dense metal, very, very expensive
and very, very valuable as well. But indium is also used as solder for soldering
various metals together and it is also quite useful if, I
used it in my youth, when we were making low temperature apparatus
and we wanted to screw two things together and get
a nice seal in between them, you could screw them together
with a thin sheet of indium, and that almost welded them
together. So indium wire; it is very, very malleable
and very, very soft and very easy to form into shapes. I am not
going to touch it though because it will cause some significant
problems for me, because it does cause toxicity if it comes
into contact with the skin; so lovely piece of indium wire.

**Transcript**:
Once upon a time, South America lived harmoniously alongside Africa until a crack in the Earth drove the two continents apart. This breakup began about 200 million years ago during the separation of the supercontinent known as Pangaea. Their proximity back then explains why the same plant fossils and reptile fossils, like the Mesosaurus, can be found on the South American east coast and African west coast. However, this evidence does not account for how the continents moved apart. For that, we'll need to take a close look at the earth below our feet. Though you may not realize it, the ground below you is traveling across the Earth at a rate of about 10 cm/year, or the speed at which your fingernails grow. This is due to plate tectonics, or the large-scale movement of Earth's continents. The motion occurs within the top two layers of the Earth's mantle, the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The lithosphere, which includes the crust and uppermost mantle, comprises the land around you. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere the highly viscous but solid rock portion of the upper mantle. It's between 80 and 200 km below the Earth's surface. While the asthenosphere wraps around the Earth's core as one connected region, the lithosphere is separated on top into tectonic plates. There are seven primary tectonic plates that compose the shape of the planet we know today. Like the other smaller tectonic plates, the primary plates are about 100 km thick and are composed of one or two layers: continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust forms the continents and areas of shallow water close to their shores, whereas oceanic crust forms the ocean basins. The transition from the granitic continental crust to the basaltic oceanic crust occurs beyond the continentel shelf, in which the shore suddenly slopes down towards the ocean floor. The South American Plate is an example of a tectonic plate made of two crusts: the continent we know from today's map and a large region of the Atlantic Ocean around it. Collectively comprising the lithosphere, these plates are brittler and stiffer than the heated, malleable layer of the asthenosphere below. Because of this, the tectonic plates float on top of this layer, independently of one another. The speed and direction in which these tectonic plates move depends on the temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere below. Scientists are still trying to nail down the driving forces behind this movement, with some theories pointing towards mantle convection, while others are examining the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull. Though the mechanics have not been sorted out, the scientific community agrees that our tectonic plates are moving and have been for billions of years. Because these plates move independently, a fair amount of pushing and pulling between the plates occurs. The first type of interaction is a divergent boundary, in which two plates move away from one another. We see this in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa. The next interaction is when two plates collide, known as a convergent boundary. In this instance, the land is pushed upward to form large mountain ranges, like the Himalayas. In fact, the Indian Plate is still colliding with the Eurasian Plate, which is why Mount Everest grows one cm/year. Finally, there's the transform boundaries, where two plates scrape past one another. The grinding of the transform boundary leads to many earthquakes, which is what happens in the 810 mile-long San Andreas Fault. The moving Earth is unstoppable, and, while a shift of 10 cm/year may not seem like a lot, over millions of years our planet will continue to dramatically change. Mountains will rise, shorelines will recede, islands will pop up. In fact, one projected map shows the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco on top of each other. Maybe South America and Africa will come together again, too. Only time will tell.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Once upon a time, South America lived harmoniously alongside Africa until a crack in the Earth drove the two continents apart. This breakup began about 200 million years ago during the separation of the supercontinent known as Pangaea. Their proximity back then explains why the same plant fossils and reptile fossils, like the Mesosaurus, can be found on the South American east coast and African west coast. However, this evidence does not account for how the continents moved apart. For that, we'll need to take a close look at the earth below our feet. Though you may not realize it, the ground below you is traveling across the Earth at a rate of about 10 cm/year, or the speed at which your fingernails grow. This is due to plate tectonics, or the large-scale movement of Earth's continents. The motion occurs within the top two layers of the Earth's mantle, the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The lithosphere, which includes the crust and uppermost mantle, comprises the land around you. Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere the highly viscous but solid rock portion of the upper mantle. It's between 80 and 200 km below the Earth's surface. While the asthenosphere wraps around the Earth's core as one connected region, the lithosphere is separated on top into tectonic plates. There are seven primary tectonic plates that compose the shape of the planet we know today. Like the other smaller tectonic plates, the primary plates are about 100 km thick and are composed of one or two layers: continental crust and oceanic crust. Continental crust forms the continents and areas of shallow water close to their shores, whereas oceanic crust forms the ocean basins. The transition from the granitic continental crust to the basaltic oceanic crust occurs beyond the continentel shelf, in which the shore suddenly slopes down towards the ocean floor. The South American Plate is an example of a tectonic plate made of two crusts: the continent we know from today's map and a large region of the Atlantic Ocean around it. Collectively comprising the lithosphere, these plates are brittler and stiffer than the heated, malleable layer of the asthenosphere below. Because of this, the tectonic plates float on top of this layer, independently of one another. The speed and direction in which these tectonic plates move depends on the temperature and pressure of the asthenosphere below. Scientists are still trying to nail down the driving forces behind this movement, with some theories pointing towards mantle convection, while others are examining the influence of the Earth's rotation and gravitational pull. Though the mechanics have not been sorted out, the scientific community agrees that our tectonic plates are moving and have been for billions of years. Because these plates move independently, a fair amount of pushing and pulling between the plates occurs. The first type of interaction is a divergent boundary, in which two plates move away from one another. We see this in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between South America and Africa. The next interaction is when two plates collide, known as a convergent boundary. In this instance, the land is pushed upward to form large mountain ranges, like the Himalayas. In fact, the Indian Plate is still colliding with the Eurasian Plate, which is why Mount Everest grows one cm/year. Finally, there's the transform boundaries, where two plates scrape past one another. The grinding of the transform boundary leads to many earthquakes, which is what happens in the 810 mile-long San Andreas Fault. The moving Earth is unstoppable, and, while a shift of 10 cm/year may not seem like a lot, over millions of years our planet will continue to dramatically change. Mountains will rise, shorelines will recede, islands will pop up. In fact, one projected map shows the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco on top of each other. Maybe South America and Africa will come together again, too. Only time will tell.
