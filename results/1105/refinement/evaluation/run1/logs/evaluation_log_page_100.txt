**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed how the full moon looks bigger when it's near the horizon than when it's high over head? If so, you're not alone. People have wondered about this strange effect since ancient times, and surprisingly, we still don't have a great explanation, but that's not for lack of trying. Some of the greatest minds in history - Aristotle, Ptolemy, Da Vinci, Decartes - have all wrestled with this problem and failed to generate an adequate explanation. One of the first ideas suggested was that the image of the moon in the sky really is bigger near the horizon. Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a giant lens, magnifying the moon as it rises and sets. But this explanation doesn't cut it. If anything, the refraction of the atmosphere would make the moon look slightly smaller. Plus, if you actually measure the size of the visible moon at different positions, it doesn't change at all. But then, why does it still seem bigger when it's rising? This must be some kind of optical illusion. The question is, which one? One explanation is the Ebbinghaus Illusion, where two identical objects look different because of the relative size of the objects they're surrounded by. Here the two center circles are actually the same size. Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon because it's next to tiny trees, houses, and towers in the distance. But when the moon is higher up, it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky and looks tiny by comparison. Another possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion. If you've ever tried to draw in perspective, you know that the closer something is to the horizon, the smaller you should draw it. Our brain compensates automatically for this by perceiving objects near the horizon as larger than they actually appear. The two yellow lines in this drawing are the same size, but the upper one seems bigger because we interpret it as receding farther into the horizon. So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus, it seems like we've solved the mystery of the moon illusion, but, unfortunately, there are a few details that complicate things. For one thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect, then we would expect the moon illusion to disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds since there wouldn't be any other smaller objects near the horizon. But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion. On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting the size of objects near the horizon, then we'd expect the moon illusion to be visible inside a planetarium, where the whole sky, including the horizon, is displayed on a spherical dome overhead. Studies have shown, though, that this is not the case. To make matters worse, it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely if you just bend over and look at the moon between your legs. Now, this is just getting ridiculous! One of the most promising explanations today is known as Convergence Micropsia. Our brains judge the distance to objects and their apparent size by the focus of our eyes. When looking at the horizon, your eyes focus far off into the distance so your brain knows you're looking far away. The moon appears a certain size. Your brain thinks it's far away, which it is, so you naturally conclude the moon must be big. But when looking up at the night sky, there's nothing for your eyes to focus on, so they default to their rest focus, which is a point just a few meters away. Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer than it really is, so you naturally conclude the moon's not as big as you thought it was. Rather than explain why the moon looks so big near the horizon, Convergence Microspia explains why the moon looks so small when overhead. Still not satisfied? Well, frankly, neither are many scientists, so the debate over the moon illusion still rages on and may continue as long as we still see it in the night sky.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. However, the content of Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly addresses the effect of the atmosphere on the moon illusion. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the intent and content of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 4's neighbor, which discusses an illusion, or another question that involves the Earth's atmosphere.

Among the provided generated MCQs, Question 6 is the closest match. It involves the Earth's atmosphere indirectly by discussing what happens when there are no smaller objects near the horizon for comparison, which is related to the atmosphere's effect.

However, I must emphasize that Question 6 is not a perfect match for the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

This question directly asks about the Ebbinghaus illusion and provides the correct definition as the only option, which matches the correct option in the ground truth MCQ. Although it does not have the same format as the ground truth MCQ with multiple options, it is the most similar in terms of question intent and content.

However, if you're looking for a question with multiple options, Question 4 is also a good match. It asks about the Ebbinghaus illusion in the context of the moon illusion and provides the correct explanation as one of the options, which aligns with the ground truth MCQ.

But since the question is about the definition of the Ebbinghaus illusion itself, Question 3 is a more direct match.

Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a giant lens, magnifying the moon as it rises and sets. But this explanation doesn't cut it. If anything, the refraction of the atmosphere would make the moon look slightly smaller. Plus, if you actually measure the size of the visible moon at different positions, it doesn't change at all. But then, why does it still seem bigger when it's rising? This must be some kind of optical illusion. The question is, which one? One explanation is the Ebbinghaus Illusion, where two identical objects look different because of the relative size of the objects they're surrounded by. Here the two center circles are actually the same size. Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon because it's next to tiny trees, houses, and towers in the distance. But when the moon is higher up, it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky and looks tiny by comparison. Another possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion. If you've ever tried to draw in perspective, you know that the closer something is to the horizon, the smaller you should draw it. Our brain compensates automatically for this by perceiving objects near the horizon as larger than they actually appear. The two yellow lines in this drawing are the same size, but the upper one seems bigger because we interpret it as receding farther into the horizon. So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus, it seems like we've solved the mystery of the moon illusion, but, unfortunately, there are a few details that complicate things. For one thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect, then we would expect the moon illusion to disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds since there wouldn't be any other smaller objects near the horizon. But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion. On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting the size of objects near the horizon, then we'd expect the moon illusion to be visible inside a planetarium, where the whole sky, including the horizon, is displayed on a spherical dome overhead. Studies have shown, though, that this is not the case. To make matters worse, it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely if you just bend over and look at the moon between your legs. Now, this is just getting ridiculous! One of the most promising explanations today is known as Convergence Micropsia. Our brains judge the distance to objects and their apparent size by the focus of our eyes. When looking at the horizon, your eyes focus far off into the distance so your brain knows you're looking far away. The moon appears a certain size. Your brain thinks it's far away, which it is, so you naturally conclude the moon must be big. But when looking up at the night sky, there's nothing for your eyes to focus on, so they default to their rest focus, which is a point just a few meters away. Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer than it really is, so you naturally conclude the moon's not as big as you thought it was. Rather than explain why the moon looks so big near the horizon, Convergence Microspia explains why the moon looks so small when overhead. Still not satisfied? Well, frankly, neither are many scientists, so the debate over the moon illusion still rages on and may continue as long as we still see it in the night sky.

**Transcript**:
Have you experienced déjà vu? It's that shadowy feeling you get
when a situation seems familiar. A scene in a restaurant plays out
exactly as you remember. The world moves like a ballet
you've choreographed, but the sequence can't be based
on a past experience because you've never eaten here before. This is the first time you've had clams, so what's going on? Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation for déjà vu. The experience is brief
and occurs without notice, making it nearly impossible
for scientists to record and study it. Scientists can't simply sit around
and wait for it to happen to them -- this could take years. It has no physical manifestations and in studies, it's described by the subject
as a sensation or feeling. Because of this lack of hard evidence, there's been a surplus
of speculation over the years. Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu as a French term meaning "already seen," more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon. Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging
and cognitive psychology narrow down the field of prospects. Let's walk through three of today's
more prevalent theories, using the same
restaurant setting for each. First up is dual processing. We'll need an action. Let's go with a waiter
dropping a tray of dishes. As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres process
a flurry of information: the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell of pasta. Within milliseconds, this information
zips through pathways and is processed into a single moment. Most of the time,
everything is recorded in-sync. However, this theory asserts that déjà vu occurs
when there's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways. The difference in arrival times causes the brain to interpret
the late information as a separate event. When it plays
over the already-recorded moment, it feels as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has. Our next theory deals
with a confusion of the past rather than a mistake in the present. This is the hologram theory, and we'll use that tablecloth
to examine it. As you scan its squares, a distant memory swims up
from deep within your brain. According to the theory, this is because memories are stored in the form of holograms, and in holograms, you only need one fragment
to see the whole picture. Your brain has identified the tablecloth
with one from the past, maybe from your grandmother's house. However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's, your brain has summoned up the old memory without identifying it. This leaves you stuck with familiarity,
but no recollection. Although you've never been
in this restaurant, you've seen that tablecloth
but are just failing to identify it. Now, look at this fork. Are you paying attention? Our last theory is divided attention, and it states that déjà vu occurs when our brain subliminally
takes in an environment while we're distracted
by one particular object. When our attention returns, we feel as if we've been here before. For example, just now
you focused on the fork and didn't observe the tablecloth
or the falling waiter. Although your brain has been
recording everything in your peripheral vision, it's been doing so
below conscious awareness. When you finally pull yourself
away from the fork, you think you've been here before
because you have, you just weren't paying attention. While all three of these theories
share the common features of déjà vu, none of them propose to be
the conclusive source of the phenomenon. Still, while we wait
for researchers and inventers to come up with new ways
to capture this fleeting moment, we can study the moment ourselves. After all, most studies of déjà vu
are based on first-hand accounts, so why can't one be yours? The next time you get déjà vu,
take a moment to think about it. Have you been distracted? Is there a familiar object somewhere? Is your brain just acting slow? Or is it something else?

**Transcript**:
Have you experienced déjà vu? It's that shadowy feeling you get
when a situation seems familiar. A scene in a restaurant plays out
exactly as you remember. The world moves like a ballet
you've choreographed, but the sequence can't be based
on a past experience because you've never eaten here before. This is the first time you've had clams, so what's going on? Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation for déjà vu. The experience is brief
and occurs without notice, making it nearly impossible
for scientists to record and study it. Scientists can't simply sit around
and wait for it to happen to them -- this could take years. It has no physical manifestations and in studies, it's described by the subject
as a sensation or feeling. Because of this lack of hard evidence, there's been a surplus
of speculation over the years. Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu as a French term meaning "already seen," more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon. Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging
and cognitive psychology narrow down the field of prospects. Let's walk through three of today's
more prevalent theories, using the same
restaurant setting for each. First up is dual processing. We'll need an action. Let's go with a waiter
dropping a tray of dishes. As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres process
a flurry of information: the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell of pasta. Within milliseconds, this information
zips through pathways and is processed into a single moment. Most of the time,
everything is recorded in-sync. However, this theory asserts that déjà vu occurs
when there's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways. The difference in arrival times causes the brain to interpret
the late information as a separate event. When it plays
over the already-recorded moment, it feels as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has. Our next theory deals
with a confusion of the past rather than a mistake in the present. This is the hologram theory, and we'll use that tablecloth
to examine it. As you scan its squares, a distant memory swims up
from deep within your brain. According to the theory, this is because memories are stored in the form of holograms, and in holograms, you only need one fragment
to see the whole picture. Your brain has identified the tablecloth
with one from the past, maybe from your grandmother's house. However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's, your brain has summoned up the old memory without identifying it. This leaves you stuck with familiarity,
but no recollection. Although you've never been
in this restaurant, you've seen that tablecloth
but are just failing to identify it. Now, look at this fork. Are you paying attention? Our last theory is divided attention, and it states that déjà vu occurs when our brain subliminally
takes in an environment while we're distracted
by one particular object. When our attention returns, we feel as if we've been here before. For example, just now
you focused on the fork and didn't observe the tablecloth
or the falling waiter. Although your brain has been
recording everything in your peripheral vision, it's been doing so
below conscious awareness. When you finally pull yourself
away from the fork, you think you've been here before
because you have, you just weren't paying attention. While all three of these theories
share the common features of déjà vu, none of them propose to be
the conclusive source of the phenomenon. Still, while we wait
for researchers and inventers to come up with new ways
to capture this fleeting moment, we can study the moment ourselves. After all, most studies of déjà vu
are based on first-hand accounts, so why can't one be yours? The next time you get déjà vu,
take a moment to think about it. Have you been distracted? Is there a familiar object somewhere? Is your brain just acting slow? Or is it something else?

**Transcript**:
Using the word Shakespeare within any classroom in the 21st century has become almost as dangerous for teachers as putting balloons in a toaster. After uttering this simple word, the common teacher is met with a mass of groans, moans, devastated looks, and the occasional chair tossed in his or her direction. But Shakespearean works are not boring, confusing, long and painful plays written more than 400 years ago. They're adventures relating to the extremities of human nature: love, hate, jealousy, zealous ambition, fear, mistrust, deception, and murder. We owe much of our own language to his invention. He invented over 2,000 words for use in his plays, which still remain in the Oxford English Dictionary. Words like "countless" and "assassination" as well as phrases like "one fell swoop," "foul play," and even "to be in a pickle" all originated from William's brilliant brain. And there are many echoes of Shakespeare's romantic language too. If you read Romeo and Juliet, you'll come across sentences like, "She doth teach the torches to burn bright," and, "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows." Both are quite clever metaphors, suggesting that Juliet is both exceptionally beautiful and far moreso than anyone else. "For thou art as glorious to this night, being o'er my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven," is a simile suggesting angelic qualities of the lady in question. This is not too different from today's comments like, "Hey, beautiful!" and, "You're the hottest girl in the room." Shakespeare also uses slightly more complex metaphors to describe the intentions of a mischievous man. For instance, "This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss," essentially means, "I wish to kiss you." Such male intentions were not limited to simple pecks on the cheek either. An intentional ambiguity was often used as a cheeky means to proposition marriage or a more intimate relationship. Therefore, instead of viewing Shakespearean works as out-dated, boring, and unhelpful, start reading today and discover the best ways to get the one you love to love you back.

Such male intentions were not limited to simple pecks on the cheek either. An intentional ambiguity was often used as a cheeky means to proposition marriage or a more intimate relationship. Therefore, instead of viewing Shakespearean works as out-dated, boring, and unhelpful, start reading today and discover the best ways to get the one you love to love you back.

**Transcript**:
Using the word Shakespeare within any classroom in the 21st century has become almost as dangerous for teachers as putting balloons in a toaster. After uttering this simple word, the common teacher is met with a mass of groans, moans, devastated looks, and the occasional chair tossed in his or her direction. But Shakespearean works are not boring, confusing, long and painful plays written more than 400 years ago. They're adventures relating to the extremities of human nature: love, hate, jealousy, zealous ambition, fear, mistrust, deception, and murder. We owe much of our own language to his invention. He invented over 2,000 words for use in his plays, which still remain in the Oxford English Dictionary. Words like "countless" and "assassination" as well as phrases like "one fell swoop," "foul play," and even "to be in a pickle" all originated from William's brilliant brain. And there are many echoes of Shakespeare's romantic language too. If you read Romeo and Juliet, you'll come across sentences like, "She doth teach the torches to burn bright," and, "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows." Both are quite clever metaphors, suggesting that Juliet is both exceptionally beautiful and far moreso than anyone else. "For thou art as glorious to this night, being o'er my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven," is a simile suggesting angelic qualities of the lady in question. This is not too different from today's comments like, "Hey, beautiful!" and, "You're the hottest girl in the room." Shakespeare also uses slightly more complex metaphors to describe the intentions of a mischievous man. For instance, "This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss," essentially means, "I wish to kiss you."

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically cyberwarfare, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to Shakespearean language and literature.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 8 is the least dissimilar, but only because it has a slightly similar structure to the ground truth MCQ, with a quote and a question about its meaning. However, the content and options are still completely unrelated.

Therefore, I would not recommend matching any of the generated MCQs with the ground truth MCQ. Instead, I would suggest generating new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I really had to provide an index, I would say: 8 (but with the caveat that it's still not a good match).

**Transcript**:
As you can see, I was born without fingers on my right hand. And also my right leg was several inches shorter than my left one. They broke the bones in the leg, then they screwed metal spikes into the bone. It has not only spikes, but wires that go all the way through the leg to stabilize it. I have to walk on it. I have to stretch it out so that my muscles don't just get all atrophied. People always ask me, "Does it hurt?" Yes, it does, but I focus on what I can do, not on what I cannot do. I want to talk with you guys about overcoming obstacles. Everybody has obstacles, a disability, a hurdle. We face a choice: Let the obstacle overcome you or overcome the obstacle. Maybe some of you have heard of Jim Abbott. He was a Major League baseball player. He won a gold metal in the Olympics. He played for the Yankees, the Angels. But he threw a no-hitter, and he only had one arm. When he was a kid, he came home mad one time and told his dad, "The kids won't let me play baseball because I only have one hand." His dad replied, "No, the kids won't let you play baseball because you stink at baseball. You can't change the fact that you only have one hand, but you can change the fact that you stink." So, his dad began to practice with him, and he got good. He overcame obstacles. Teams would try to exploit his weak side. They would try to bunt to the side that he had a missing arm. But they never succeeded because he practiced and practiced fielding bunts to that side. There's no dishonor in having a disability, and I won't let anyone diss my ability, but I don't want anyone's pity either. I will not use the obstacles I face as an excuse for having a pity party. I will practice harder, play harder, and push myself harder to keep getting better. Last season I started on my varsity high school basketball team as a freshman, and I won Rookie of the Year. I was one of the top scorers on the team. One of the things that I find funny is that people judge me by appearance. They say, "Oh, look at this one-handed whitey with the limp. I don't want him on my team!" But what they don't know is that I don't just have a disability, I have an ability. One of my favorite moments from this last season was we played a team that we had never played before. And when the game started, you could tell that they were dissing my disability. I mean, they double-teamed our tallest player. They just were playing really soft on me, and they just, you could tell they thought, "What can this guy with one hand do?" So, they left me open for a three. I made that one. They left me open for another one. I made that one. Then, they started to get frustrated, so they actually fouled me. I made both free throws. And they called time out. And as we were in the huddle, I could hear the other coach yelling at his players about me. They went from not covering me at all to double-teaming me. It's all about overcoming obstacles. It's true, I have a disability, but so do you. I also have an ability, so do you. Everyone has obstacles to overcome. Some are visible like mine. Some are less visible. Maybe your obstacle is that you come from a poor neighborhood. Maybe people say you'll never amount to anything. Prove them wrong. Maybe your obstacle is that you have a learning disability, and people think that you're dumb. Prove them wrong. Maybe people judge you because of the color of your skin or your family background. Prove them wrong. I know a lot of people who take one look at me and judge me. They say, "Oh, that kid can't be any good at basketball. One leg, one hand." If someone things you can't overcome the obstacles, prove them wrong.

**Transcript**:
As you can see, I was born without fingers on my right hand. And also my right leg was several inches shorter than my left one. They broke the bones in the leg, then they screwed metal spikes into the bone. It has not only spikes, but wires that go all the way through the leg to stabilize it. I have to walk on it. I have to stretch it out so that my muscles don't just get all atrophied. People always ask me, "Does it hurt?" Yes, it does, but I focus on what I can do, not on what I cannot do. I want to talk with you guys about overcoming obstacles. Everybody has obstacles, a disability, a hurdle. We face a choice: Let the obstacle overcome you or overcome the obstacle. Maybe some of you have heard of Jim Abbott. He was a Major League baseball player. He won a gold metal in the Olympics. He played for the Yankees, the Angels. But he threw a no-hitter, and he only had one arm. When he was a kid, he came home mad one time and told his dad, "The kids won't let me play baseball because I only have one hand." His dad replied, "No, the kids won't let you play baseball because you stink at baseball. You can't change the fact that you only have one hand, but you can change the fact that you stink." So, his dad began to practice with him, and he got good. He overcame obstacles. Teams would try to exploit his weak side. They would try to bunt to the side that he had a missing arm. But they never succeeded because he practiced and practiced fielding bunts to that side. There's no dishonor in having a disability, and I won't let anyone diss my ability, but I don't want anyone's pity either. I will not use the obstacles I face as an excuse for having a pity party. I will practice harder, play harder, and push myself harder to keep getting better. Last season I started on my varsity high school basketball team as a freshman, and I won Rookie of the Year. I was one of the top scorers on the team. One of the things that I find funny is that people judge me by appearance. They say, "Oh, look at this one-handed whitey with the limp. I don't want him on my team!" But what they don't know is that I don't just have a disability, I have an ability. One of my favorite moments from this last season was we played a team that we had never played before. And when the game started, you could tell that they were dissing my disability. I mean, they double-teamed our tallest player. They just were playing really soft on me, and they just, you could tell they thought, "What can this guy with one hand do?" So, they left me open for a three. I made that one. They left me open for another one. I made that one. Then, they started to get frustrated, so they actually fouled me. I made both free throws. And they called time out. And as we were in the huddle, I could hear the other coach yelling at his players about me. They went from not covering me at all to double-teaming me. It's all about overcoming obstacles. It's true, I have a disability, but so do you. I also have an ability, so do you. Everyone has obstacles to overcome. Some are visible like mine. Some are less visible. Maybe your obstacle is that you come from a poor neighborhood. Maybe people say you'll never amount to anything. Prove them wrong. Maybe your obstacle is that you have a learning disability, and people think that you're dumb. Prove them wrong. Maybe people judge you because of the color of your skin or your family background. Prove them wrong. I know a lot of people who take one look at me and judge me. They say, "Oh, that kid can't be any good at basketball. One leg, one hand." If someone things you can't overcome the obstacles, prove them wrong.

**Transcript**:
Wars are a tragic part of our history and will almost certainly be a tragic part of our future. Since the establishment of the United Nations, wars of aggression have been outlawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war. But the wars of the future won't be like the wars of our past. Alongside traditional warfare, our future will include cyberwarfare, remotely fighting our enemies through the use of a new class of weapons, including computer viruses and programs to alter the enemy's ability to operate. And not only is cyberwarfare not covered by existing legal frameworks, but the question of what exactly constitutes cyberwarfare is still highly debated. So, how can we deal with cyberwarfare if we can't even agree on what it means? One way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed. Imagine a new kind of assassin, one that could perpetrate a crime without firing a single shot or even being in the same country. For example, an individual working for the government uses a wireless device to send a signal to another foreign leader's pacemaker. This device directs the pacemaker to malfunction, ultimately resulting in the foreign leader's death. Would this cyber assassination constitute an act of war? As a second example, imagine an allied group of nations cooperatively infiltrating the computer systems of an enemy nation's nuclear warship. This attack results in a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier almost melting down, which was stopped just short of killing thousands of soldiers and civilians. As a defensive measure, the enemy country responds by unleashing a defensive cyberattack that results in the allied nations' power grids going down. Hospitals can no longer treat patients, entire regions without heat or clean water, all ultimately causing tens of thousands civilian deaths. The origin of the power failure was the counterattack, but the fragile infrastructure, feeble cybersecurity, and the antiquated state of the power grid all contributed to the deaths of the civilians. Could the country fight back? Who would they fight? And would their retaliation be considered an act of war? Do they constitute war crimes against humanity? Who is to be held responsible? The computer programmers who wrote the code? The military project manager who oversaw the creation of the code? The commander who hit the button, setting off the event? The hardware engineer who created the computers, knowing that they were intended to enable an attack? Because war has been with us for so long, we have laws to deal with figuring out who should be held accountable for their actions in combat. These legal frameworks aim to contain and prevent atrocities from being more atrocious. Commandeering civilian planes and using them as weapons, dropping atomic bombs, the use of gas chambers or poisonous gas in conflict, all of these actions, if committed, constitute acts of war and war crimes under customary international law and the Hague conventions. Again, the current legal framework stays silent on hypothetical questions and countless others because there are no easy answers, and there are only two ways to make progress on these questions: peace or new laws. So, what hypothetical but plausible scenarios can you imagine falling under the burgeoning definition of cyberwarfare, and how might you design an international legal framework to deter these activities?

As a second example, imagine an allied group of nations cooperatively infiltrating the computer systems of an enemy nation's nuclear warship. This attack results in a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier almost melting down, which was stopped just short of killing thousands of soldiers and civilians. As a defensive measure, the enemy country responds by unleashing a defensive cyberattack that results in the allied nations' power grids going down. Hospitals can no longer treat patients, entire regions without heat or clean water, all ultimately causing tens of thousands civilian deaths. The origin of the power failure was the counterattack, but the fragile infrastructure, feeble cybersecurity, and the antiquated state of the power grid all contributed to the deaths of the civilians. Could the country fight back? Who would they fight? And would their retaliation be considered an act of war? Do they constitute war crimes against humanity? Who is to be held responsible? The computer programmers who wrote the code? The military project manager who oversaw the creation of the code? The commander who hit the button, setting off the event? The hardware engineer who created the computers, knowing that they were intended to enable an attack? Because war has been with us for so long, we have laws to deal with figuring out who should be held accountable for their actions in combat. These legal frameworks aim to contain and prevent atrocities from being more atrocious. Commandeering civilian planes and using them as weapons, dropping atomic bombs, the use of gas chambers or poisonous gas in conflict, all of these actions, if committed, constitute acts of war and war crimes under customary international law and the Hague conventions. Again, the current legal framework stays silent on hypothetical questions and countless others because there are no easy answers, and there are only two ways to make progress on these questions: peace or new laws. So, what hypothetical but plausible scenarios can you imagine falling under the burgeoning definition of cyberwarfare, and how might you design an international legal framework to deter these activities?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as education and teaching methods, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to cyberwarfare and international law.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 7 is the closest match. But this is a very weak match, as the content and intent of the question are completely different.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ would be needed to match the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or Question 7, but with a very weak match)

**Transcript**:
Wars are a tragic part of our history and will almost certainly be a tragic part of our future. Since the establishment of the United Nations, wars of aggression have been outlawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war. But the wars of the future won't be like the wars of our past. Alongside traditional warfare, our future will include cyberwarfare, remotely fighting our enemies through the use of a new class of weapons, including computer viruses and programs to alter the enemy's ability to operate. And not only is cyberwarfare not covered by existing legal frameworks, but the question of what exactly constitutes cyberwarfare is still highly debated. So, how can we deal with cyberwarfare if we can't even agree on what it means? One way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed. Imagine a new kind of assassin, one that could perpetrate a crime without firing a single shot or even being in the same country. For example, an individual working for the government uses a wireless device to send a signal to another foreign leader's pacemaker. This device directs the pacemaker to malfunction, ultimately resulting in the foreign leader's death. Would this cyber assassination constitute an act of war?

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the UN rules of cyber engagement, and the correct answer is "None exist." 

The generated MCQs are about education and do not relate to the topic of the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 10 is the least dissimilar in terms of having a broad topic, but it is still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to pick the least dissimilar one, it would be:

None (However, if I really had to choose, I would say Question 10, but with the understanding that it is still very dissimilar.)

Please note that this is not a good match, and the generated MCQs do not align with the ground truth MCQ. A new set of generated MCQs that are more relevant to the topic would be needed to find a good match.

**Transcript**:
On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world. On average, it's the coldest, windiest, driest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles, but Antarctica is so dry, it's considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeters along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 degrees Celsius. Because it's so harsh and hard to get to, there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Even the most extreme animals fight for survival, and only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of algae, animals, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protista. But why is Antarctica colder than its northern cousin? Well, first, much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. That's why mountaintops have snow on them. Second, remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean. The water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic, and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack. This prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic. During the aphelion in July, when the Earth is the farthest away from the Sun, it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic, which creates a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole. But despite being inhospitable, the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is. Both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers. They help moderate the temperature in our temperate zones and give us stable weather. As sea ice in the Arctic declines due to climate change and global warming, weather around the globe becomes increasing more unstable.

**Transcript**:
On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world.

**Transcript**:
On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world. On average, it's the coldest, windiest, driest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles, but Antarctica is so dry, it's considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeters along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 degrees Celsius. Because it's so harsh and hard to get to, there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Even the most extreme animals fight for survival, and only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of algae, animals, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protista. But why is Antarctica colder than its northern cousin? Well, first, much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. That's why mountaintops have snow on them. Second, remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean. The water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic, and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack. This prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic. During the aphelion in July, when the Earth is the farthest away from the Sun, it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic, which creates a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole. But despite being inhospitable, the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is. Both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers. They help moderate the temperature in our temperate zones and give us stable weather. As sea ice in the Arctic declines due to climate change and global warming, weather around the globe becomes increasing more unstable.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What's the story with snow in Antarctica?
Options: A. It snows about 1 foot every single day, B. It snows 3 meters a day, C. There is no precipitation on Antarctica, D. There is only an annual precipitation of 200 mm (8 inches)
Correct Option: D

**Transcript**:
I have been teaching for a long time and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students in 1931 my grandmother bottom left for you guys over here graduated from the eighth grade she went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived it was in the books it was inside the teacher's head and she needed to go there to get the information because that's how you learned fast forwarded generation this is the one-room schoolhouse Oak Grove my father went to a one-room schoolhouse and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored in the only portable memory he has which is inside his own head and take it with him because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world when I was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house it was purchased the year I was born and it was extraordinary because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome this was different than either generation had experienced before and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level but the information was closer to me I could get access to it in the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching we really see the advent of the internet right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas small town Kansas where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely small town rural Kansas School District where I was teaching my favorite subject American government my first year super gung-ho going to teach American government love the political system kids in the 12th grade not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system you're too learned a few things had to change my tactic and I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it I posed a problem in front of them which was to put on an election form for their own community they produced fliers they called offices they check schedules they were meeting with secretaries they produced an election form booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and you know whether or not the streets were done well and really had this robust experiential learning the older teachers more experienced looked at me and went oh there she is that's so cute she's trying to get that done she doesn't know what she's in for but I knew that the kids would show up and I and I believed it and I told them every week um what I expected out of them and that night all 90 kids dressed appropriately doing their job owning it I had to just sit and watch it was theirs it was experiential it was authentic it meant something to them and they will step up from Kansas I moved on to lovely Arizona where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years this time with middle school students luckily I didn't have to teach them American government could teach the more exciting topic of geography and again thrilled to learn but what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities and one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina which is the gentleman that the movie Hotel Rwanda is based after and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us we could walk there we didn't even have to pay for the buses there was no expense cost perfect field trip the problem then becomes how do you take seventh and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life or in their own story or in their own world that they could identify that had done a similar thing I asked them to produce a little movie about it first time we've done this nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer but they were into it and I to put their own voice over it it was the most awesome moment of Revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves what they're willing to share the last question of the assignment is how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary fast-forward to Pennsylvania where I find myself today I teach at the science Leadership Academy which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia we are a nine through twelve public school but we do school quite differently I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learn and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you were willing to kind of let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school into a moment where we have information surplus and so what do you do when the information is all around you why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information in Pennsylvania we have in Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program so the kids are bringing in laptops with them every day taking them home getting access to information and here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process we deal right now in the educational landscape with an it just an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple-choice test and I am here to share with you it is not learning that is the absolute wrong thing to ask to tell kids to never be wrong to ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn so we did this project and this is one of the artifacts of the project I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of

**Transcript**:
I have been teaching for a long time and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students in 1931 my grandmother bottom left for you guys over here graduated from the eighth grade she went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived it was in the books it was inside the teacher's head and she needed to go there to get the information because that's how you learned fast forwarded generation this is the one-room schoolhouse Oak Grove my father went to a one-room schoolhouse and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored in the only portable memory he has which is inside his own head and take it with him because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world when I was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house it was purchased the year I was born and it was extraordinary because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome this was different than either generation had experienced before and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level but the information was closer to me I could get access to it in the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching we really see the advent of the internet right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas small town Kansas where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely small town rural Kansas School District where I was teaching my favorite subject American government my first year super gung-ho going to teach American government love the political system kids in the 12th grade not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system you're too learned a few things had to change my tactic and I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it I posed a problem in front of them which was to put on an election form for their own community they produced fliers they called offices they check schedules they were meeting with secretaries they produced an election form booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and you know whether or not the streets were done well and really had this robust experiential learning the older teachers more experienced looked at me and went oh there she is that's so cute she's trying to get that done she doesn't know what she's in for but I knew that the kids would show up and I and I believed it and I told them every week um what I expected out of them and that night all 90 kids dressed appropriately doing their job owning it I had to just sit and watch it was theirs it was experiential it was authentic it meant something to them and they will step up from Kansas I moved on to lovely Arizona where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years this time with middle school students luckily I didn't have to teach them American government could teach the more exciting topic of geography and again thrilled to learn but what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities and one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina which is the gentleman that the movie Hotel Rwanda is based after and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us we could walk there we didn't even have to pay for the buses there was no expense cost perfect field trip the problem then becomes how do you take seventh and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life or in their own story or in their own world that they could identify that had done a similar thing I asked them to produce a little movie about it first time we've done this nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer but they were into it and I to put their own voice over it it was the most awesome moment of Revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves what they're willing to share the last question of the assignment is how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary fast-forward to Pennsylvania where I find myself today I teach at the science Leadership Academy which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia we are a nine through twelve public school but we do school quite differently I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learn and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you were willing to kind of let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school into a moment where we have information surplus and so what do you do when the information is all around you why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information in Pennsylvania we have in Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program so the kids are bringing in laptops with them every day taking them home getting access to information and here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process we deal right now in the educational landscape with an it just an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple-choice test and I am here to share with you it is not learning that is the absolute wrong thing to ask to tell kids to never be wrong to ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn so we did this project and this is one of the artifacts of the project I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure my students produce these infographics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the infographics that existed you know in a lot of mass media and take a look at what were the interesting components of it and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history and they had certain criteria to do it they were a little uncomfortable with it because we never done this before and they didn't know exactly how to do it they can talk they are very smooth and they can write very very well but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them but I gave them the room to just do the thing go create go figure it out let's let's see what we can do and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint this was done in like two or three days and this is the work of the student that consistently did it when I sat the students down I said who's got the best one and they immediately went there it is didn't read anything there it is and I said well what makes it great in there like oh the design is good and he's using good color and they're submitting it and they went through all of we processed out loud and I said go read it and they're like Oh Alan that one wasn't so awesome and then we went to another one he didn't have good visuals but had great information and spent an hour talking about the learning process because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect or whether or not it was what I could create it asked them to create for themselves and it allowed them to fail process learn from and when we do another round of this in my class this year they will do better this time because learning has to include amount and amount of failure because failure is instructional in the process there are a million pictures that I could click through here and had to choose carefully this is one of my favourites of students learning of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information but instead ask them what they can do with it ask some really interesting questions they will not disappoint ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire this is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on Tuesday when I asked the students to go to the polls this is Robbie and this was his first day of voting and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that but this is learning too because we asked them to go out into real spaces the main point is that if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning empowering student voice and embracing failure we're missing the mark and everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities because we won't get there with a standardized test and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer we

how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world when I was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house it was purchased the year I was born and it was extraordinary because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome this was different than either generation had experienced before and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level but the information was closer to me I could get access to it in the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching we really see the advent of the internet right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas small town Kansas where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely small town rural Kansas School District where I was teaching my favorite subject American government my first year super gung-ho going to teach American government love the political system kids in the 12th grade not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system you're too learned a few things had to change my tactic and I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it I posed a problem in front of them which was to put on an election form for their own community they produced fliers they called offices they check schedules they were meeting with secretaries they produced an election form booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and you know whether or not the streets were done well and really had this robust experiential learning the older teachers more experienced looked at me and went oh there she is that's so cute she's trying to get that done she doesn't know what she's in for but I knew that the kids would show up and I and I believed it and I told them every week um what I expected out of them and that night all 90 kids dressed appropriately doing their job owning it I had to just sit and watch it was theirs it was experiential it was authentic it meant something to them and they will step up from Kansas I moved on to lovely Arizona where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years this time with middle school students luckily I didn't have to teach them American government could teach the more exciting topic of geography and again thrilled to learn but what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities and one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina which is the gentleman that the movie Hotel Rwanda is based after and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us we could walk there we didn't even have to pay for the buses there was no expense cost perfect field trip the problem then becomes how do you take seventh and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life or in their own story or in their own world that they could identify that had done a similar thing I asked them to produce a little movie about it first time we've done this nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer but they were into it and I to put their own voice over it it was the most awesome moment of Revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves what they're willing to share the last question of the assignment is how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary fast-forward to Pennsylvania where I find myself today I teach at the science Leadership Academy which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia we are a nine through twelve public school but we do school quite differently I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learn and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you were willing to kind of let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school into a moment where we have information surplus and so what do you do when the information is all around you why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information in Pennsylvania we have in Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program so the kids are bringing in laptops with them every day taking them home getting access to information and here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process we deal right now in the educational landscape with an it just an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple-choice test and I am here to share with you it is not learning that is the absolute wrong thing to ask to tell kids to never be wrong to ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn so we did this project and this is one of the artifacts of the project I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure my students produce these infographics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the infographics that existed you know in a lot of mass media and take a look at what were the interesting components of it and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history and they had certain criteria to do it they were a little uncomfortable with it because we never done this before and they didn't know exactly how to do it they can talk they are very smooth and they can write very very well but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them but I gave them the room to just do the thing go create go figure it out let's let's see what we can do and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint this was done in like two or three days and this is the work of the student that consistently did it when I sat the students down I said who's got the best one and they immediately went there it is didn't read anything there it is and I said well what makes it great in there like oh the design is good and he's using good color and they're submitting it and they went through all of we processed out loud and I said go read it and they're like Oh Alan that one wasn't so awesome and then we went to another one he didn't have good visuals but had great information and spent an hour talking about the learning process because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect or whether or not it was what I could create it asked them to create for themselves and it allowed them to fail process learn from and when we do another round of this in my class this year they will do better this time because learning has to include amount and amount of failure because failure is instructional in the process there are a million pictures that I could click through here and had to choose carefully this is one of my favourites of students learning of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information but instead ask them what they can do with it ask some really interesting questions they will not disappoint ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire this is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on Tuesday when I asked the students to go to the polls this is Robbie and this was his first day of voting and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that but this is learning too because we asked them to go out into real spaces the main point is that if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning empowering student voice and embracing failure we're missing the mark and everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities because we won't get there with a standardized test and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer we know how to do this better and it's time to do better

**Transcript**:
I have been teaching for a long time and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students in 1931 my grandmother bottom left for you guys over here graduated from the eighth grade she went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived it was in the books it was inside the teacher's head and she needed to go there to get the information because that's how you learned fast forwarded generation this is the one-room schoolhouse Oak Grove my father went to a one-room schoolhouse and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored in the only portable memory he has which is inside his own head and take it with him because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world when I was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house it was purchased the year I was born and it was extraordinary because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome this was different than either generation had

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a completely different topic, such as chemistry and digestion, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to education and learning.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that Question 10 is the closest match. But again, the content and intent of Question 10 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or Question 10, but with a big caveat that the content and intent are completely different)

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the topic of genetically engineered seeds or organisms, and instead appear to be related to social psychology and impression formation.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar in terms of format, but not in terms of content or intent.

hello my name is Bert Baer and I'm 11 years old I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system first of all I would like to say that I'm really amazed how easily kids rolla to believe all the marketing advertising on TV at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look it seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids like me to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet little kids especially are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys I must admit I used to be one of them I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows graze on grass all day what I discovered was this is not true I began to look into the stuff on the internet in books and in documentary films in my travels with my family I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system first there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms that is what seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not in tune by nature like taking the DNA of fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato yuck don't get me wrong I like fish and tomatoes but this is just creepy the seeds the seeds our complaintant then grow the food they produce an improvement cost cancer and other problems of lab animals and people have been eat food produced this way since the 1990s most folks don't even know they exist did you know rats fed genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity these include kidney inflammation and lesions in the crease kidney wait yeah almost all the corn wheat has been altered in ethically in some way and let me tell you corn isn't everything and don't even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations called K flows conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels they mix with the dirt to make plants grow they do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again next more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables like pesticides and herbicides to kill weeds and bugs when it rains these chemicals seep into the ground or run up into our waterways poisoning our water too then they are radiates our food trying to make it last longer so it can travel thousands of miles from what's grown to the supermarkets so I ask myself how can I change how can I change these things this is what I found out I discovered that there's a movement for a better way now while back I wanted to be an NFL football player I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead and that way I can have a greater impact on the world this man Joel Salatin they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system since I'm homeschooled I want to go here speak one day this man this lunatic farmer doesn't use any pesticides herbicides or genetically modified seeds and so for that he's called crazy by the system I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices by buying our food directly from local farmers or neighbors we know in real life some people say organic or local food is more expensive but is it really with all these things I've been learning about the food system it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital I know now I know definitely which one I would choose I want you to know that there are farms out there I built here and so qua Chico's farms in Tennessee whose cows do t grass and his pigs do own the mug just like I thought sometimes I got to Bill's farm and volunteer so I can see up close and personal where the meat comes from I want you to know that I believe kids wheat fresh vegetables and good food ethic nor more about it and her really comes from I want you to know that there are farmers markets in every community popping up I want you to know that me my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips I try to share this everywhere I go not too long ago my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal he asked if he wanted organic touch the O's or the sugar-coated flakes you know the one of the big stripe and cartoon character on the front my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic touch with Oh cereal because Burke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal and that my friends is how we can make a difference one K at a time so next time you're at the grocery store think local choose organic know your font and know your food you

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the topic of the transcript, which is about the problems with the food system and the benefits of organic farming.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 3, but only because it mentions "negative information" and "impact", which could be vaguely related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is about the negative effects of genetically engineered food. However, the question intent, options, and content are still very different.

Index: 3 (but with a note that none of the generated MCQs are a good match)

**Transcript**:
We already know that the world is made of things, things like cats and macaroni salad, and macaroni salad is made of things like mayo and mustard and celery, which are all made of molecules. As we'll see, these molecules are made of the same stuff, just mixed together in different ways. Let's go back to our macaroni salad. We've already unmixed things physically as much as we can. Now, we'll go further and unmix things chemically by breaking some bonds. Many larger, complex molecules are just a bunch of smaller molecules bonded together like building blocks. Here, again, macaroni salad provides a nice example. If you look at the pasta, you'll notice it's made of a lot of this stuff, starch, which is this molecule, otherwise known as amylose. Turns out, if you break some bonds, amylose is made up of smaller molecules of glucose, a simple sugar. If you take a bunch of these same glucose molecules and rearrange them in a different way, you get cellulose, which is what plants are made of. So, while this piece of pasta made of amylose and this wooden spoon made of cellulose look vastly different, they're both essentially made of the same molecules, just stuck together differently. This type of breaking apart and recombining is what goes on when you digest food. The complex proteins found in the foods we eat, like carrots and eggs, can't be used by our bodies because we are not carrots or chickens. What we can use are the smaller molecules that make up these proteins, the amino acids. During digestion, our bodies break these proteins up into their amino acids so they can be rearranged and put back together to make human proteins. But let's keep breaking bonds. All molecules are made up of atoms bonded together. If some molecules are building blocks, atoms are the building blocks of the building blocks. And you'll notice that with the molecules from macaroni salad, the same six types of atoms keep showing up: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, or CHONPS. There's a few others, but the big six is what macaroni salad is made of. If we went a step further, we could use these same atoms, recombine them, and make other stuff like gasoline or sulfuric acid, methane, and nylon. It's all made from the same elements that make up macaroni salad. So, to recap, everything is made of atoms. They are the stuff that things are made of. Atoms are grouped together in different ways to form molecules. These molecules are constantly being combined, broken apart, and recombined. They get thrown into mixtures, separated, remixed over and over and over again. The stuff that things are made of is always in flux; it's always changing. Macaroni salad is only macaroni salad for a short time. You eat it, some of it becomes part of you, the rest eventually goes into the ocean and gets eaten by other animals that die, and after millions of years, they turn into oil, which is where gasoline comes from. And that's why gasoline and macaroni salad are not that different - they're both made of the same stuff, just one tastes better.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Many larger complex molecules are just ________.

**Transcript**:
We already know that the world is made of things, things like cats and macaroni salad, and macaroni salad is made of things like mayo and mustard and celery, which are all made of molecules. As we'll see, these molecules are made of the same stuff, just mixed together in different ways. Let's go back to our macaroni salad. We've already unmixed things physically as much as we can. Now, we'll go further and unmix things chemically by breaking some bonds. Many larger, complex molecules are just a bunch of smaller molecules bonded together like building blocks. Here, again, macaroni salad provides a nice example. If you look at the pasta, you'll notice it's made of a lot of this stuff, starch, which is this molecule, otherwise known as amylose. Turns out, if you break some bonds, amylose is made up of smaller molecules of glucose, a simple sugar. If you take a bunch of these same glucose molecules and rearrange them in a different way, you get cellulose, which is what plants are made of. So, while this piece of pasta made of amylose and this wooden spoon made of cellulose look vastly different, they're both essentially made of the same molecules, just stuck together differently. This type of breaking apart and recombining is what goes on when you digest food. The complex proteins found in the foods we eat, like carrots and eggs, can't be used by our bodies because we are not carrots or chickens. What we can use are the smaller molecules that make up these proteins, the amino acids. During digestion, our bodies break these proteins up into their amino acids so they can be rearranged and put back together to make human proteins. But let's keep breaking bonds. All molecules are made up of atoms bonded together. If some molecules are building blocks, atoms are the building blocks of the building blocks. And you'll notice that with the molecules from macaroni salad, the same six types of atoms keep showing up: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, or CHONPS. There's a few others, but the big six is what macaroni salad is made of. If we went a step further, we could use these same atoms, recombine them, and make other stuff like gasoline or sulfuric acid, methane, and nylon. It's all made from the same elements that make up macaroni salad. So, to recap, everything is made of atoms. They are the stuff that things are made of. Atoms are grouped together in different ways to form molecules. These molecules are constantly being combined, broken apart, and recombined. They get thrown into mixtures, separated, remixed over and over and over again. The stuff that things are made of is always in flux; it's always changing. Macaroni salad is only macaroni salad for a short time. You eat it, some of it becomes part of you, the rest eventually goes into the ocean and gets eaten by other animals that die, and after millions of years, they turn into oil, which is where gasoline comes from. And that's why gasoline and macaroni salad are not that different - they're both made of the same stuff, just one tastes better.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're at a football game when this obnoxious guy sits next to you. He's loud, he spills his drink on you, and he makes fun of your team. Days later, you're walking in the park when suddenly it starts to pour rain. Who should show up at your side to offer you an umbrella? The same guy from the football game. Do you change your mind about him based on this second encounter, or do you go with your first impression and write him off? Research in social psychology suggests that we're quick to form lasting impressions of others based on their behaviors. We manage to do this with little effort, inferring stable character traits from a single behavior, like a harsh word or a clumsy step. Using our impressions as guides, we can accurately predict how people are going to behave in the future. Armed with the knowledge the guy from the football game was a jerk the first time you met him, you might expect more of the same down the road. If so, you might choose to avoid him the next time you see him. That said, we can change our impressions in light of new information. Behavioral researchers have identified consistent patterns that seem to guide this process of impression updating. On one hand, learning very negative, highly immoral information about someone typically has a stronger impact than learning very positive, highly moral information. So, unfortunately for our new friend from the football game, his bad behavior at the game might outweigh his good behavior at the park. Research suggests that this bias occurs because immoral behaviors are more diagnostic, or revealing, of a person's true character. Okay, so by this logic, bad is always stronger than good when it comes to updating. Well, not necessarily. Certain types of learning don't seem to lead to this sort of negativity bias. When learning about another person's abilities and competencies, for instance, this bias flips. It's actually the positive information that gets weighted more heavily. Let's go back to that football game. If a player scores a goal, it ultimately has a stronger impact on your impression of their skills than if they miss the net. The two sides of the updating story are ultimately quite consistent. Overall, behaviors that are perceived as being less frequent are also the ones that people tend to weigh more heavily when forming and updating impressions, highly immoral actions and highly competent actions. So, what's happening at the level of the brain when we're updating our impressions? Using fMRI, or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, researchers have identified an extended network of brain regions that respond to new information that's inconsistent with initial impressions. These include areas typically associated with social cognition, attention, and cognitive control. Moreover, when updating impressions based on people's behaviors, activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus correlates with perceptions of how frequently those behaviors occur in daily life. In other words, the brain seems to be tracking low-level, statistical properties of behavior in order to make complex decisions regarding other people's character. It needs to decide is this person's behavior typical or is it out of the ordinary? In the situation with the obnoxious-football-fan-turned-good-samaritan, your brain says, "Well, in my experience, pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella, but the way this guy acted at the football game, that was unusual." And so, you decide to go with your first impression. There's a good moral in this data: your brain, and by extension you, might care more about the very negative, immoral things another person has done compared to the very positive, moral things, but it's a direct result of the comparative rarity of those bad behaviors. We're more used to people being basically good, like taking time to help a stranger in need. In this context, bad might be stronger than good, but only because good is more plentiful. Think about the last time you judged someone based on their behavior, especially a time when you really feel like you changed your mind about someone. Was the behavior that caused you to update your impression something you'd expect anyone to do, or was it something totally out of the ordinary?

In the situation with the obnoxious-football-fan-turned-good-samaritan, your brain says, "Well, in my experience, pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella, but the way this guy acted at the football game, that was unusual." And so, you decide to go with your first impression. There's a good moral in this data: your brain, and by extension you, might care more about the very negative, immoral things another person has done compared to the very positive, moral things, but it's a direct result of the comparative rarity of those bad behaviors. We're more used to people being basically good, like taking time to help a stranger in need. In this context, bad might be stronger than good, but only because good is more plentiful. Think about the last time you judged someone based on their behavior, especially a time when you really feel like you changed your mind about someone. Was the behavior that caused you to update your impression something you'd expect anyone to do, or was it something totally out of the ordinary?

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're at a football game when this obnoxious guy sits next to you. He's loud, he spills his drink on you, and he makes fun of your team. Days later, you're walking in the park when suddenly it starts to pour rain. Who should show up at your side to offer you an umbrella? The same guy from the football game. Do you change your mind about him based on this second encounter, or do you go with your first impression and write him off? Research in social psychology suggests that we're quick to form lasting impressions of others based on their behaviors. We manage to do this with little effort, inferring stable character traits from a single behavior, like a harsh word or a clumsy step. Using our impressions as guides, we can accurately predict how people are going to behave in the future. Armed with the knowledge the guy from the football game was a jerk the first time you met him, you might expect more of the same down the road. If so, you might choose to avoid him the next time you see him. That said, we can change our impressions in light of new information. Behavioral researchers have identified consistent patterns that seem to guide this process of impression updating. On one hand, learning very negative, highly immoral information about someone typically has a stronger impact than learning very positive, highly moral information. So, unfortunately for our new friend from the football game, his bad behavior at the game might outweigh his good behavior at the park. Research suggests that this bias occurs because immoral behaviors are more diagnostic, or revealing, of a person's true character. Okay, so by this logic, bad is always stronger than good when it comes to updating. Well, not necessarily. Certain types of learning don't seem to lead to this sort of negativity bias. When learning about another person's abilities and competencies, for instance, this bias flips. It's actually the positive information that gets weighted more heavily. Let's go back to that football game. If a player scores a goal, it ultimately has a stronger impact on your impression of their skills than if they miss the net. The two sides of the updating story are ultimately quite consistent. Overall, behaviors that are perceived as being less frequent are also the ones that people tend to weigh more heavily when forming and updating impressions, highly immoral actions and highly competent actions. So, what's happening at the level of the brain when we're updating our impressions? Using fMRI, or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, researchers have identified an extended network of brain regions that respond to new information that's inconsistent with initial impressions. These include areas typically associated with social cognition, attention, and cognitive control. Moreover, when updating impressions based on people's behaviors, activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus correlates with perceptions of how frequently those behaviors occur in daily life. In other words, the brain seems to be tracking low-level, statistical properties of behavior in order to make complex decisions regarding other people's character. It needs to decide is this person's behavior typical or is it out of the ordinary? In the situation with the obnoxious-football-fan-turned-good-samaritan, your brain says, "Well, in my experience, pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella, but the way this guy acted at the football game, that was unusual." And so, you decide to go with your first impression.

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm Medium Invader from the classic video game Space Invaders, and I want to tell you a little bit about where video games came from. A video game is an electronic game that has an interface designed for human interaction on a video device. Simple. Video games are used by scientists, the military, and people like you, and their evolution has spread across arcades, consoles, computers, smart phones, and all kinds of other electronics. These days video games are everywhere, but they were actually made in science labs. In fact, the earliest U.S. video game patent on record was in 1948, and at the time it was referred to as a cathode-ray tube amusement device. That's a mouthful! Some of the earliest video games include the Nimrod computer, OXO, Tennis for Two, and my personal favorite, Spacewar! But none of these early video games were ever sold to the public because they were either too huge or too expensive to get out of the lab. This all changed when a man named Ralph Baer looked at his television screen and wondered how else it might be used. In 1972, Baer's idea to get video games out of the science lab and into the living room led to the release of a game console called Odyssey. Odyssey allowed you to play a game on your TV. At about the same time, two other people, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, were working on something similar in a little company called Atari. You might have heard of it, and even if you haven't, I'm sure that your Dad has. Atari's first major game release was in 1972, an arcade game called Pong. It was an immediate hit, and it's credited as the first commercially successful video game. Atari then released a home version of Pong in 1974. By 1978, competition between Atari and another game company called Midway was heating up. Midway had licensed an arcade game for the Japanese company, Taito, that put them on the map. The game: Space Invaders. It featured iconic actors, like me, and it went on to become the second highest selling arcade game of all time. Space Invaders also helped kick off what is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games. In response, Atari followed with the release of the arcade game Asteroids, which ranked sixth on the list of highest selling arcade games. It was a good game, but it's no Space Invaders. By 1980, color came to arcade games, and this was also the year that another video gaming milestone was born. Pac-Man, created by the Japanese company Namco, was brought to the U.S. by Midway. Important to the spread of video games into popular culture, Pac-Man was a character that could be licensed. It wasn't long before it had a song on the charts, a Saturday morning television show, and all sorts of other products. In just a year, Pac-Man arcade games made over one billion dollars in quarters. Then, in 1981, a company called Nintendo started making waves in the U.S. video game market with their release of Donkey Kong. It was the earliest video game to have a story line. The story went a bit like this: Donkey Kong is the pet of a carpenter named Jumpman. Jumpman mistreats his pet ape, so the ape steals his girlfriend, leaving the game player to assume the role of Jumpman and rescue the girl. Jumpman was eventually renamed to Mario. Other iconic arcade games from the early 80s include Frogger, Dragon's Lair, and Mario Brothers. Perhaps the last iconic game considered to be part of the Golden Age of Arcade Games is Double Dragon. It was the first really successful example of the beat-them-up genre. It was released in 1987, and, like Donkey Kong, it featured a damsel in distress storyline, a storyline common in many video games. By the mid-90s, the Golden Age of Arcade Games was coming to an end, and the home game console was gaining in popularity. While arcade games continued to decline in sales over the years, the popularity of video games was merely beginning, and we'll talk about that and a lot more in part two of a brief history of video games.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to Taoism, while the ground truth MCQ is about video games.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question format and style, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar in format, but not in content. It has a similar format of asking a general question and providing four options.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be: 4

However, please note that this is a very weak match, and the generated MCQs do not align with the ground truth MCQ in terms of content or intent.

Hi, I'm Medium Invader from the classic video game Space Invaders, and I want to tell you a little bit about where video games came from. A video game is an electronic game that has an interface designed for human interaction on a video device. Simple. Video games are used by scientists, the military, and people like you, and their evolution has spread across arcades, consoles, computers, smart phones, and all kinds of other electronics. These days video games are everywhere, but they were actually made in science labs. In fact, the earliest U.S. video game patent on record was in 1948, and at the time it was referred to as a cathode-ray tube amusement device. That's a mouthful! Some of the earliest video games include the Nimrod computer, OXO, Tennis for Two, and my personal favorite, Spacewar! But none of these early video games were ever sold to the public because they were either too huge or too expensive to get out of the lab. This all changed when a man named Ralph Baer looked at his television screen and wondered how else it might be used. In 1972, Baer's idea to get video games out of the science lab and into the living room led to the release of a game console called Odyssey. Odyssey allowed you to play a game on your TV. At about the same time, two other people, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, were working on something similar in a little company called Atari. You might have heard of it, and even if you haven't, I'm sure that your Dad has. Atari's first major game release was in 1972, an arcade game called Pong. It was an immediate hit, and it's credited as the first commercially successful video game. Atari then released a home version of Pong in 1974. By 1978, competition between Atari and another game company called Midway was heating up. Midway had licensed an arcade game for the Japanese company, Taito, that put them on the map. The game: Space Invaders. It featured iconic actors, like me, and it went on to become the second highest selling arcade game of all time. Space Invaders also helped kick off what is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games. In response, Atari followed with the release of the arcade game Asteroids, which ranked sixth on the list of highest selling arcade games. It was a good game, but it's no Space Invaders. By 1980, color came to arcade games, and this was also the year that another video gaming milestone was born. Pac-Man, created by the Japanese company Namco, was brought to the U.S. by Midway. Important to the spread of video games into popular culture, Pac-Man was a character that could be licensed. It wasn't long before it had a song on the charts, a Saturday morning television show, and all sorts of other products. In just a year, Pac-Man arcade games made over one billion dollars in quarters. Then, in 1981, a company called Nintendo started making waves in the U.S. video game market with their release of Donkey Kong. It was the earliest video game to have a story line.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to Taoism, while the ground truth MCQ is related to video games.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question format (True/False or factual question), I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the format of the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar in terms of format, but not in terms of content. Question 6 has a factual format, but it's still not related to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

So, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician." What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics." But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them
this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up? Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else? I see, I see one way in the back. You sir, that's three. And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle. Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. (Applause) That's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators, I need to make sure
that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Audience: 22. AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47. AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No. AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case? OK, great. What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator. There is something called
the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself. For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25. AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators
that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do
the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do
on their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649. Would you each enter
that on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take
that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random
three-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number. How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way
that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,
any six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator. Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well? OK, what I'm going to try
and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring
a 10-digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting
for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem
thinking out loud. So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size. Now, I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,
starting with you. I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert
numbers into words. I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated; it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man." (Laughter) There's definitely
a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely. Sorry. (Laughter) If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance
that I will make a mistake here. If I do, don't tell me
what the mistake is; just say, "you're close,"
or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty
entertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do,
don't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK. So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific event in the transcript where Arthur Benjamin asks the audience to produce a calculator, whereas the generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the transcript and are discussing comedy and philosophy.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 1 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's still unrelated to the content of the ground truth MCQ.

three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing

call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator. Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well? OK, what I'm going to try
and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring
a 10-digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting
for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem
thinking out loud. So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size. Now, I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,
starting with you. I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert
numbers into words. I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated; it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man." (Laughter) There's definitely
a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely. Sorry. (Laughter) If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance
that I will make a mistake here. If I do, don't tell me
what the mistake is; just say, "you're close,"
or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty
entertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do,
don't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK. So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the definition of the square of a number, which is a mathematical concept. Among the generated MCQs, none of them directly ask about the square of a number. However, I can suggest that Question 3 is the most similar generated MCQ, as it asks about the concept of comedy related to truth, which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ but is the only question that mentions a concept related to a definition.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, which is comedy and its definition, and not mathematics. Therefore, I couldn't find a generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to select one, I would say Question 3 is the most similar, although it's not a good match.

Index: 3 (Note: This is not a good match, and the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic.)

**Transcript**:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician." What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics." But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them
this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up? Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else? I see, I see one way in the back. You sir, that's three. And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle. Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. (Applause) That's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators, I need to make sure
that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Audience: 22. AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47. AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No. AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case? OK, great. What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator. There is something called
the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself. For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25. AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators
that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do
the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do
on their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649. Would you each enter
that on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take
that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random
three-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number. How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way
that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,
any six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator. Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well? OK, what I'm going to try

to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,
starting with you. I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert
numbers into words. I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated; it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man." (Laughter) There's definitely

don't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK. So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649. Would you each enter
that on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take
that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random
three-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number. How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way
that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,
any six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator. Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well? OK, what I'm going to try
and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring
a 10-digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting
for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem
thinking out loud. So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size. Now, I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,
starting with you. I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert
numbers into words. I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated; it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man." (Laughter) There's definitely
a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely. Sorry. (Laughter) If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance
that I will make a mistake here. If I do, don't tell me
what the mistake is; just say, "you're close,"
or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty
entertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do,
don't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK. So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the transcript, specifically to the part where Arthur Benjamin asks people for their birthdate and tells them the day of the week they were born.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 9, because it is the only one that mentions a specific person (Henri Bergson) and a concept (the comic), similar to how the ground truth MCQ mentions Arthur Benjamin and his ability to tell the day of the week someone was born.

But please note that this is a very weak match, and the generated MCQs do not seem to be related to the transcript or the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 9 (but with a very low confidence)

**Transcript**:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician." What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics." But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them
this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up? Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else? I see, I see one way in the back. You sir, that's three. And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle. Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. (Applause) That's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators, I need to make sure
that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Audience: 22. AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47. AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No. AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case? OK, great. What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator. There is something called
the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself. For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25. AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators
that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do
the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do
on their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649. Would you each enter
that on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take

that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,
any six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something

doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,
starting with you. I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right?

in the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
You might have seen this symbol before, whether it's as a temporary tattoo or at a Chinese temple. It's called the yin-yang symbol. It comes from Taoism, a religion born in China and it has far more meaning than you probably realize. The yin is the dark swirl, and the yang is the light one, and each side has a dot of the opposite color, which gives a clue to the meaning of yin and yang. Everything contains the seed of its opposite. Darth Vadar has the seed of goodness, and Luke has the potential to follow his father to the dark side. Like Luke and his father, yin and yang are not total opposites, they are relative to each other. Taoists believe that the universe is made up of energies, vibrations, and matter, which behave differently in different contexts. Something can be yin or yang depending on, well, depending on lots of things. So, while wheat that's growing is yang, when it's being reaped, it's yin. A wave's crest is yang, and the trough is yin. Villages on the sunny side of a valley in China have names like Liuyang or Shiyang, but on the shady side, for example, of the Yangtze River Valley, there's Jiangyin. The brake is yin to the gas pedal's yang. An eggshell is yang, the egg inside is yin. You think you're getting it? Yang is harder, stronger, brighter, and faster, but one can turn into the other or are two sides of the same coin. The sunbeams are yang in comparison to the shadows. The pitch is yang, the catch is yin. The yang starts an action, and the yin receives it, completes it. Yin is the inside space of a cup; it wouldn't be a cup without it. Yang is the cup. The coffee's heat, however, is yang, and its blackness is yin. Yang goes berserk sometimes, but there's some very powerful yins, too, if they don't quite go berserk. Yin is the darker swirl, the female, but there is a white dot in it. And yang is the lighter, the male, but it has a black dot. Water flowing calmly in a river is yin, but when it goes over the waterfall, it's very yang. Toothpicks are yin compared with a telephone pole. The back of a person is more yang than the front. The top of a person is the yang end. Taoism teaches that there is a power in the universe. It's higher, deeper, and truer than any other force. They call it the Tao. It means the way. Like the Force in Star Wars, the Tao has two sides. Unlike other religions where the higher power is all good, and perhaps has an all-evil rival, Taoism teaches that we need to learn from both yin and yang. And unlike religions with gods that are personal, the higher power in Taoism is not. Taoists believe that living in harmony with the way, a person will not have to fight against the universe's natural flow. So, for example, listen more, argue less. Be ready to back up or undo something, and you will make even faster progress. Don't worry about being the best, be who you are. Live simply. Complications take you away from the Tao. "The wise person is flexible," Taoists say. Learning to use the Tao is what Taoism is all about, and that's why you should know your yin from your yang.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the concept of yin and yang in the context of a teacup, where the space inside the cup is considered yin.

Among the generated MCQs, none of them are directly related to the concept of yin and yang or the teacup example. However, some of them touch on the idea of balance, equilibrium, or the relationship between different states or entities.

If I had to choose one that is closest in terms of question intent, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar. It asks about the state of balance where the number of molecules in each state stops changing, even though reactions are still occurring. While this is not directly related to the concept of yin and yang, it does touch on the idea of balance and equilibrium, which is a key aspect of the yin-yang concept.

However, please note that this is a very loose connection, and the generated MCQs do not accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

And unlike religions with gods that are personal, the higher power in Taoism is not. Taoists believe that living in harmony with the way, a person will not have to fight against the universe's natural flow. So, for example, listen more, argue less. Be ready to back up or undo something, and you will make even faster progress. Don't worry about being the best, be who you are. Live simply. Complications take you away from the Tao. "The wise person is flexible," Taoists say. Learning to use the Tao is what Taoism is all about, and that's why you should know your yin from your yang.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is related to the concept of yin and yang energies in Taoism, while the generated MCQs appear to be related to chemistry and physics.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that somewhat matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would choose Question 7. This question discusses the difference between a reaction that can happen in one direction and a reaction that can happen in both directions, which can be loosely related to the concept of balance and harmony in Taoism.

But, please note that this is a very weak match, and the generated MCQs do not accurately represent the ground truth MCQ.

You might have seen this symbol before, whether it's as a temporary tattoo or at a Chinese temple. It's called the yin-yang symbol. It comes from Taoism, a religion born in China and it has far more meaning than you probably realize. The yin is the dark swirl, and the yang is the light one, and each side has a dot of the opposite color, which gives a clue to the meaning of yin and yang. Everything contains the seed of its opposite. Darth Vadar has the seed of goodness, and Luke has the potential to follow his father to the dark side. Like Luke and his father, yin and yang are not total opposites, they are relative to each other. Taoists believe that the universe is made up of energies, vibrations, and matter, which behave differently in different contexts. Something can be yin or yang depending on, well, depending on lots of things. So, while wheat that's growing is yang, when it's being reaped, it's yin. A wave's crest is yang, and the trough is yin. Villages on the sunny side of a valley in China have names like Liuyang or Shiyang, but on the shady side, for example, of the Yangtze River Valley, there's Jiangyin. The brake is yin to the gas pedal's yang. An eggshell is yang, the egg inside is yin. You think you're getting it? Yang is harder, stronger, brighter, and faster, but one can turn into the other or are two sides of the same coin. The sunbeams are yang in comparison to the shadows. The pitch is yang, the catch is yin. The yang starts an action, and the yin receives it, completes it. Yin is the inside space of a cup; it wouldn't be a cup without it. Yang is the cup. The coffee's heat, however, is yang, and its blackness is yin. Yang goes berserk sometimes, but there's some very powerful yins, too, if they don't quite go berserk. Yin is the darker swirl, the female, but there is a white dot in it. And yang is the lighter, the male, but it has a black dot. Water flowing calmly in a river is yin, but when it goes over the waterfall, it's very yang. Toothpicks are yin compared with a telephone pole. The back of a person is more yang than the front. The top of a person is the yang end. Taoism teaches that there is a power in the universe. It's higher, deeper, and truer than any other force. They call it the Tao. It means the way. Like the Force in Star Wars, the Tao has two sides. Unlike other religions where the higher power is all good, and perhaps has an all-evil rival, Taoism teaches that we need to learn from both yin and yang. And unlike religions with gods that are personal, the higher power in Taoism is not. Taoists believe that living in harmony with the way, a person will not have to fight against the universe's natural flow. So, for example, listen more, argue less.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can try to find the one that is closest in terms of the concept of balance.

The ground truth MCQ is about the importance of knowing yin and yang, which is related to the concept of balance in Taoism. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is about the state of balance in chemical reactions, which is the closest concept to the ground truth MCQ.

So, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 2

What's the definition of comedy? Thinkers and philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Hobbes, Freud, and beyond, including anyone misguided enough to try to explain a joke, have pondered it, and no one has settled it. You're lucky you found this video to sort it out. To define comedy, you should first ask why it seems comedy defies definition. The answer's simple. Comedy is the defiance of definition because definitions sometimes need defiance. Consider definition itself. When we define, we use language to set borders around a thing that we've perceived in the whirling chaos of existence. We say what the thing means and fit that in a system of meanings. Chaos becomes cosmos. The universe is translated into a cosmological construct of knowledge. And let's be honest, we need some logical cosmic order, otherwise we'd have pure chaos. Chaos can be rough, so we build a thing that we call reality. Now think about logic and logos, that tight knot connecting a word and truth. And let's jump back to thinking about what's funny, because some people say it's real simple: truth is funny. It's funny because it's true. But that's simplistic. Plenty of lies are funny. Comedic fiction can be funny. Made-up nonsense jibberish is frequently hilarious. For instance, florp -- hysterical! And plenty of truths aren't funny. Two plus two truly equals four, but I'm not laughing just because that's the case. You can tell a true anecdote, but your date may not laugh. So, why are some untruths and only some truths funny? How do these laughable truths and untruths relate to that capital-T Truth, the cosmological reality of facts and definitions? And what makes any of them funny? There's a Frenchman who can help, another thinker who didn't define comedy because he expressly didn't want to. Henri Bergson's a French philosopher who prefaced his essay on laughter by saying he wouldn't define "the comic" because it's a living thing. He argued laughter has a social function to destroy mechanical inelasticity in people's attitudes and behavior. Someone doing the same thing over and over, or building up a false image of themself and the world, or not adapting to reality by just noticing the banana peel on the ground -- this is automatism, ignorance of one's own mindless rigidity, and it's dangerous but also laughable and comic ridicule helps correct it. The comic is a kinetic, vital force, or elan vital, that helps us adapt. Bergson elaborates on this idea to study what's funny about all sorts of things. But let's stay on this. At the base of this concept of comedy is contradiction between vital, adaptive humanity and dehumanized automatism. A set system that claims to define reality might be one of those dehumanizing forces that comedy tends to destroy. Now, let's go back to Aristotle. Not Poetics, where he drops a few thoughts on comedy, no, Metaphysics, the fundamental law of non-contradiction, the bedrock of logic. Contradictory statements are not at the same time true. If A is an axiomatic statement, it can't be the case that A and the opposite of A are both true. Comedy seems to live here, to subsist on the illogic of logical contradiction and its derivatives. We laugh when the order we project on the world is disrupted and disproven, like when the way we all act contradicts truths we don't like talking about, or when strange observations we all make in the silent darkness of private thought are dragged into public by a good stand-up, and when cats play piano, because cats that are also somehow humans disrupt our reality. So, we don't just laugh at truth, we laugh at the pleasurable, edifying revelation of flaws, incongruities, overlaps, and outright conflicts in the supposedly ordered system of truths we use to define the world and ourselves. When we think too highly of our thinking, when we think things are true just because we all say they're logos and stop adapting, we become the butt of jokes played on us by that wacky little trickster, chaos. Comedy conveys that destructive, instructive playfulness, but has no logical definition because it acts upon our logic paralogically from outside its finite borders. Far from having a definite definition, it has an infinite infinition. And the infinition of comedy is that anything can be mined for comedy. Thus, all definitions of reality, especially those that claim to be universal, logical, cosmic, capital-T Truth become laughable.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

A set system that claims to define reality might be one of those dehumanizing forces that comedy tends to destroy. Now, let's go back to Aristotle. Not Poetics, where he drops a few thoughts on comedy, no, Metaphysics, the fundamental law of non-contradiction, the bedrock of logic. Contradictory statements are not at the same time true. If A is an axiomatic statement, it can't be the case that A and the opposite of A are both true. Comedy seems to live here, to subsist on the illogic of logical contradiction and its derivatives. We laugh when the order we project on the world is disrupted and disproven, like when the way we all act contradicts truths we don't like talking about, or when strange observations we all make in the silent darkness of private thought are dragged into public by a good stand-up, and when cats play piano, because cats that are also somehow humans disrupt our reality. So, we don't just laugh at truth, we laugh at the pleasurable, edifying revelation of flaws, incongruities, overlaps, and outright conflicts in the supposedly ordered system of truths we use to define the world and ourselves. When we think too highly of our thinking, when we think things are true just because we all say they're logos and stop adapting, we become the butt of jokes played on us by that wacky little trickster, chaos. Comedy conveys that destructive, instructive playfulness, but has no logical definition because it acts upon our logic paralogically from outside its finite borders. Far from having a definite definition, it has an infinite infinition. And the infinition of comedy is that anything can be mined for comedy. Thus, all definitions of reality, especially those that claim to be universal, logical, cosmic, capital-T Truth become laughable.

What's the definition of comedy? Thinkers and philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Hobbes, Freud, and beyond, including anyone misguided enough to try to explain a joke, have pondered it, and no one has settled it. You're lucky you found this video to sort it out. To define comedy, you should first ask why it seems comedy defies definition. The answer's simple. Comedy is the defiance of definition because definitions sometimes need defiance. Consider definition itself. When we define, we use language to set borders around a thing that we've perceived in the whirling chaos of existence. We say what the thing means and fit that in a system of meanings. Chaos becomes cosmos. The universe is translated into a cosmological construct of knowledge. And let's be honest, we need some logical cosmic order, otherwise we'd have pure chaos. Chaos can be rough, so we build a thing that we call reality. Now think about logic and logos, that tight knot connecting a word and truth. And let's jump back to thinking about what's funny, because some people say it's real simple: truth is funny. It's funny because it's true. But that's simplistic. Plenty of lies are funny. Comedic fiction can be funny. Made-up nonsense jibberish is frequently hilarious. For instance, florp -- hysterical! And plenty of truths aren't funny. Two plus two truly equals four, but I'm not laughing just because that's the case. You can tell a true anecdote, but your date may not laugh. So, why are some untruths and only some truths funny? How do these laughable truths and untruths relate to that capital-T Truth, the cosmological reality of facts and definitions? And what makes any of them funny? There's a Frenchman who can help, another thinker who didn't define comedy because he expressly didn't want to. Henri Bergson's a French philosopher who prefaced his essay on laughter by saying he wouldn't define "the comic" because it's a living thing. He argued laughter has a social function to destroy mechanical inelasticity in people's attitudes and behavior. Someone doing the same thing over and over, or building up a false image of themself and the world, or not adapting to reality by just noticing the banana peel on the ground -- this is automatism, ignorance of one's own mindless rigidity, and it's dangerous but also laughable and comic ridicule helps correct it. The comic is a kinetic, vital force, or elan vital, that helps us adapt. Bergson elaborates on this idea to study what's funny about all sorts of things. But let's stay on this. At the base of this concept of comedy is contradiction between vital, adaptive humanity and dehumanized automatism.

**Transcript**:
Say two people are walking down the street, and they bump into each other. They'll just shake it off and walk on. Sometimes that happens with molecules too. They just bounce off each other, and that's that. But what if two people were to bump into each other, and during that collision, one person's arm got severed and reattached to the other person's face? Now that sounds really weird, but it's similar to one of the many ways that molecules can react with each other. Two molecules can join and become one. One can split apart and become two. Molecules can switch parts. All these changes are chemical reactions, and we can see them happening around us. For example, when fireworks explode, or iron rusts, or milk goes bad, or people are born, grow old, die, and then decompose. But chemical reactions don't just happen willy nilly! Everything has to be right. First, the molecules have to hit each other in the right orientation. And second, they have to hit each other hard enough, in other words, with enough energy. Now you're probably thinking that a reaction just happens in one direction and that's it. Sometimes that's true. For example, things can't unburn or unexplode. But most reactions can happen in both directions, forward and reverse. There's no reason that our face-arm guy can't bump into armless girl, reattaching that arm back to its original socket. Now let's zoom out a bit. Now let's say that you've got a thousand people on the street, and all of them start with their limbs normally attached. At the beginning, every collision is a chance for Person A to transfer an arm to Person B's face. And so at the beginning, more and more people end up with arms attached to their faces or arms missing. But as the number of people with arm-faces and missing arms grows, collisions between those people become more likely. And when they bump into each other, guess what? Normal-appendage people are reproduced. Now the number of limb transfers per second forward will start high and then fall, and the number of limb transfers per second backward will start at zero and then rise. Eventually they'll meet, they'll be the same. And when that happens, the number of people in each state stops changing, even though people are still bumping into each other and exchanging limbs. Now how many people do you think there are in each state? Half and half, right? No, well, maybe. It depends. It could be 50/50, but it could be 60/40 or 15/85, or anything. We chemists have to get our little, gloved hands dirty - ah, well, we're in a lab so not really dirty - to figure out what the actual distribution of molecules is. Even though each of limb transfers is a pretty dramatic event for the people involved, if we zoom out, we see population numbers that don't change. We call this nirvana equilibrium, and it doesn't just happen with chemical reactions. Things like gene pools and highway traffic show the same pattern. It looks pretty still from 30,000 feet, but there is lots of crazy stuff happening on the ground, you just need to zoom in to see it.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is/are the requirement(s) for a collision to result in a reaction?
Options: A. Both proper orientation and enough energy, B. Only proper orientation, C. Only enough energy, D. Either proper orientation or enough energy

Everything has to be right. First, the molecules have to hit each other in the right orientation. And second, they have to hit each other hard enough, in other words, with enough energy. Now you're probably thinking that a reaction just happens in one direction and that's it. Sometimes that's true. For example, things can't unburn or unexplode. But most reactions can happen in both directions, forward and reverse. There's no reason that our face-arm guy can't bump into armless girl, reattaching that arm back to its original socket. Now let's zoom out a bit. Now let's say that you've got a thousand people on the street, and all of them start with their limbs normally attached. At the beginning, every collision is a chance for Person A to transfer an arm to Person B's face. And so at the beginning, more and more people end up with arms attached to their faces or arms missing. But as the number of people with arm-faces and missing arms grows, collisions between those people become more likely. And when they bump into each other, guess what? Normal-appendage people are reproduced. Now the number of limb transfers per second forward will start high and then fall, and the number of limb transfers per second backward will start at zero and then rise. Eventually they'll meet, they'll be the same. And when that happens, the number of people in each state stops changing, even though people are still bumping into each other and exchanging limbs. Now how many people do you think there are in each state? Half and half, right? No, well, maybe. It depends. It could be 50/50, but it could be 60/40 or 15/85, or anything. We chemists have to get our little, gloved hands dirty - ah, well, we're in a lab so not really dirty - to figure out what the actual distribution of molecules is. Even though each of limb transfers is a pretty dramatic event for the people involved, if we zoom out, we see population numbers that don't change. We call this nirvana equilibrium, and it doesn't just happen with chemical reactions. Things like gene pools and highway traffic show the same pattern. It looks pretty still from 30,000 feet, but there is lots of crazy stuff happening on the ground, you just need to zoom in to see it.

**Transcript**:
Say two people are walking down the street, and they bump into each other. They'll just shake it off and walk on. Sometimes that happens with molecules too. They just bounce off each other, and that's that. But what if two people were to bump into each other, and during that collision, one person's arm got severed and reattached to the other person's face? Now that sounds really weird, but it's similar to one of the many ways that molecules can react with each other. Two molecules can join and become one. One can split apart and become two. Molecules can switch parts. All these changes are chemical reactions, and we can see them happening around us. For example, when fireworks explode, or iron rusts, or milk goes bad, or people are born, grow old, die, and then decompose. But chemical reactions don't just happen willy nilly!

**Transcript**:
There are a lot of ways this marvelous language of ours, English, doesn't make sense. For example, most of the time when we talk about more
than one of something, we put an S on the end. One cat, two cats. But then, there's that handful of words where things work differently. Alone you have a man; if he has company, then you've got men, or probably better for him, women too. Although if there were only one of them, it would be a woman. Or if there's more than one goose, they're geese, but why not lots of mooses, meese? Or if you have two feet, then why don't you read two beek instead of books. The fact is that if you
were speaking English before about a thousand years ago, beek is exactly what you would have said for more than one book. If Modern English is strange, Old English needed therapy. Believe it or not, English used to be an even harder language to learn than it is today. Twenty-five hundred years ago, English and German were the same language. They drifted apart slowly, little by little becoming
more and more different. That meant that in early English, just like in German, inanimate objects had gender. A fork, gafol, was a woman; a spoon, laefel, was a man; and the table they were on, bord, was neither, also called neuter. Go figure! Being able to use words meant not just knowing their meaning but what gender they were, too. And while today there
are only about a dozen plurals that don't make sense, like men and geese, in Old English, it was perfectly normal for countless plurals to be like that. You think it's odd that more
than one goose is geese? Well, imagine if more than one goat was a bunch of gat, or if more than one oak tree was a field of ack. To be able to talk about any of these, you just had to know the exact
word for their plural rather than just adding
the handy S on the end. And it wasn't always
an S at the end either. In merry Old English, they could add other sounds to the end. Just like more than one child is children, more than one lamb was lambru, you fried up your eggru, and people talked not about breads, but breadru. Sometimes it was like sheep is today - where, to make a plural,
you don't do anything. One sheep, two sheep. In Old English, one house, two house. And just like today, we have
oxen instead of oxes. Old English people had
toungen instead of tongues, namen instead of names, and if things stayed the way they were, today we would have eyen instead of eyes. So, why didn't things
stay the way they were? In a word, Vikings. In the 8th century, Scandinavian marauders started taking over much of England. They didn't speak English, they spoke Norse. Plus, they were grown-ups, and grown-ups aren't as good at learning languages as children. After the age of roughly 15, it's almost impossible
to learn a new language without an accent and without slipping up here and there as we all know from what language
classes are like. The Vikings were no different, so they had a way of smoothing away the harder parts of how English worked. Part of that was those crazy plurals. Imagine running up against a language with eggru and gat on the one hand, and then with other words, all you have to do is add 's' and get days and stones. Wouldn't it make things easier to just use the 's' for everything? That's how the Vikings felt too. And there were so many of them, and they married so
many of the English women, that pretty soon, if you
grew up in England, you heard streamlined English
as much as the real kind. After a while nobody remembered
the real kind any more. Nobody remembered that once you said doora instead of doors and handa instead of hands. Plurals made a lot more sense now, except for a few hold-outs like children and teeth that get used so much that it was hard to break the habit. The lesson is that English makes a lot
more sense than you think. Thank the ancestors of people in Copenhagen and Oslo for the fact that today we don't ask
for a handful of pea-night instead of peanuts. Although, wouldn't it be fun, if for just a week or two, we could?

**Transcript**:
Take a moment to read the following. How was that? Frustrating? Slow? What were those sentences about? They're actually a simulation of the experience of dyslexia, designed to make you decode each word. Those with dyslexia experience
that laborious pace every time they read. When most people think of dyslexia, they think of seeing letters
and words backwards, like seeing "b" as "d" and vice versa, or they might think people with dyslexia see "saw" as "was". The truth is people with dyslexia see things the same way as everyone else. Dyslexia is caused by a phonological
processing problem, meaning people affected by it have trouble not with seeing language but with manipulating it. For example, if you heard the word cat and then someone asked
you, "Remove the 'c'," what word would you have left? At. This can be difficult
for those with dyslexia. Given a word in isolation, like fantastic, students with dyslexia
need to break the word into parts to read it: fan, tas, tic. Time spent decoding makes it hard to keep up with peers and gain sufficient comprehension. Spelling words phonetically, like s-t-i-k for stick and f-r-e-n-s for friends is also common. These difficulties are more
widespread and varied than commonly imagined. Dyslexia affects up to one in five people. It occurs on a continuum. One person might have mild dyslexia while the next person has
a profound case of it. Dyslexia also runs in families. It's common to see one family member who has trouble spelling while another family member has severe difficulty decoding
even one syllable words, like catch. The continuum and distribution of dyslexia suggests a broader
principle to bear in mind as we look at how the brains
of those with dyslexia process language. Neurodiversity is the idea that because all our brains
show differences in structure and function, we shouldn't be so quick to label every deviation from "the norm" as a pathological disorder or dismiss people living
with these variations as "defective." People with neurobiological
variations like dyslexia, including such creative
and inventive individuals as Picasso, Muhammad Ali, Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, and Cher, clearly have every capacity to be brilliant and successful in life. So, here's the special way the brains of those with dyslexia work. The brain is divided into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is generally
in charge of language and, ultimately, reading, while the right typically
handles spatial activities. fMRI studies have found that the brains of those with dyslexia rely more on the right
hemisphere and frontal lobe than the brains of those without it. This means, when they read a word, it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe. Because of this neurobiological glitch, they read with more difficulty. But those with dyslexia can physically change their brain and improve their reading with an intensive,
multi-sensory intervention that breaks the language down and teaches the reader to decode based on syllable types
and spelling rules. The brains of those with dyslexia begin using the left hemisphere more efficiently while reading, and their reading improves. The intervention works because it locates dyslexia appropriately as a functional variation in the brain, which, naturally, shows

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the northern and southern lights, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about dyslexia.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ at all, but if I had to choose one that is somewhat similar in structure, I would say Question 5, but this is a very weak match and I do not think it is a good match at all.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are actually related to the topic of dyslexia and match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If you want, I can try to generate new MCQs that match the ground truth MCQ.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 17, Question 2
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Take a moment to read the following. How was that? Frustrating? Slow? What were those sentences about? They're actually a simulation of the experience of dyslexia, designed to make you decode each word. Those with dyslexia experience
that laborious pace every time they read. When most people think of dyslexia, they think of seeing letters
and words backwards, like seeing "b" as "d" and vice versa, or they might think people with dyslexia see "saw" as "was". The truth is people with dyslexia see things the same way as everyone else. Dyslexia is caused by a phonological
processing problem, meaning people affected by it have trouble not with seeing language but with manipulating it. For example, if you heard the word cat and then someone asked
you, "Remove the 'c'," what word would you have left? At. This can be difficult
for those with dyslexia. Given a word in isolation, like fantastic, students with dyslexia
need to break the word into parts to read it: fan, tas, tic. Time spent decoding makes it hard to keep up with peers and gain sufficient comprehension. Spelling words phonetically, like s-t-i-k for stick and f-r-e-n-s for friends is also common. These difficulties are more
widespread and varied than commonly imagined. Dyslexia affects up to one in five people. It occurs on a continuum. One person might have mild dyslexia while the next person has
a profound case of it. Dyslexia also runs in families. It's common to see one family member who has trouble spelling while another family member has severe difficulty decoding
even one syllable words, like catch. The continuum and distribution of dyslexia suggests a broader
principle to bear in mind as we look at how the brains
of those with dyslexia process language. Neurodiversity is the idea that because all our brains
show differences in structure and function, we shouldn't be so quick to label every deviation from "the norm" as a pathological disorder or dismiss people living
with these variations as "defective." People with neurobiological
variations like dyslexia, including such creative
and inventive individuals as Picasso, Muhammad Ali, Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, and Cher, clearly have every capacity to be brilliant and successful in life. So, here's the special way the brains of those with dyslexia work. The brain is divided into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is generally
in charge of language and, ultimately, reading, while the right typically
handles spatial activities. fMRI studies have found that the brains of those with dyslexia rely more on the right
hemisphere and frontal lobe than the brains of those without it. This means, when they read a word, it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe. Because of this neurobiological glitch, they read with more difficulty. But those with dyslexia can physically change their brain and improve their reading with an intensive,
multi-sensory intervention that breaks the language down and teaches the reader to decode based on syllable types
and spelling rules. The brains of those with dyslexia begin using the left hemisphere more efficiently while reading, and their reading improves. The intervention works because it locates dyslexia appropriately as a functional variation in the brain, which, naturally, shows
all sorts of variations from one person to another. Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum of brain function in all humans and suggests that to better
understand the perspectives of those around us, we should try not only to see
the world through their eyes but understand it through their brains.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the northern and southern lights, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about dyslexia.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. This is because Question 5 is a simple question with two possible answers (although it has four options, the question itself is a simple yes/no type question), similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But please note that this is a very weak match, and the actual content and intent of the question are completely different.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (or 5, if we consider only the format and structure)

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Try to measure a circle. The diameter and radius are easy, they're just straight lines you can measure with a ruler. But to get the circumference, you'd need measuring tape
or a piece of string, unless there was a better way. Now, it's obvious that a circle's circumference
would get smaller or larger along with its diameter, but the relationship
goes further than that. In fact, the ratio between the two, the circumference divided by the diameter, will always be the same number, no matter how big
or small the circle gets. Historians aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered, but it's been known in some form for almost 4,000 years. Estimates of it appear
in the works of ancient Greek, Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian mathematicians. And it's even believed to have been used in building the Egyptian pyramids. Mathematicians estimated it by inscribing polygons in circles. And by the year 1400, it had been calculated to as far
as ten decimal places. So, when did they finally
figure out the exact value instead of just estimating? Actually, never! You see, the ratio of a circle's circumference
to its diameter is what's known as an irrational number, one that can never be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers. You can come close, but no matter how precise the fraction is, it will always be just a tiny bit off. So, to write it out in its decimal form, you'd have an on-going series of digits starting with 3.14159 and continuing forever! That's why, instead of trying to write out an infinite number of digits every time, we just refer to it using
the Greek letter pi. Nowadays, we test the speed of computers by having them calculate pi, and quantum computers have been able to calculate it
up to two quadrillion digits. People even compete to see how many digits they can memorize and have set records for remembering over 67,000 of them. But for most scientific uses, you only need the first forty or so. And what are these scientific uses? Well, just about any calculations
involving circles, from the volume of a can of soda to the orbits of satellites. And it's not just circles, either. Because it's also useful
in studying curves, pi helps us understand periodic
or oscillating systems like clocks, electromagnetic waves, and even music. In statistics, pi is used in the equation to calculate the area
under a normal distribution curve, which comes in handy
for figuring out distributions of standardized test scores, financial models, or margins of error in scientific results. As if that weren't enough, pi is used in particle
physics experiments, such as those using
the Large Hadron Collider, not only due to its round shape, but more subtly, because of the orbits
in which tiny particles move. Scientists have even used pi to prove the illusive notion that light functions as both a particle and an electromagnetic wave, and, perhaps most impressively, to calculate the density
of our entire universe, which, by the way, still has infinitely less stuff in it than the total number of digits in pi.

to its diameter is what's known as an irrational number, one that can never be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers. You can come close, but no matter how precise the fraction is, it will always be just a tiny bit off. So, to write it out in its decimal form, you'd have an on-going series of digits starting with 3.14159 and continuing forever! That's why, instead of trying to write out an infinite number of digits every time, we just refer to it using
the Greek letter pi. Nowadays, we test the speed of computers by having them calculate pi, and quantum computers have been able to calculate it
up to two quadrillion digits. People even compete to see how many digits they can memorize and have set records for remembering over 67,000 of them. But for most scientific uses, you only need the first forty or so. And what are these scientific uses? Well, just about any calculations
involving circles, from the volume of a can of soda to the orbits of satellites. And it's not just circles, either. Because it's also useful
in studying curves, pi helps us understand periodic
or oscillating systems like clocks, electromagnetic waves, and even music. In statistics, pi is used in the equation to calculate the area
under a normal distribution curve, which comes in handy
for figuring out distributions of standardized test scores, financial models, or margins of error in scientific results. As if that weren't enough, pi is used in particle
physics experiments, such as those using
the Large Hadron Collider, not only due to its round shape, but more subtly, because of the orbits
in which tiny particles move. Scientists have even used pi to prove the illusive notion that light functions as both a particle and an electromagnetic wave, and, perhaps most impressively, to calculate the density
of our entire universe, which, by the way, still has infinitely less stuff in it than the total number of digits in pi.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to computer architecture and programming, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the uses of pi.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is vaguely similar in terms of being a multiple-choice question, I would say Question 1, but this is a very weak match and not a good one.

However, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, options, or intent.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Commas are tricky things, especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved. If you can remember a few basic rules, a simple law of physics, and some common scenarios, you will be able to use commas correctly. I like to think of the different parts of our sentence as characters. Let's meet a few of them: the tiny conjunctions, the mighty subordinates, and the clever comma. Conjunctions are small and nimble. They are words that connect clauses, words, and phrases. You can easily remember the conjunctions by remembering the acronym FANBOYS. The conjunctions are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. Because they're so small, more often than not, they require the help of a comma but not always. Subordinates, on the other hand, are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They are words that connect
two unequal things, dependent and independent clauses. Subordinates make it very clear what is being prioritized in a sentence. Commonly used subordinates are although, because, before, however, unless, and even though. Because subordinates are all about power, they can do a lot of heavy
lifting by themselves. But, of course, sometimes
even the strongest among us needs some help from our clever friends. Because our clever comma is so nice, she often roams her neighborhood looking for some community service to do. Today, as soon as she leaves her house, she sees a subordinate lifting the weight of two complete sentences, one on each arm. Bartheleme loves engaging
in political debate even though he usually loses. The comma asks the subordinate
if he needs help. Well, we know that subordinates are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They can easily hold the weight of these two complete sentences because they are distributed
evenly on both arms. So, when the comma asks if it can help, the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance. No thanks, maybe next time! So, the comma continues on. Soon, she seems a couple of subordinates attempting to lift the weight of sentences directly
in front of themselves. Even though Bartheleme loves to sing, he never sings in front of others. The comma asks the subordinates
if they need help. They might not want to admit it, but this time the subordinates
do need help. Complete sentences weigh quite a bit. Simple physics tells us that it's easier to balance heavy objects if the weight is evenly distributed. So, while the subordinates
are quite capable of balancing two complete sentences when carrying the weight on both sides, they're having trouble
picking just one up. The comma rushes over to help the struggling subordinates, but how will she help? When subordinates begin sentences, the comma will place herself directly after the first
thought or complete sentence. After helping the subordinates, our comma heroine continues on and spots a conjunction holding the weight
of two complete sentences. Bartheleme was accepted
into the University of Chicago, and he is on the waitlist
for Stanford University. The comma asks the conjunction
if he needs help. Of course he does! Hurry! The comma rushes and places
itself before the conjunction. Fanboys aren't as militant
as subordinates. For this reason, the commas don't have to fall
in line behind the fanboys. Fanboys are courteous creatures. They allow the comma to go ahead of them. Helping others is hard work! On her way home, our comma sees a conjunction
holding up the weight of a complete sentence and a fragment sentence. Bartheleme is going to major
in molecular biology or interpretive dance. The now-exhausted comma
asks the conjunction if he needs help lifting the items. This is one of the rare occassions where a conjunction doesn't
need the help of a comma. The conjunction assures the comma that help isn't needed, which is good for the comma because by now, all it wants to do is go home and rest up for another day of vigilant
sentence constructing.

**Transcript**:
Commas are tricky things, especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved. If you can remember a few basic rules, a simple law of physics, and some common scenarios, you will be able to use commas correctly. I like to think of the different parts of our sentence as characters. Let's meet a few of them: the tiny conjunctions, the mighty subordinates, and the clever comma. Conjunctions are small and nimble. They are words that connect clauses, words, and phrases. You can easily remember the conjunctions by remembering the acronym FANBOYS. The conjunctions are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. Because they're so small, more often than not, they require the help of a comma but not always. Subordinates, on the other hand, are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They are words that connect
two unequal things, dependent and independent clauses. Subordinates make it very clear what is being prioritized in a sentence. Commonly used subordinates are although, because, before, however, unless, and even though. Because subordinates are all about power, they can do a lot of heavy
lifting by themselves. But, of course, sometimes
even the strongest among us needs some help from our clever friends. Because our clever comma is so nice, she often roams her neighborhood looking for some community service to do. Today, as soon as she leaves her house, she sees a subordinate lifting the weight of two complete sentences, one on each arm. Bartheleme loves engaging
in political debate even though he usually loses. The comma asks the subordinate
if he needs help. Well, we know that subordinates are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They can easily hold the weight of these two complete sentences because they are distributed
evenly on both arms. So, when the comma asks if it can help, the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance. No thanks, maybe next time! So, the comma continues on. Soon, she seems a couple of subordinates attempting to lift the weight of sentences directly
in front of themselves. Even though Bartheleme loves to sing, he never sings in front of others. The comma asks the subordinates
if they need help. They might not want to admit it, but this time the subordinates
do need help. Complete sentences weigh quite a bit. Simple physics tells us that it's easier to balance heavy objects if the weight is evenly distributed. So, while the subordinates
are quite capable of balancing two complete sentences when carrying the weight on both sides, they're having trouble
picking just one up. The comma rushes over to help the struggling subordinates, but how will she help? When subordinates begin sentences, the comma will place herself directly after the first
thought or complete sentence. After helping the subordinates, our comma heroine continues on and spots a conjunction holding the weight
of two complete sentences. Bartheleme was accepted
into the University of Chicago, and he is on the waitlist
for Stanford University. The comma asks the conjunction
if he needs help. Of course he does! Hurry! The comma rushes and places
itself before the conjunction. Fanboys aren't as militant
as subordinates. For this reason, the commas don't have to fall
in line behind the fanboys. Fanboys are courteous creatures. They allow the comma to go ahead of them. Helping others is hard work! On her way home, our comma sees a conjunction
holding up the weight of a complete sentence and a fragment sentence. Bartheleme is going to major
in molecular biology or interpretive dance. The now-exhausted comma
asks the conjunction if he needs help lifting the items. This is one of the rare occassions where a conjunction doesn't
need the help of a comma. The conjunction assures the comma that help isn't needed, which is good for the comma because by now, all it wants to do is go home and rest up for another day of vigilant
sentence constructing.

**Transcript**:
Every second, one million tons of matter
is blasted from the Sun at the velocity
of one million miles per hour, and it's on a collision course with Earth! But don't worry, this isn't the opening
of a new Michael Bay movie. This is The Journey of the Polar Lights. The northern and southern lights,
also known as the aurora Borealis and aurora Australis, respectively, occur when high energy
particles from the Sun collide with neutral atoms
in our atmosphere. The energy emitted from this crash
produces a spectacle of light that mankind has marveled at
for centuries. But the particles' journey
isn't just as simple as leaving the Sun and arriving at Earth. Like any cross-country road trip,
there's a big detour and nobody asks for directions. Let's track this intergalactic voyage by focusing on three
main points of their journey: leaving the Sun, making a pit stop
in the Earth's magnetic fields, and arriving at the atmosphere
above our heads. The protons and electrons
creating the northern lights depart from the Sun's corona. The corona is the outermost layer
of the Sun's atmosphere and is one of the hottest regions. Its intense heat causes the Sun's hydrogen
and helium atoms to vibrate and shake off protons and electrons as if they were stripping off
layers on a hot, sunny day. Impatient and finally behind the wheel, these free protons
and electrons move too fast to be contained by the Sun's gravity and group together as plasma,
an electrically charged gas. They travel away from the Sun
as a constant gale of plasma, known as the solar wind. However, the Earth prevents the solar wind
from traveling straight into the planet by setting up a detour, the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is formed
by the Earth's magnetic currents and shields our planet
from the solar winds by sending out the particles
around the Earth. Their opportunity to continue the journey
down to the atmosphere comes when the magnetosphere is
overwhelmed by a new wave of travelers. This event is coronal mass ejection, and it occurs when the Sun shoots out a massive ball of plasma
into the solar wind. When one of these coronal mass ejections
collides with Earth, it overpowers the magnetosphere
and creates a magnetic storm. The heavy storm stresses the magnetosphere
until it suddenly snaps back, like and overstretched elastic band, flinging some of the detoured
particles towards Earth. The retracting band of the magnetic field
drags them down to the aurora ovals, which are the locations
of the northern and southern lights. After traveling 93 million miles
across the galaxy, the Sun's particles finally produce
their dazzling light show with the help of some friends. 20 to 200 miles above the surface, the electrons and protons meet up
with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and they sure are happy to see each other. The Sun's particles high five the atoms,
giving their energy to the Earth's neutral
oxygen and nitrogen atoms. When the atoms in the atmosphere
are contacted by the particles, they get excited and emit photons. Photons are small bursts of energy
in the form of light. The colors that appear in the sky depend on the wavelength
of the atom's photon. Excited oxygen atoms are responsible
for the green and red colors, whereas excited nitrogen atoms
produce blue and deep red hues. The collection of these interactions is what creates the northern
and southern lights. The polar lights
are best seen on clear nights in regions close to magnetic
north and south poles. Nighttime is ideal because the Aurora
is much dimmer than sunlight and cannot be seen in daytime. Remember to look up at the sky
and read up on the Sun's energy patterns, specifically sunspots and solar flares, as these will be good guides
for predicting the auroras.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the shield around the Earth that captures charged particles, and the correct option is Magnetosphere.

The generated MCQs are unrelated to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say it's Question 2, which is about Newton's Second Law of Motion. However, this question is still unrelated to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say it's Question 2 (Index 2), but please note that this is a very weak match.

In reality, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new generated MCQ that is more relevant to the topic should be created. 

A more suitable generated MCQ would be something like:

Question: What is the region around the Earth that protects it from charged particles from the Sun?
Options: A. Atmosphere, B. Magnetosphere, C. Ozone layer, D. Stratosphere
Correct Option: B

This generated MCQ is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Every second, one million tons of matter
is blasted from the Sun at the velocity
of one million miles per hour, and it's on a collision course with Earth! But don't worry, this isn't the opening
of a new Michael Bay movie. This is The Journey of the Polar Lights. The northern and southern lights,
also known as the aurora Borealis and aurora Australis, respectively, occur when high energy
particles from the Sun collide with neutral atoms
in our atmosphere. The energy emitted from this crash
produces a spectacle of light that mankind has marveled at
for centuries. But the particles' journey
isn't just as simple as leaving the Sun and arriving at Earth. Like any cross-country road trip,
there's a big detour and nobody asks for directions. Let's track this intergalactic voyage by focusing on three
main points of their journey: leaving the Sun, making a pit stop
in the Earth's magnetic fields, and arriving at the atmosphere
above our heads. The protons and electrons
creating the northern lights depart from the Sun's corona. The corona is the outermost layer
of the Sun's atmosphere and is one of the hottest regions. Its intense heat causes the Sun's hydrogen
and helium atoms to vibrate and shake off protons and electrons as if they were stripping off
layers on a hot, sunny day. Impatient and finally behind the wheel, these free protons
and electrons move too fast to be contained by the Sun's gravity and group together as plasma,
an electrically charged gas. They travel away from the Sun
as a constant gale of plasma, known as the solar wind. However, the Earth prevents the solar wind
from traveling straight into the planet by setting up a detour, the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is formed
by the Earth's magnetic currents and shields our planet
from the solar winds by sending out the particles
around the Earth. Their opportunity to continue the journey
down to the atmosphere comes when the magnetosphere is
overwhelmed by a new wave of travelers. This event is coronal mass ejection, and it occurs when the Sun shoots out a massive ball of plasma
into the solar wind. When one of these coronal mass ejections
collides with Earth, it overpowers the magnetosphere
and creates a magnetic storm. The heavy storm stresses the magnetosphere
until it suddenly snaps back, like and overstretched elastic band, flinging some of the detoured
particles towards Earth. The retracting band of the magnetic field
drags them down to the aurora ovals, which are the locations
of the northern and southern lights. After traveling 93 million miles
across the galaxy, the Sun's particles finally produce
their dazzling light show with the help of some friends. 20 to 200 miles above the surface, the electrons and protons meet up
with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and they sure are happy to see each other. The Sun's particles high five the atoms,
giving their energy to the Earth's neutral
oxygen and nitrogen atoms. When the atoms in the atmosphere
are contacted by the particles, they get excited and emit photons. Photons are small bursts of energy
in the form of light. The colors that appear in the sky depend on the wavelength
of the atom's photon. Excited oxygen atoms are responsible
for the green and red colors, whereas excited nitrogen atoms
produce blue and deep red hues. The collection of these interactions is what creates the northern
and southern lights. The polar lights
are best seen on clear nights in regions close to magnetic
north and south poles. Nighttime is ideal because the Aurora
is much dimmer than sunlight and cannot be seen in daytime. Remember to look up at the sky
and read up on the Sun's energy patterns, specifically sunspots and solar flares, as these will be good guides
for predicting the auroras.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the area of the sun that shoots out particles that head towards Earth. The correct answer is Corona.

Among the generated MCQs, none of them are related to the sun or its structure. However, I will choose the one that is least dissimilar in terms of being related to physics or natural phenomena.

The least dissimilar generated MCQ is Question 2, which is related to Newton's Second Law of Motion. However, it is still not similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose 2, but with the caveat that it is still not a good match.

It would be more accurate to say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of generated MCQs should be created that are more relevant to the topic of the transcript.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed how the full moon looks bigger when it's near the horizon than when it's high over head? If so, you're not alone. People have wondered about this strange effect since ancient times, and surprisingly, we still don't have a great explanation, but that's not for lack of trying. Some of the greatest minds in history - Aristotle, Ptolemy, Da Vinci, Decartes - have all wrestled with this problem and failed to generate an adequate explanation. One of the first ideas suggested was that the image of the moon in the sky really is bigger near the horizon. Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a giant lens, magnifying the moon as it rises and sets. But this explanation doesn't cut it. If anything, the refraction of the atmosphere would make the moon look slightly smaller. Plus, if you actually measure the size of the visible moon at different positions, it doesn't change at all. But then, why does it still seem bigger when it's rising? This must be some kind of optical illusion. The question is, which one? One explanation is the Ebbinghaus Illusion, where two identical objects look different because of the relative size of the objects they're surrounded by. Here the two center circles are actually the same size. Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon because it's next to tiny trees, houses, and towers in the distance. But when the moon is higher up, it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky and looks tiny by comparison. Another possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion. If you've ever tried to draw in perspective, you know that the closer something is to the horizon, the smaller you should draw it. Our brain compensates automatically for this by perceiving objects near the horizon as larger than they actually appear. The two yellow lines in this drawing are the same size, but the upper one seems bigger because we interpret it as receding farther into the horizon. So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus, it seems like we've solved the mystery of the moon illusion, but, unfortunately, there are a few details that complicate things. For one thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect, then we would expect the moon illusion to disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds since there wouldn't be any other smaller objects near the horizon. But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion. On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting the size of objects near the horizon, then we'd expect the moon illusion to be visible inside a planetarium, where the whole sky, including the horizon, is displayed on a spherical dome overhead. Studies have shown, though, that this is not the case. To make matters worse, it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely if you just bend over and look at the moon between your legs. Now, this is just getting ridiculous! One of the most promising explanations today is known as Convergence Micropsia. Our brains judge the distance to objects and their apparent size by the focus of our eyes. When looking at the horizon, your eyes focus far off into the distance so your brain knows you're looking far away. The moon appears a certain size. Your brain thinks it's far away, which it is, so you naturally conclude the moon must be big. But when looking up at the night sky, there's nothing for your eyes to focus on, so they default to their rest focus, which is a point just a few meters away. Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer than it really is, so you naturally conclude the moon's not as big as you thought it was. Rather than explain why the moon looks so big near the horizon, Convergence Microspia explains why the moon looks so small when overhead. Still not satisfied? Well, frankly, neither are many scientists, so the debate over the moon illusion still rages on and may continue as long as we still see it in the night sky.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is the moon illusion?

But then, why does it still seem bigger when it's rising? This must be some kind of optical illusion. The question is, which one? One explanation is the Ebbinghaus Illusion, where two identical objects look different because of the relative size of the objects they're surrounded by. Here the two center circles are actually the same size. Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon because it's next to tiny trees, houses, and towers in the distance. But when the moon is higher up, it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky and looks tiny by comparison. Another possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion. If you've ever tried to draw in perspective, you know that the closer something is to the horizon, the smaller you should draw it. Our brain compensates automatically for this by perceiving objects near the horizon as larger than they actually appear. The two yellow lines in this drawing are the same size, but the upper one seems bigger because we interpret it as receding farther into the horizon. So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus, it seems like we've solved the mystery of the moon illusion, but, unfortunately, there are a few details that complicate things. For one thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect, then we would expect the moon illusion to disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds since there wouldn't be any other smaller objects near the horizon. But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion. On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting the size of objects near the horizon, then we'd expect the moon illusion to be visible inside a planetarium, where the whole sky, including the horizon, is displayed on a spherical dome overhead. Studies have shown, though, that this is not the case. To make matters worse, it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely if you just bend over and look at the moon between your legs. Now, this is just getting ridiculous! One of the most promising explanations today is known as Convergence Micropsia. Our brains judge the distance to objects and their apparent size by the focus of our eyes. When looking at the horizon, your eyes focus far off into the distance so your brain knows you're looking far away. The moon appears a certain size. Your brain thinks it's far away, which it is, so you naturally conclude the moon must be big. But when looking up at the night sky, there's nothing for your eyes to focus on, so they default to their rest focus, which is a point just a few meters away. Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer than it really is, so you naturally conclude the moon's not as big as you thought it was. Rather than explain why the moon looks so big near the horizon, Convergence Microspia explains why the moon looks so small when overhead. Still not satisfied? Well, frankly, neither are many scientists, so the debate over the moon illusion still rages on and may continue as long as we still see it in the night sky.

Have you ever noticed how the full moon looks bigger when it's near the horizon than when it's high over head? If so, you're not alone. People have wondered about this strange effect since ancient times, and surprisingly, we still don't have a great explanation, but that's not for lack of trying. Some of the greatest minds in history - Aristotle, Ptolemy, Da Vinci, Decartes - have all wrestled with this problem and failed to generate an adequate explanation. One of the first ideas suggested was that the image of the moon in the sky really is bigger near the horizon. Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a giant lens, magnifying the moon as it rises and sets. But this explanation doesn't cut it.

**Transcript**:
Have you experienced déjà vu? It's that shadowy feeling you get
when a situation seems familiar. A scene in a restaurant plays out
exactly as you remember. The world moves like a ballet
you've choreographed, but the sequence can't be based
on a past experience because you've never eaten here before. This is the first time you've had clams, so what's going on? Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation for déjà vu. The experience is brief
and occurs without notice, making it nearly impossible
for scientists to record and study it. Scientists can't simply sit around
and wait for it to happen to them -- this could take years. It has no physical manifestations and in studies, it's described by the subject
as a sensation or feeling. Because of this lack of hard evidence, there's been a surplus
of speculation over the years. Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu as a French term meaning "already seen," more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon. Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging
and cognitive psychology narrow down the field of prospects. Let's walk through three of today's
more prevalent theories, using the same
restaurant setting for each. First up is dual processing. We'll need an action. Let's go with a waiter
dropping a tray of dishes. As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres process
a flurry of information: the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell of pasta. Within milliseconds, this information
zips through pathways and is processed into a single moment. Most of the time,
everything is recorded in-sync. However, this theory asserts that déjà vu occurs
when there's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways. The difference in arrival times causes the brain to interpret
the late information as a separate event. When it plays
over the already-recorded moment, it feels as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has. Our next theory deals
with a confusion of the past rather than a mistake in the present. This is the hologram theory, and we'll use that tablecloth
to examine it. As you scan its squares, a distant memory swims up
from deep within your brain. According to the theory, this is because memories are stored in the form of holograms, and in holograms, you only need one fragment
to see the whole picture. Your brain has identified the tablecloth
with one from the past, maybe from your grandmother's house. However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's, your brain has summoned up the old memory without identifying it. This leaves you stuck with familiarity,
but no recollection. Although you've never been
in this restaurant, you've seen that tablecloth
but are just failing to identify it. Now, look at this fork. Are you paying attention? Our last theory is divided attention, and it states that déjà vu occurs when our brain subliminally
takes in an environment while we're distracted
by one particular object. When our attention returns, we feel as if we've been here before. For example, just now
you focused on the fork and didn't observe the tablecloth
or the falling waiter. Although your brain has been
recording everything in your peripheral vision, it's been doing so
below conscious awareness. When you finally pull yourself
away from the fork, you think you've been here before
because you have, you just weren't paying attention. While all three of these theories
share the common features of déjà vu, none of them propose to be
the conclusive source of the phenomenon. Still, while we wait
for researchers and inventers to come up with new ways
to capture this fleeting moment, we can study the moment ourselves. After all, most studies of déjà vu
are based on first-hand accounts, so why can't one be yours? The next time you get déjà vu,
take a moment to think about it. Have you been distracted? Is there a familiar object somewhere? Is your brain just acting slow? Or is it something else?

**Transcript**:
Have you experienced déjà vu? It's that shadowy feeling you get
when a situation seems familiar. A scene in a restaurant plays out
exactly as you remember. The world moves like a ballet
you've choreographed, but the sequence can't be based
on a past experience because you've never eaten here before. This is the first time you've had clams, so what's going on? Unfortunately, there isn't
one single explanation for déjà vu. The experience is brief
and occurs without notice, making it nearly impossible
for scientists to record and study it. Scientists can't simply sit around
and wait for it to happen to them -- this could take years. It has no physical manifestations and in studies, it's described by the subject
as a sensation or feeling. Because of this lack of hard evidence, there's been a surplus
of speculation over the years. Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu as a French term meaning "already seen," more than 40 theories attempt
to explain this phenomenon. Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging
and cognitive psychology narrow down the field of prospects. Let's walk through three of today's
more prevalent theories, using the same
restaurant setting for each. First up is dual processing. We'll need an action. Let's go with a waiter
dropping a tray of dishes. As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres process
a flurry of information: the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell of pasta. Within milliseconds, this information
zips through pathways and is processed into a single moment. Most of the time,
everything is recorded in-sync. However, this theory asserts that déjà vu occurs
when there's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways. The difference in arrival times causes the brain to interpret
the late information as a separate event. When it plays
over the already-recorded moment, it feels as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has. Our next theory deals
with a confusion of the past rather than a mistake in the present. This is the hologram theory, and we'll use that tablecloth
to examine it. As you scan its squares, a distant memory swims up
from deep within your brain. According to the theory, this is because memories are stored in the form of holograms, and in holograms, you only need one fragment
to see the whole picture. Your brain has identified the tablecloth
with one from the past, maybe from your grandmother's house. However, instead of remembering
that you've seen it at your grandmother's, your brain has summoned up the old memory without identifying it. This leaves you stuck with familiarity,
but no recollection. Although you've never been
in this restaurant, you've seen that tablecloth
but are just failing to identify it. Now, look at this fork. Are you paying attention? Our last theory is divided attention, and it states that déjà vu occurs when our brain subliminally
takes in an environment while we're distracted
by one particular object. When our attention returns, we feel as if we've been here before. For example, just now
you focused on the fork and didn't observe the tablecloth
or the falling waiter. Although your brain has been
recording everything in your peripheral vision, it's been doing so
below conscious awareness. When you finally pull yourself
away from the fork, you think you've been here before
because you have, you just weren't paying attention. While all three of these theories
share the common features of déjà vu, none of them propose to be
the conclusive source of the phenomenon. Still, while we wait
for researchers and inventers to come up with new ways
to capture this fleeting moment, we can study the moment ourselves. After all, most studies of déjà vu
are based on first-hand accounts, so why can't one be yours? The next time you get déjà vu,
take a moment to think about it. Have you been distracted? Is there a familiar object somewhere? Is your brain just acting slow? Or is it something else?

**Transcript**:
Using the word Shakespeare within any classroom in the 21st century has become almost as dangerous for teachers as putting balloons in a toaster. After uttering this simple word, the common teacher is met with a mass of groans, moans, devastated looks, and the occasional chair tossed in his or her direction. But Shakespearean works are not boring, confusing, long and painful plays written more than 400 years ago. They're adventures relating to the extremities of human nature: love, hate, jealousy, zealous ambition, fear, mistrust, deception, and murder. We owe much of our own language to his invention. He invented over 2,000 words for use in his plays, which still remain in the Oxford English Dictionary. Words like "countless" and "assassination" as well as phrases like "one fell swoop," "foul play," and even "to be in a pickle" all originated from William's brilliant brain. And there are many echoes of Shakespeare's romantic language too. If you read Romeo and Juliet, you'll come across sentences like, "She doth teach the torches to burn bright," and, "So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows." Both are quite clever metaphors, suggesting that Juliet is both exceptionally beautiful and far moreso than anyone else. "For thou art as glorious to this night, being o'er my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven," is a simile suggesting angelic qualities of the lady in question. This is not too different from today's comments like, "Hey, beautiful!" and, "You're the hottest girl in the room." Shakespeare also uses slightly more complex metaphors to describe the intentions of a mischievous man. For instance, "This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss," essentially means, "I wish to kiss you." Such male intentions were not limited to simple pecks on the cheek either. An intentional ambiguity was often used as a cheeky means to proposition marriage or a more intimate relationship. Therefore, instead of viewing Shakespearean works as out-dated, boring, and unhelpful, start reading today and discover the best ways to get the one you love to love you back.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 4, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As you can see, I was born without fingers on my right hand. And also my right leg was several inches shorter than my left one. They broke the bones in the leg, then they screwed metal spikes into the bone. It has not only spikes, but wires that go all the way through the leg to stabilize it. I have to walk on it. I have to stretch it out so that my muscles don't just get all atrophied. People always ask me, "Does it hurt?" Yes, it does, but I focus on what I can do, not on what I cannot do. I want to talk with you guys about overcoming obstacles. Everybody has obstacles, a disability, a hurdle. We face a choice: Let the obstacle overcome you or overcome the obstacle. Maybe some of you have heard of Jim Abbott. He was a Major League baseball player. He won a gold metal in the Olympics. He played for the Yankees, the Angels. But he threw a no-hitter, and he only had one arm. When he was a kid, he came home mad one time and told his dad, "The kids won't let me play baseball because I only have one hand." His dad replied, "No, the kids won't let you play baseball because you stink at baseball. You can't change the fact that you only have one hand, but you can change the fact that you stink." So, his dad began to practice with him, and he got good. He overcame obstacles. Teams would try to exploit his weak side. They would try to bunt to the side that he had a missing arm. But they never succeeded because he practiced and practiced fielding bunts to that side. There's no dishonor in having a disability, and I won't let anyone diss my ability, but I don't want anyone's pity either. I will not use the obstacles I face as an excuse for having a pity party. I will practice harder, play harder, and push myself harder to keep getting better. Last season I started on my varsity high school basketball team as a freshman, and I won Rookie of the Year. I was one of the top scorers on the team. One of the things that I find funny is that people judge me by appearance. They say, "Oh, look at this one-handed whitey with the limp. I don't want him on my team!" But what they don't know is that I don't just have a disability, I have an ability. One of my favorite moments from this last season was we played a team that we had never played before. And when the game started, you could tell that they were dissing my disability. I mean, they double-teamed our tallest player. They just were playing really soft on me, and they just, you could tell they thought, "What can this guy with one hand do?" So, they left me open for a three. I made that one. They left me open for another one. I made that one. Then, they started to get frustrated, so they actually fouled me. I made both free throws. And they called time out. And as we were in the huddle, I could hear the other coach yelling at his players about me. They went from not covering me at all to double-teaming me. It's all about overcoming obstacles. It's true, I have a disability, but so do you. I also have an ability, so do you. Everyone has obstacles to overcome. Some are visible like mine. Some are less visible. Maybe your obstacle is that you come from a poor neighborhood. Maybe people say you'll never amount to anything. Prove them wrong. Maybe your obstacle is that you have a learning disability, and people think that you're dumb. Prove them wrong. Maybe people judge you because of the color of your skin or your family background. Prove them wrong. I know a lot of people who take one look at me and judge me. They say, "Oh, that kid can't be any good at basketball. One leg, one hand." If someone things you can't overcome the obstacles, prove them wrong.

Wars are a tragic part of our history and will almost certainly be a tragic part of our future. Since the establishment of the United Nations, wars of aggression have been outlawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war. But the wars of the future won't be like the wars of our past. Alongside traditional warfare, our future will include cyberwarfare, remotely fighting our enemies through the use of a new class of weapons, including computer viruses and programs to alter the enemy's ability to operate. And not only is cyberwarfare not covered by existing legal frameworks, but the question of what exactly constitutes cyberwarfare is still highly debated. So, how can we deal with cyberwarfare if we can't even agree on what it means? One way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed. Imagine a new kind of assassin, one that could perpetrate a crime without firing a single shot or even being in the same country. For example, an individual working for the government uses a wireless device to send a signal to another foreign leader's pacemaker. This device directs the pacemaker to malfunction, ultimately resulting in the foreign leader's death. Would this cyber assassination constitute an act of war? As a second example, imagine an allied group of nations cooperatively infiltrating the computer systems of an enemy nation's nuclear warship. This attack results in a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier almost melting down, which was stopped just short of killing thousands of soldiers and civilians. As a defensive measure, the enemy country responds by unleashing a defensive cyberattack that results in the allied nations' power grids going down. Hospitals can no longer treat patients, entire regions without heat or clean water, all ultimately causing tens of thousands civilian deaths. The origin of the power failure was the counterattack, but the fragile infrastructure, feeble cybersecurity, and the antiquated state of the power grid all contributed to the deaths of the civilians. Could the country fight back? Who would they fight? And would their retaliation be considered an act of war? Do they constitute war crimes against humanity? Who is to be held responsible? The computer programmers who wrote the code? The military project manager who oversaw the creation of the code? The commander who hit the button, setting off the event? The hardware engineer who created the computers, knowing that they were intended to enable an attack? Because war has been with us for so long, we have laws to deal with figuring out who should be held accountable for their actions in combat. These legal frameworks aim to contain and prevent atrocities from being more atrocious. Commandeering civilian planes and using them as weapons, dropping atomic bombs, the use of gas chambers or poisonous gas in conflict, all of these actions, if committed, constitute acts of war and war crimes under customary international law and the Hague conventions. Again, the current legal framework stays silent on hypothetical questions and countless others because there are no easy answers, and there are only two ways to make progress on these questions: peace or new laws. So, what hypothetical but plausible scenarios can you imagine falling under the burgeoning definition of cyberwarfare, and how might you design an international legal framework to deter these activities?

**Transcript**:
On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world. On average, it's the coldest, windiest, driest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles, but Antarctica is so dry, it's considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeters along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 degrees Celsius. Because it's so harsh and hard to get to, there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Even the most extreme animals fight for survival, and only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of algae, animals, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protista. But why is Antarctica colder than its northern cousin? Well, first, much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. That's why mountaintops have snow on them. Second, remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean. The water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic, and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack. This prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic. During the aphelion in July, when the Earth is the farthest away from the Sun, it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic, which creates a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole. But despite being inhospitable, the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is. Both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers. They help moderate the temperature in our temperate zones and give us stable weather. As sea ice in the Arctic declines due to climate change and global warming, weather around the globe becomes increasing more unstable.

**Transcript**:
On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice.

**Transcript**:
On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world. On average, it's the coldest, windiest, driest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles, but Antarctica is so dry, it's considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeters along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 degrees Celsius. Because it's so harsh and hard to get to, there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Even the most extreme animals fight for survival, and only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of algae, animals, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protista. But why is Antarctica colder than its northern cousin? Well, first, much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. That's why mountaintops have snow on them. Second, remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean. The water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic, and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack. This prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic. During the aphelion in July, when the Earth is the farthest away from the Sun, it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic, which creates a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole. But despite being inhospitable, the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is. Both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers. They help moderate the temperature in our temperate zones and give us stable weather. As sea ice in the Arctic declines due to climate change and global warming, weather around the globe becomes increasing more unstable.

**Transcript**:
I have been teaching for a long time and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students in 1931 my grandmother bottom left for you guys over here graduated from the eighth grade she went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived it was in the books it was inside the teacher's head and she needed to go there to get the information because that's how you learned fast forwarded generation this is the one-room schoolhouse Oak Grove my father went to a one-room schoolhouse and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored in the only portable memory he has which is inside his own head and take it with him because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world when I was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house it was purchased the year I was born and it was extraordinary because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome this was different than either generation had experienced before and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level but the information was closer to me I could get access to it in the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching we really see the advent of the internet right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas small town Kansas where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely small town rural Kansas School District where I was teaching my favorite subject American government my first year super gung-ho going to teach American government love the political system kids in the 12th grade not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system you're too learned a few things had to change my tactic and I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it I posed a problem in front of them which was to put on an election form for their own community they produced fliers they called offices they check schedules they were meeting with secretaries they produced an election form booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and you know whether or not the streets were done well and really had this robust experiential learning the older teachers more experienced looked at me and went oh there she is that's so cute she's trying to get that done she doesn't know what she's in for but I knew that the kids would show up and I and I believed it and I told them every week um what I expected out of them and that night all 90 kids dressed appropriately doing their job owning it I had to just sit and watch it was theirs it was experiential it was authentic it meant something to them and they will step up from Kansas I moved on to lovely Arizona where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years this time with middle school students luckily I didn't have to teach them American government could teach the more exciting topic of geography and again thrilled to learn but what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities and one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina which is the gentleman that the movie Hotel Rwanda is based after and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us we could walk there we didn't even have to pay for the buses there was no expense cost perfect field trip the problem then becomes how do you take seventh and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life or in their own story or in their own world that they could identify that had done a similar thing I asked them to produce a little movie about it first time we've done this nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer but they were into it and I to put their own voice over it it was the most awesome moment of Revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves what they're willing to share the last question of the assignment is how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary fast-forward to Pennsylvania where I find myself today I teach at the science Leadership Academy which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia we are a nine through twelve public school but we do school quite differently I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learn and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you were willing to kind of let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school into a moment where we have information surplus and so what do you do when the information is all around you why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information in Pennsylvania we have in Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program so the kids are bringing in laptops with them every day taking them home getting access to information and here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process we deal right now in the educational landscape with an it just an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple-choice test and I am here to share with you it is not learning that is the absolute wrong thing to ask to tell kids to never be wrong to ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn so we did this project and this is one of the artifacts of the project I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure my students produce these infographics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the infographics that existed you know in a lot of mass media and take a look at what were the interesting components of it and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history and they had certain criteria to do it they were a little uncomfortable with it because we never done this before and they didn't know exactly how to do it they can talk they are very smooth and they can write very very well but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them but I gave them the room to just do the thing go create go figure it out let's let's see what we can do and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint this was done in like two or three days and this is the work of the student that consistently did it when I sat the students down I said who's got the best one and they immediately went there it is didn't read anything there it is and I said well what makes it great in there like oh the design is good and he's using good color and they're submitting it and they went through all of we processed out loud and I said go read it and they're like Oh Alan that one wasn't so awesome and then we went to another one he didn't have good visuals but had great information and spent an hour talking about the learning process because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect or whether or not it was what I could create it asked them to create for themselves and it allowed them to fail process learn from and when we do another round of this in my class this year they will do better this time because learning has to include amount and amount of failure because failure is instructional in the process there are a million pictures that I could click through here and had to choose carefully this is one of my favourites of students learning of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information but instead ask them what they can do with it ask some really interesting questions they will not disappoint ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire this is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on Tuesday when I asked the students to go to the polls this is Robbie and this was his first day of voting and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that but this is learning too because we asked them to go out into real spaces the main point is that if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning empowering student voice and embracing failure we're missing the mark and everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities because we won't get there with a standardized test and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer we know how to do this better and it's time to do better

I have been teaching for a long time and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students in 1931 my grandmother bottom left for you guys over here graduated from the eighth grade she went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived it was in the books it was inside the teacher's head and she needed to go there to get the information because that's how you learned fast forwarded generation this is the one-room schoolhouse Oak Grove my father went to a one-room schoolhouse and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored in the only portable memory he has which is inside his own head and take it with him because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world when I was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house it was purchased the year I was born and it was extraordinary because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome this was different than either generation had experienced before and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level but the information was closer to me I could get access to it in the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching we really see the advent of the internet right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas small town Kansas where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely small town rural Kansas School District where I was teaching my favorite subject American government my first year super gung-ho going to teach American government love the political system kids in the 12th grade not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system you're too learned a few things had to change my tactic and I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it I posed a problem in front of them which was to put on an election form for their own community they produced fliers they called offices they check schedules they were meeting with secretaries they produced an election form booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and you know whether or not the streets were done well and really had this robust experiential learning the older teachers more experienced looked at me and went oh there she is that's so cute she's trying to get that done she doesn't know what she's in for but I knew that the kids would show up and I and I believed it and I told them every week um what I expected out of them and that night all 90 kids dressed appropriately doing their job owning it I had to just sit and watch it was theirs it was experiential it was authentic it meant something to them and they will step up from Kansas I moved on to lovely Arizona where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years this time with middle school students luckily I didn't have to teach them American government could teach the more exciting topic of geography and again thrilled to learn but what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities and one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina which is the gentleman that the movie Hotel Rwanda is based after and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us we could walk there we didn't even have to pay for the buses there was no expense cost perfect field trip the problem then becomes how do you take seventh and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life or in their own story or in their own world that they could identify that had done a similar thing I asked them to produce a little movie about it first time we've done this nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer but they were into it and I to put their own voice over it it was the most awesome moment of Revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves what they're willing to share the last question of the assignment is how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary fast-forward to Pennsylvania where I find myself today I teach at the science Leadership Academy which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia we are a nine through twelve public school but we do school quite differently I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learn and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you were willing to kind of let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school into a moment where we have information surplus and so what do you do when the information is all around you why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information in Pennsylvania we have in Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program so the kids are bringing in laptops with them every day taking them home getting access to information and here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process we deal right now in the educational landscape with an it just an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple-choice test and I am here to share with you it is not learning that is the absolute wrong thing to ask to tell kids to never be wrong to ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn so we did this project and this is one of the artifacts of the project I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure my students produce these infographics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the infographics that existed you know in a lot of mass media and take a look at what were the interesting components of it and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history and they had certain criteria to do it they were a little uncomfortable with it because we never done this before and they didn't know exactly how to do it they can talk they are very smooth and they can write very very well but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them but I gave them the room to just do the thing go create go figure it out let's let's see what we can do and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint this was done in like two or three days and this is the work of the student that consistently did it when I sat the students down I said who's got the best one and they immediately went there it is didn't read anything there it is and I said well what makes it great in there like oh the design is good and he's using good color and they're submitting it and they went through all of we processed out loud and I said go read it and they're like Oh Alan that one wasn't so awesome and then we went to another one he didn't have good visuals but had great information and spent an hour talking about the learning process because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect or whether or not it was what I could create it asked them to create for themselves and it allowed them to fail process learn from and when we do another round of this in my class this year they will do better this time because learning has to include amount and amount of failure because failure is instructional in the process there are a million pictures that I could click through here and had to choose carefully this is one of my favourites of students learning of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information but instead ask them what they can do with it ask some really interesting questions they will not disappoint ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire this is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on Tuesday when I asked the students to go to the polls this is Robbie and this was his first day of voting and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that but this is learning too because we asked them to go out into real spaces the main point is that if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning empowering student voice and embracing failure we're missing the mark and everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities because we won't get there with a standardized test and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer we know how to do this better and it's time to do better

hello my name is Bert Baer and I'm 11 years old I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system first of all I would like to say that I'm really amazed how easily kids rolla to believe all the marketing advertising on TV at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look it seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids like me to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet little kids especially are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys I must admit I used to be one of them I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows graze on grass all day what I discovered was this is not true I began to look into the stuff on the internet in books and in documentary films in my travels with my family I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system first there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms that is what seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not in tune by nature like taking the DNA of fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato yuck don't get me wrong I like fish and tomatoes but this is just creepy the seeds the seeds our complaintant then grow the food they produce an improvement cost cancer and other problems of lab animals and people have been eat food produced this way since the 1990s most folks don't even know they exist did you know rats fed genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity these include kidney inflammation and lesions in the crease kidney wait yeah almost all the corn wheat has been altered in ethically in some way and let me tell you corn isn't everything and don't even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations called K flows conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels they mix with the dirt to make plants grow they do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again next more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables like pesticides and herbicides to kill weeds and bugs when it rains these chemicals seep into the ground or run up into our waterways poisoning our water too then they are radiates our food trying to make it last longer so it can travel thousands of miles from what's grown to the supermarkets so I ask myself how can I change how can I change these things this is what I found out I discovered that there's a movement for a better way now while back I wanted to be an NFL football player I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead and that way I can have a greater impact on the world this man Joel Salatin they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system since I'm homeschooled I want to go here speak one day this man this lunatic farmer doesn't use any pesticides herbicides or genetically modified seeds and so for that he's called crazy by the system I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices by buying our food directly from local farmers or neighbors we know in real life some people say organic or local food is more expensive but is it really with all these things I've been learning about the food system it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital I know now I know definitely which one I would choose I want you to know that there are farms out there I built here and so qua Chico's farms in Tennessee whose cows do t grass and his pigs do own the mug just like I thought sometimes I got to Bill's farm and volunteer so I can see up close and personal where the meat comes from I want you to know that I believe kids wheat fresh vegetables and good food ethic nor more about it and her really comes from I want you to know that there are farmers markets in every community popping up I want you to know that me my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips I try to share this everywhere I go not too long ago my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal he asked if he wanted organic touch the O's or the sugar-coated flakes you know the one of the big stripe and cartoon character on the front my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic touch with Oh cereal because Burke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal and that my friends is how we can make a difference one K at a time so next time you're at the grocery store think local choose organic know your font and know your food you

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We already know that the world is made of things, things like cats and macaroni salad, and macaroni salad is made of things like mayo and mustard and celery, which are all made of molecules. As we'll see, these molecules are made of the same stuff, just mixed together in different ways. Let's go back to our macaroni salad. We've already unmixed things physically as much as we can. Now, we'll go further and unmix things chemically by breaking some bonds. Many larger, complex molecules are just a bunch of smaller molecules bonded together like building blocks. Here, again, macaroni salad provides a nice example. If you look at the pasta, you'll notice it's made of a lot of this stuff, starch, which is this molecule, otherwise known as amylose. Turns out, if you break some bonds, amylose is made up of smaller molecules of glucose, a simple sugar. If you take a bunch of these same glucose molecules and rearrange them in a different way, you get cellulose, which is what plants are made of. So, while this piece of pasta made of amylose and this wooden spoon made of cellulose look vastly different, they're both essentially made of the same molecules, just stuck together differently. This type of breaking apart and recombining is what goes on when you digest food. The complex proteins found in the foods we eat, like carrots and eggs, can't be used by our bodies because we are not carrots or chickens. What we can use are the smaller molecules that make up these proteins, the amino acids. During digestion, our bodies break these proteins up into their amino acids so they can be rearranged and put back together to make human proteins. But let's keep breaking bonds. All molecules are made up of atoms bonded together. If some molecules are building blocks, atoms are the building blocks of the building blocks. And you'll notice that with the molecules from macaroni salad, the same six types of atoms keep showing up: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, or CHONPS. There's a few others, but the big six is what macaroni salad is made of. If we went a step further, we could use these same atoms, recombine them, and make other stuff like gasoline or sulfuric acid, methane, and nylon. It's all made from the same elements that make up macaroni salad. So, to recap, everything is made of atoms. They are the stuff that things are made of. Atoms are grouped together in different ways to form molecules. These molecules are constantly being combined, broken apart, and recombined. They get thrown into mixtures, separated, remixed over and over and over again. The stuff that things are made of is always in flux; it's always changing. Macaroni salad is only macaroni salad for a short time.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
We already know that the world is made of things, things like cats and macaroni salad, and macaroni salad is made of things like mayo and mustard and celery, which are all made of molecules. As we'll see, these molecules are made of the same stuff, just mixed together in different ways. Let's go back to our macaroni salad. We've already unmixed things physically as much as we can. Now, we'll go further and unmix things chemically by breaking some bonds. Many larger, complex molecules are just a bunch of smaller molecules bonded together like building blocks. Here, again, macaroni salad provides a nice example. If you look at the pasta, you'll notice it's made of a lot of this stuff, starch, which is this molecule, otherwise known as amylose. Turns out, if you break some bonds, amylose is made up of smaller molecules of glucose, a simple sugar. If you take a bunch of these same glucose molecules and rearrange them in a different way, you get cellulose, which is what plants are made of. So, while this piece of pasta made of amylose and this wooden spoon made of cellulose look vastly different, they're both essentially made of the same molecules, just stuck together differently. This type of breaking apart and recombining is what goes on when you digest food. The complex proteins found in the foods we eat, like carrots and eggs, can't be used by our bodies because we are not carrots or chickens. What we can use are the smaller molecules that make up these proteins, the amino acids. During digestion, our bodies break these proteins up into their amino acids so they can be rearranged and put back together to make human proteins. But let's keep breaking bonds. All molecules are made up of atoms bonded together. If some molecules are building blocks, atoms are the building blocks of the building blocks. And you'll notice that with the molecules from macaroni salad, the same six types of atoms keep showing up: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, or CHONPS. There's a few others, but the big six is what macaroni salad is made of. If we went a step further, we could use these same atoms, recombine them, and make other stuff like gasoline or sulfuric acid, methane, and nylon. It's all made from the same elements that make up macaroni salad. So, to recap, everything is made of atoms. They are the stuff that things are made of. Atoms are grouped together in different ways to form molecules. These molecules are constantly being combined, broken apart, and recombined. They get thrown into mixtures, separated, remixed over and over and over again. The stuff that things are made of is always in flux; it's always changing. Macaroni salad is only macaroni salad for a short time. You eat it, some of it becomes part of you, the rest eventually goes into the ocean and gets eaten by other animals that die, and after millions of years, they turn into oil, which is where gasoline comes from. And that's why gasoline and macaroni salad are not that different - they're both made of the same stuff, just one tastes better.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine you're at a football game when this obnoxious guy sits next to you. He's loud, he spills his drink on you, and he makes fun of your team. Days later, you're walking in the park when suddenly it starts to pour rain. Who should show up at your side to offer you an umbrella? The same guy from the football game. Do you change your mind about him based on this second encounter, or do you go with your first impression and write him off? Research in social psychology suggests that we're quick to form lasting impressions of others based on their behaviors. We manage to do this with little effort, inferring stable character traits from a single behavior, like a harsh word or a clumsy step. Using our impressions as guides, we can accurately predict how people are going to behave in the future. Armed with the knowledge the guy from the football game was a jerk the first time you met him, you might expect more of the same down the road. If so, you might choose to avoid him the next time you see him. That said, we can change our impressions in light of new information. Behavioral researchers have identified consistent patterns that seem to guide this process of impression updating. On one hand, learning very negative, highly immoral information about someone typically has a stronger impact than learning very positive, highly moral information. So, unfortunately for our new friend from the football game, his bad behavior at the game might outweigh his good behavior at the park. Research suggests that this bias occurs because immoral behaviors are more diagnostic, or revealing, of a person's true character. Okay, so by this logic, bad is always stronger than good when it comes to updating. Well, not necessarily. Certain types of learning don't seem to lead to this sort of negativity bias. When learning about another person's abilities and competencies, for instance, this bias flips. It's actually the positive information that gets weighted more heavily. Let's go back to that football game. If a player scores a goal, it ultimately has a stronger impact on your impression of their skills than if they miss the net. The two sides of the updating story are ultimately quite consistent. Overall, behaviors that are perceived as being less frequent are also the ones that people tend to weigh more heavily when forming and updating impressions, highly immoral actions and highly competent actions. So, what's happening at the level of the brain when we're updating our impressions? Using fMRI, or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, researchers have identified an extended network of brain regions that respond to new information that's inconsistent with initial impressions. These include areas typically associated with social cognition, attention, and cognitive control. Moreover, when updating impressions based on people's behaviors, activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus correlates with perceptions of how frequently those behaviors occur in daily life. In other words, the brain seems to be tracking low-level, statistical properties of behavior in order to make complex decisions regarding other people's character. It needs to decide is this person's behavior typical or is it out of the ordinary? In the situation with the obnoxious-football-fan-turned-good-samaritan, your brain says, "Well, in my experience, pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella, but the way this guy acted at the football game, that was unusual." And so, you decide to go with your first impression. There's a good moral in this data: your brain, and by extension you, might care more about the very negative, immoral things another person has done compared to the very positive, moral things, but it's a direct result of the comparative rarity of those bad behaviors. We're more used to people being basically good, like taking time to help a stranger in need. In this context, bad might be stronger than good, but only because good is more plentiful. Think about the last time you judged someone based on their behavior, especially a time when you really feel like you changed your mind about someone. Was the behavior that caused you to update your impression something you'd expect anyone to do, or was it something totally out of the ordinary?

**Transcript**:
Hi, I'm Medium Invader from the classic video game Space Invaders, and I want to tell you a little bit about where video games came from. A video game is an electronic game that has an interface designed for human interaction on a video device. Simple. Video games are used by scientists, the military, and people like you, and their evolution has spread across arcades, consoles, computers, smart phones, and all kinds of other electronics. These days video games are everywhere, but they were actually made in science labs. In fact, the earliest U.S. video game patent on record was in 1948, and at the time it was referred to as a cathode-ray tube amusement device. That's a mouthful! Some of the earliest video games include the Nimrod computer, OXO, Tennis for Two, and my personal favorite, Spacewar! But none of these early video games were ever sold to the public because they were either too huge or too expensive to get out of the lab. This all changed when a man named Ralph Baer looked at his television screen and wondered how else it might be used. In 1972, Baer's idea to get video games out of the science lab and into the living room led to the release of a game console called Odyssey. Odyssey allowed you to play a game on your TV. At about the same time, two other people, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, were working on something similar in a little company called Atari. You might have heard of it, and even if you haven't, I'm sure that your Dad has. Atari's first major game release was in 1972, an arcade game called Pong. It was an immediate hit, and it's credited as the first commercially successful video game. Atari then released a home version of Pong in 1974. By 1978, competition between Atari and another game company called Midway was heating up. Midway had licensed an arcade game for the Japanese company, Taito, that put them on the map. The game: Space Invaders. It featured iconic actors, like me, and it went on to become the second highest selling arcade game of all time. Space Invaders also helped kick off what is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games. In response, Atari followed with the release of the arcade game Asteroids, which ranked sixth on the list of highest selling arcade games. It was a good game, but it's no Space Invaders. By 1980, color came to arcade games, and this was also the year that another video gaming milestone was born. Pac-Man, created by the Japanese company Namco, was brought to the U.S. by Midway. Important to the spread of video games into popular culture, Pac-Man was a character that could be licensed. It wasn't long before it had a song on the charts, a Saturday morning television show, and all sorts of other products. In just a year, Pac-Man arcade games made over one billion dollars in quarters. Then, in 1981, a company called Nintendo started making waves in the U.S. video game market with their release of Donkey Kong. It was the earliest video game to have a story line. The story went a bit like this: Donkey Kong is the pet of a carpenter named Jumpman. Jumpman mistreats his pet ape, so the ape steals his girlfriend, leaving the game player to assume the role of Jumpman and rescue the girl. Jumpman was eventually renamed to Mario. Other iconic arcade games from the early 80s include Frogger, Dragon's Lair, and Mario Brothers. Perhaps the last iconic game considered to be part of the Golden Age of Arcade Games is Double Dragon. It was the first really successful example of the beat-them-up genre. It was released in 1987, and, like Donkey Kong, it featured a damsel in distress storyline, a storyline common in many video games. By the mid-90s, the Golden Age of Arcade Games was coming to an end, and the home game console was gaining in popularity. While arcade games continued to decline in sales over the years, the popularity of video games was merely beginning, and we'll talk about that and a lot more in part two of a brief history of video games.

**Transcript**:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician." What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics." But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them
this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up? Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else? I see, I see one way in the back. You sir, that's three. And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle. Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. (Applause) That's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators, I need to make sure
that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Audience: 22. AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47. AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No. AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case? OK, great. What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator. There is something called
the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself. For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25. AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators
that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do
the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do
on their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649. Would you each enter
that on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take
that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random
three-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number. How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way
that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,
any six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator. Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well? OK, what I'm going to try
and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring
a 10-digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting
for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem
thinking out loud. So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size. Now, I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,
starting with you. I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert
numbers into words. I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated; it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man." (Laughter) There's definitely
a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely. Sorry. (Laughter) If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance
that I will make a mistake here. If I do, don't tell me
what the mistake is; just say, "you're close,"
or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty
entertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do,
don't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK. So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician." What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics." But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them
this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up? Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else? I see, I see one way in the back. You sir, that's three. And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle. Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. (Applause) That's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators, I need to make sure
that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Audience: 22. AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47. AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No. AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case? OK, great. What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator. There is something called
the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself. For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25. AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators
that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do
the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do
on their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649. Would you each enter
that on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take
that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random
three-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number. How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way
that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,
any six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something

Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,

finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing
something a little trickier. Let's take the largest number
on the board here, 8649. Would you each enter
that on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take
that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me
what you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random
three-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably
a seven-digit number. How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way
that I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say "No." (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt
the impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you
to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,
any six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine
the digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,
call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know
your birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --
let's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,
because you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --
you were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me
out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater
challenge for me. AB: What year would you like?
CA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?
CA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.
AB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something
from earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here
who had a 10-digit calculator. Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. You have a 10-digit calculator,
sir, as well? OK, what I'm going to try
and do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring
a 10-digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting
for you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem
thinking out loud. So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind
while I do a calculation of this size. Now, I have to apologize
to our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed
to reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start
doing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,
starting with you. I'll get five digits:
one, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:
one, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number
that I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you
how I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem
down into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers,
creep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert
numbers into words. I store them as words, and later on
retrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated; it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing
something out of "Rain Man." (Laughter) There's definitely
a method to my madness -- definitely, definitely. Sorry. (Laughter) If you want to talk to me
about ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance
that I will make a mistake here. If I do, don't tell me
what the mistake is; just say, "you're close,"
or something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty
entertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do,
don't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows
that I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK. So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem
in the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.
Cookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,
which is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,
finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Art Benjamin,
and I am a "mathemagician." What that means is, I combine
my loves of math and magic to do something I call "mathemagics." But before I get started, I have
a quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them
this morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator
with you, raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up? Now bring it out, bring it out.
Anybody else? I see, I see one way in the back. You sir, that's three. And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle. Would the four of you
please bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. (Applause) That's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance
to work with these calculators, I need to make sure
that they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us
a two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Audience: 22. AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47. AB: Multiply 22 times 47,
make sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No. AB: 594. Let's give three of them
a nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more
standard calculator, just in case? OK, great. What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you
a little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying
even faster on the calculator. There is something called
the square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number
and multiplying it by itself. For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25. AB: 25. The way we can
square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting "times" and then "equals," and on most calculators
that will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an "x squared" button on it, will allow you to do
the calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do
now is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do
on their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second,
the third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.
AB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.
AB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.
AB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square
some three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out
as they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out
a three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another
three-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more
three-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square
a four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you
to the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,
let's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out
a single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit
number that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit
of time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square
a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,
most calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --
don't you hate that? So, since we've reached
the limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.
AB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing

call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.
I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting
all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:
10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people
a nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody
here happen to know the day of the week
that they were born on? If you think you know

Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back
right now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?
Audience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.
AB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.
AB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.
AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know
the day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up
an answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,

out here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.
AB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have
that book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year
outside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s
or way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater

finally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!
AB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
You might have seen this symbol before, whether it's as a temporary tattoo or at a Chinese temple. It's called the yin-yang symbol. It comes from Taoism, a religion born in China and it has far more meaning than you probably realize. The yin is the dark swirl, and the yang is the light one, and each side has a dot of the opposite color, which gives a clue to the meaning of yin and yang. Everything contains the seed of its opposite. Darth Vadar has the seed of goodness, and Luke has the potential to follow his father to the dark side. Like Luke and his father, yin and yang are not total opposites, they are relative to each other. Taoists believe that the universe is made up of energies, vibrations, and matter, which behave differently in different contexts. Something can be yin or yang depending on, well, depending on lots of things. So, while wheat that's growing is yang, when it's being reaped, it's yin. A wave's crest is yang, and the trough is yin. Villages on the sunny side of a valley in China have names like Liuyang or Shiyang, but on the shady side, for example, of the Yangtze River Valley, there's Jiangyin. The brake is yin to the gas pedal's yang. An eggshell is yang, the egg inside is yin. You think you're getting it? Yang is harder, stronger, brighter, and faster, but one can turn into the other or are two sides of the same coin. The sunbeams are yang in comparison to the shadows. The pitch is yang, the catch is yin. The yang starts an action, and the yin receives it, completes it. Yin is the inside space of a cup; it wouldn't be a cup without it. Yang is the cup. The coffee's heat, however, is yang, and its blackness is yin. Yang goes berserk sometimes, but there's some very powerful yins, too, if they don't quite go berserk. Yin is the darker swirl, the female, but there is a white dot in it. And yang is the lighter, the male, but it has a black dot. Water flowing calmly in a river is yin, but when it goes over the waterfall, it's very yang. Toothpicks are yin compared with a telephone pole. The back of a person is more yang than the front. The top of a person is the yang end. Taoism teaches that there is a power in the universe. It's higher, deeper, and truer than any other force. They call it the Tao. It means the way. Like the Force in Star Wars, the Tao has two sides. Unlike other religions where the higher power is all good, and perhaps has an all-evil rival, Taoism teaches that we need to learn from both yin and yang. And unlike religions with gods that are personal, the higher power in Taoism is not. Taoists believe that living in harmony with the way, a person will not have to fight against the universe's natural flow. So, for example, listen more, argue less. Be ready to back up or undo something, and you will make even faster progress. Don't worry about being the best, be who you are. Live simply. Complications take you away from the Tao. "The wise person is flexible," Taoists say. Learning to use the Tao is what Taoism is all about, and that's why you should know your yin from your yang.

**Transcript**:
What's the definition of comedy? Thinkers and philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Hobbes, Freud, and beyond, including anyone misguided enough to try to explain a joke, have pondered it, and no one has settled it. You're lucky you found this video to sort it out. To define comedy, you should first ask why it seems comedy defies definition. The answer's simple. Comedy is the defiance of definition because definitions sometimes need defiance. Consider definition itself. When we define, we use language to set borders around a thing that we've perceived in the whirling chaos of existence. We say what the thing means and fit that in a system of meanings. Chaos becomes cosmos. The universe is translated into a cosmological construct of knowledge. And let's be honest, we need some logical cosmic order, otherwise we'd have pure chaos. Chaos can be rough, so we build a thing that we call reality. Now think about logic and logos, that tight knot connecting a word and truth. And let's jump back to thinking about what's funny, because some people say it's real simple: truth is funny. It's funny because it's true. But that's simplistic. Plenty of lies are funny. Comedic fiction can be funny. Made-up nonsense jibberish is frequently hilarious. For instance, florp -- hysterical! And plenty of truths aren't funny. Two plus two truly equals four, but I'm not laughing just because that's the case. You can tell a true anecdote, but your date may not laugh. So, why are some untruths and only some truths funny? How do these laughable truths and untruths relate to that capital-T Truth, the cosmological reality of facts and definitions? And what makes any of them funny? There's a Frenchman who can help, another thinker who didn't define comedy because he expressly didn't want to. Henri Bergson's a French philosopher who prefaced his essay on laughter by saying he wouldn't define "the comic" because it's a living thing. He argued laughter has a social function to destroy mechanical inelasticity in people's attitudes and behavior. Someone doing the same thing over and over, or building up a false image of themself and the world, or not adapting to reality by just noticing the banana peel on the ground -- this is automatism, ignorance of one's own mindless rigidity, and it's dangerous but also laughable and comic ridicule helps correct it. The comic is a kinetic, vital force, or elan vital, that helps us adapt. Bergson elaborates on this idea to study what's funny about all sorts of things. But let's stay on this. At the base of this concept of comedy is contradiction between vital, adaptive humanity and dehumanized automatism. A set system that claims to define reality might be one of those dehumanizing forces that comedy tends to destroy. Now, let's go back to Aristotle. Not Poetics, where he drops a few thoughts on comedy, no, Metaphysics, the fundamental law of non-contradiction, the bedrock of logic. Contradictory statements are not at the same time true. If A is an axiomatic statement, it can't be the case that A and the opposite of A are both true. Comedy seems to live here, to subsist on the illogic of logical contradiction and its derivatives. We laugh when the order we project on the world is disrupted and disproven, like when the way we all act contradicts truths we don't like talking about, or when strange observations we all make in the silent darkness of private thought are dragged into public by a good stand-up, and when cats play piano, because cats that are also somehow humans disrupt our reality. So, we don't just laugh at truth, we laugh at the pleasurable, edifying revelation of flaws, incongruities, overlaps, and outright conflicts in the supposedly ordered system of truths we use to define the world and ourselves. When we think too highly of our thinking, when we think things are true just because we all say they're logos and stop adapting, we become the butt of jokes played on us by that wacky little trickster, chaos. Comedy conveys that destructive, instructive playfulness, but has no logical definition because it acts upon our logic paralogically from outside its finite borders. Far from having a definite definition, it has an infinite infinition. And the infinition of comedy is that anything can be mined for comedy. Thus, all definitions of reality, especially those that claim to be universal, logical, cosmic, capital-T Truth become laughable.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is a definition?

What's the definition of comedy? Thinkers and philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Hobbes, Freud, and beyond, including anyone misguided enough to try to explain a joke, have pondered it, and no one has settled it. You're lucky you found this video to sort it out. To define comedy, you should first ask why it seems comedy defies definition. The answer's simple. Comedy is the defiance of definition because definitions sometimes need defiance. Consider definition itself. When we define, we use language to set borders around a thing that we've perceived in the whirling chaos of existence. We say what the thing means and fit that in a system of meanings. Chaos becomes cosmos. The universe is translated into a cosmological construct of knowledge. And let's be honest, we need some logical cosmic order, otherwise we'd have pure chaos. Chaos can be rough, so we build a thing that we call reality. Now think about logic and logos, that tight knot connecting a word and truth. And let's jump back to thinking about what's funny, because some people say it's real simple: truth is funny. It's funny because it's true. But that's simplistic. Plenty of lies are funny. Comedic fiction can be funny. Made-up nonsense jibberish is frequently hilarious. For instance, florp -- hysterical! And plenty of truths aren't funny. Two plus two truly equals four, but I'm not laughing just because that's the case. You can tell a true anecdote, but your date may not laugh. So, why are some untruths and only some truths funny? How do these laughable truths and untruths relate to that capital-T Truth, the cosmological reality of facts and definitions? And what makes any of them funny? There's a Frenchman who can help, another thinker who didn't define comedy because he expressly didn't want to. Henri Bergson's a French philosopher who prefaced his essay on laughter by saying he wouldn't define "the comic" because it's a living thing.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Say two people are walking down the street, and they bump into each other. They'll just shake it off and walk on. Sometimes that happens with molecules too. They just bounce off each other, and that's that. But what if two people were to bump into each other, and during that collision, one person's arm got severed and reattached to the other person's face? Now that sounds really weird, but it's similar to one of the many ways that molecules can react with each other. Two molecules can join and become one. One can split apart and become two. Molecules can switch parts. All these changes are chemical reactions, and we can see them happening around us. For example, when fireworks explode, or iron rusts, or milk goes bad, or people are born, grow old, die, and then decompose. But chemical reactions don't just happen willy nilly! Everything has to be right. First, the molecules have to hit each other in the right orientation. And second, they have to hit each other hard enough, in other words, with enough energy. Now you're probably thinking that a reaction just happens in one direction and that's it. Sometimes that's true. For example, things can't unburn or unexplode. But most reactions can happen in both directions, forward and reverse. There's no reason that our face-arm guy can't bump into armless girl, reattaching that arm back to its original socket. Now let's zoom out a bit. Now let's say that you've got a thousand people on the street, and all of them start with their limbs normally attached. At the beginning, every collision is a chance for Person A to transfer an arm to Person B's face. And so at the beginning, more and more people end up with arms attached to their faces or arms missing. But as the number of people with arm-faces and missing arms grows, collisions between those people become more likely. And when they bump into each other, guess what? Normal-appendage people are reproduced. Now the number of limb transfers per second forward will start high and then fall, and the number of limb transfers per second backward will start at zero and then rise. Eventually they'll meet, they'll be the same. And when that happens, the number of people in each state stops changing, even though people are still bumping into each other and exchanging limbs. Now how many people do you think there are in each state? Half and half, right? No, well, maybe. It depends. It could be 50/50, but it could be 60/40 or 15/85, or anything. We chemists have to get our little, gloved hands dirty - ah, well, we're in a lab so not really dirty - to figure out what the actual distribution of molecules is. Even though each of limb transfers is a pretty dramatic event for the people involved, if we zoom out, we see population numbers that don't change. We call this nirvana equilibrium, and it doesn't just happen with chemical reactions. Things like gene pools and highway traffic show the same pattern. It looks pretty still from 30,000 feet, but there is lots of crazy stuff happening on the ground, you just need to zoom in to see it.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 15, Ground Truth Question 3, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Say two people are walking down the street, and they bump into each other. They'll just shake it off and walk on. Sometimes that happens with molecules too. They just bounce off each other, and that's that. But what if two people were to bump into each other, and during that collision, one person's arm got severed and reattached to the other person's face? Now that sounds really weird, but it's similar to one of the many ways that molecules can react with each other. Two molecules can join and become one. One can split apart and become two. Molecules can switch parts. All these changes are chemical reactions, and we can see them happening around us. For example, when fireworks explode, or iron rusts, or milk goes bad, or people are born, grow old, die, and then decompose. But chemical reactions don't just happen willy nilly! Everything has to be right. First, the molecules have to hit each other in the right orientation. And second, they have to hit each other hard enough, in other words, with enough energy. Now you're probably thinking that a reaction just happens in one direction and that's it. Sometimes that's true. For example, things can't unburn or unexplode. But most reactions can happen in both directions, forward and reverse. There's no reason that our face-arm guy can't bump into armless girl, reattaching that arm back to its original socket. Now let's zoom out a bit. Now let's say that you've got a thousand people on the street, and all of them start with their limbs normally attached. At the beginning, every collision is a chance for Person A to transfer an arm to Person B's face. And so at the beginning, more and more people end up with arms attached to their faces or arms missing. But as the number of people with arm-faces and missing arms grows, collisions between those people become more likely. And when they bump into each other, guess what? Normal-appendage people are reproduced. Now the number of limb transfers per second forward will start high and then fall, and the number of limb transfers per second backward will start at zero and then rise. Eventually they'll meet, they'll be the same. And when that happens, the number of people in each state stops changing, even though people are still bumping into each other and exchanging limbs. Now how many people do you think there are in each state? Half and half, right? No, well, maybe. It depends. It could be 50/50, but it could be 60/40 or 15/85, or anything.

**Transcript**:
There are a lot of ways this marvelous language of ours, English, doesn't make sense. For example, most of the time when we talk about more
than one of something, we put an S on the end. One cat, two cats. But then, there's that handful of words where things work differently. Alone you have a man; if he has company, then you've got men, or probably better for him, women too. Although if there were only one of them, it would be a woman. Or if there's more than one goose, they're geese, but why not lots of mooses, meese? Or if you have two feet, then why don't you read two beek instead of books. The fact is that if you
were speaking English before about a thousand years ago, beek is exactly what you would have said for more than one book. If Modern English is strange, Old English needed therapy. Believe it or not, English used to be an even harder language to learn than it is today. Twenty-five hundred years ago, English and German were the same language. They drifted apart slowly, little by little becoming
more and more different. That meant that in early English, just like in German, inanimate objects had gender. A fork, gafol, was a woman; a spoon, laefel, was a man; and the table they were on, bord, was neither, also called neuter. Go figure! Being able to use words meant not just knowing their meaning but what gender they were, too. And while today there
are only about a dozen plurals that don't make sense, like men and geese, in Old English, it was perfectly normal for countless plurals to be like that. You think it's odd that more
than one goose is geese? Well, imagine if more than one goat was a bunch of gat, or if more than one oak tree was a field of ack. To be able to talk about any of these, you just had to know the exact
word for their plural rather than just adding
the handy S on the end. And it wasn't always
an S at the end either. In merry Old English, they could add other sounds to the end. Just like more than one child is children, more than one lamb was lambru, you fried up your eggru, and people talked not about breads, but breadru. Sometimes it was like sheep is today - where, to make a plural,
you don't do anything. One sheep, two sheep. In Old English, one house, two house. And just like today, we have
oxen instead of oxes. Old English people had
toungen instead of tongues, namen instead of names, and if things stayed the way they were, today we would have eyen instead of eyes. So, why didn't things
stay the way they were? In a word, Vikings. In the 8th century, Scandinavian marauders started taking over much of England. They didn't speak English, they spoke Norse. Plus, they were grown-ups, and grown-ups aren't as good at learning languages as children. After the age of roughly 15, it's almost impossible
to learn a new language without an accent and without slipping up here and there as we all know from what language
classes are like. The Vikings were no different, so they had a way of smoothing away the harder parts of how English worked. Part of that was those crazy plurals. Imagine running up against a language with eggru and gat on the one hand, and then with other words, all you have to do is add 's' and get days and stones. Wouldn't it make things easier to just use the 's' for everything? That's how the Vikings felt too. And there were so many of them, and they married so
many of the English women, that pretty soon, if you
grew up in England, you heard streamlined English
as much as the real kind. After a while nobody remembered
the real kind any more. Nobody remembered that once you said doora instead of doors and handa instead of hands. Plurals made a lot more sense now, except for a few hold-outs like children and teeth that get used so much that it was hard to break the habit. The lesson is that English makes a lot
more sense than you think. Thank the ancestors of people in Copenhagen and Oslo for the fact that today we don't ask
for a handful of pea-night instead of peanuts. Although, wouldn't it be fun, if for just a week or two, we could?

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 17, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Take a moment to read the following. How was that? Frustrating? Slow? What were those sentences about? They're actually a simulation of the experience of dyslexia, designed to make you decode each word. Those with dyslexia experience
that laborious pace every time they read. When most people think of dyslexia, they think of seeing letters
and words backwards, like seeing "b" as "d" and vice versa, or they might think people with dyslexia see "saw" as "was". The truth is people with dyslexia see things the same way as everyone else. Dyslexia is caused by a phonological
processing problem, meaning people affected by it have trouble not with seeing language but with manipulating it. For example, if you heard the word cat and then someone asked
you, "Remove the 'c'," what word would you have left? At. This can be difficult
for those with dyslexia. Given a word in isolation, like fantastic, students with dyslexia
need to break the word into parts to read it: fan, tas, tic. Time spent decoding makes it hard to keep up with peers and gain sufficient comprehension. Spelling words phonetically, like s-t-i-k for stick and f-r-e-n-s for friends is also common. These difficulties are more
widespread and varied than commonly imagined. Dyslexia affects up to one in five people. It occurs on a continuum. One person might have mild dyslexia while the next person has
a profound case of it. Dyslexia also runs in families. It's common to see one family member who has trouble spelling while another family member has severe difficulty decoding
even one syllable words, like catch. The continuum and distribution of dyslexia suggests a broader
principle to bear in mind as we look at how the brains
of those with dyslexia process language. Neurodiversity is the idea that because all our brains
show differences in structure and function, we shouldn't be so quick to label every deviation from "the norm" as a pathological disorder or dismiss people living
with these variations as "defective." People with neurobiological
variations like dyslexia, including such creative
and inventive individuals as Picasso, Muhammad Ali, Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, and Cher, clearly have every capacity to be brilliant and successful in life. So, here's the special way the brains of those with dyslexia work. The brain is divided into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is generally
in charge of language and, ultimately, reading, while the right typically
handles spatial activities. fMRI studies have found that the brains of those with dyslexia rely more on the right
hemisphere and frontal lobe than the brains of those without it. This means, when they read a word, it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe. Because of this neurobiological glitch, they read with more difficulty. But those with dyslexia can physically change their brain and improve their reading with an intensive,
multi-sensory intervention that breaks the language down and teaches the reader to decode based on syllable types
and spelling rules. The brains of those with dyslexia begin using the left hemisphere more efficiently while reading, and their reading improves. The intervention works because it locates dyslexia appropriately as a functional variation in the brain, which, naturally, shows
all sorts of variations from one person to another. Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum of brain function in all humans and suggests that to better
understand the perspectives of those around us, we should try not only to see
the world through their eyes but understand it through their brains.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 18, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Try to measure a circle. The diameter and radius are easy, they're just straight lines you can measure with a ruler. But to get the circumference, you'd need measuring tape
or a piece of string, unless there was a better way. Now, it's obvious that a circle's circumference
would get smaller or larger along with its diameter, but the relationship
goes further than that. In fact, the ratio between the two, the circumference divided by the diameter, will always be the same number, no matter how big
or small the circle gets. Historians aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered, but it's been known in some form for almost 4,000 years. Estimates of it appear
in the works of ancient Greek, Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian mathematicians. And it's even believed to have been used in building the Egyptian pyramids. Mathematicians estimated it by inscribing polygons in circles. And by the year 1400, it had been calculated to as far
as ten decimal places. So, when did they finally
figure out the exact value instead of just estimating? Actually, never! You see, the ratio of a circle's circumference
to its diameter is what's known as an irrational number, one that can never be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers. You can come close, but no matter how precise the fraction is, it will always be just a tiny bit off. So, to write it out in its decimal form, you'd have an on-going series of digits starting with 3.14159 and continuing forever! That's why, instead of trying to write out an infinite number of digits every time, we just refer to it using
the Greek letter pi. Nowadays, we test the speed of computers by having them calculate pi, and quantum computers have been able to calculate it
up to two quadrillion digits. People even compete to see how many digits they can memorize and have set records for remembering over 67,000 of them. But for most scientific uses, you only need the first forty or so. And what are these scientific uses? Well, just about any calculations
involving circles, from the volume of a can of soda to the orbits of satellites. And it's not just circles, either. Because it's also useful
in studying curves, pi helps us understand periodic
or oscillating systems like clocks, electromagnetic waves, and even music. In statistics, pi is used in the equation to calculate the area
under a normal distribution curve, which comes in handy
for figuring out distributions of standardized test scores, financial models, or margins of error in scientific results. As if that weren't enough, pi is used in particle
physics experiments, such as those using
the Large Hadron Collider, not only due to its round shape, but more subtly, because of the orbits
in which tiny particles move. Scientists have even used pi to prove the illusive notion that light functions as both a particle and an electromagnetic wave, and, perhaps most impressively, to calculate the density
of our entire universe, which, by the way, still has infinitely less stuff in it than the total number of digits in pi.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 18, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Try to measure a circle. The diameter and radius are easy, they're just straight lines you can measure with a ruler. But to get the circumference, you'd need measuring tape
or a piece of string, unless there was a better way. Now, it's obvious that a circle's circumference
would get smaller or larger along with its diameter, but the relationship
goes further than that. In fact, the ratio between the two, the circumference divided by the diameter, will always be the same number, no matter how big
or small the circle gets. Historians aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered, but it's been known in some form for almost 4,000 years. Estimates of it appear
in the works of ancient Greek, Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian mathematicians. And it's even believed to have been used in building the Egyptian pyramids. Mathematicians estimated it by inscribing polygons in circles. And by the year 1400, it had been calculated to as far
as ten decimal places. So, when did they finally
figure out the exact value instead of just estimating? Actually, never! You see, the ratio of a circle's circumference
to its diameter is what's known as an irrational number, one that can never be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers. You can come close, but no matter how precise the fraction is, it will always be just a tiny bit off. So, to write it out in its decimal form, you'd have an on-going series of digits starting with 3.14159 and continuing forever! That's why, instead of trying to write out an infinite number of digits every time, we just refer to it using
the Greek letter pi. Nowadays, we test the speed of computers by having them calculate pi, and quantum computers have been able to calculate it
up to two quadrillion digits. People even compete to see how many digits they can memorize and have set records for remembering over 67,000 of them. But for most scientific uses, you only need the first forty or so. And what are these scientific uses? Well, just about any calculations
involving circles, from the volume of a can of soda to the orbits of satellites. And it's not just circles, either. Because it's also useful
in studying curves, pi helps us understand periodic
or oscillating systems like clocks, electromagnetic waves, and even music. In statistics, pi is used in the equation to calculate the area
under a normal distribution curve, which comes in handy
for figuring out distributions of standardized test scores, financial models, or margins of error in scientific results. As if that weren't enough, pi is used in particle
physics experiments, such as those using
the Large Hadron Collider, not only due to its round shape, but more subtly, because of the orbits
in which tiny particles move. Scientists have even used pi to prove the illusive notion that light functions as both a particle and an electromagnetic wave, and, perhaps most impressively, to calculate the density
of our entire universe, which, by the way, still has infinitely less stuff in it than the total number of digits in pi.

**Transcript**:
Commas are tricky things, especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved. If you can remember a few basic rules, a simple law of physics, and some common scenarios, you will be able to use commas correctly. I like to think of the different parts of our sentence as characters. Let's meet a few of them: the tiny conjunctions, the mighty subordinates, and the clever comma. Conjunctions are small and nimble. They are words that connect clauses, words, and phrases. You can easily remember the conjunctions by remembering the acronym FANBOYS. The conjunctions are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. Because they're so small, more often than not, they require the help of a comma but not always. Subordinates, on the other hand, are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They are words that connect
two unequal things, dependent and independent clauses. Subordinates make it very clear what is being prioritized in a sentence. Commonly used subordinates are although, because, before, however, unless, and even though. Because subordinates are all about power, they can do a lot of heavy
lifting by themselves. But, of course, sometimes
even the strongest among us needs some help from our clever friends. Because our clever comma is so nice, she often roams her neighborhood looking for some community service to do. Today, as soon as she leaves her house, she sees a subordinate lifting the weight of two complete sentences, one on each arm. Bartheleme loves engaging
in political debate even though he usually loses. The comma asks the subordinate
if he needs help. Well, we know that subordinates are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They can easily hold the weight of these two complete sentences because they are distributed
evenly on both arms. So, when the comma asks if it can help, the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance. No thanks, maybe next time! So, the comma continues on. Soon, she seems a couple of subordinates attempting to lift the weight of sentences directly
in front of themselves. Even though Bartheleme loves to sing, he never sings in front of others. The comma asks the subordinates
if they need help. They might not want to admit it, but this time the subordinates
do need help. Complete sentences weigh quite a bit. Simple physics tells us that it's easier to balance heavy objects if the weight is evenly distributed. So, while the subordinates
are quite capable of balancing two complete sentences when carrying the weight on both sides, they're having trouble
picking just one up. The comma rushes over to help the struggling subordinates, but how will she help? When subordinates begin sentences, the comma will place herself directly after the first
thought or complete sentence. After helping the subordinates, our comma heroine continues on and spots a conjunction holding the weight
of two complete sentences. Bartheleme was accepted
into the University of Chicago, and he is on the waitlist
for Stanford University. The comma asks the conjunction
if he needs help. Of course he does! Hurry! The comma rushes and places
itself before the conjunction. Fanboys aren't as militant
as subordinates. For this reason, the commas don't have to fall
in line behind the fanboys. Fanboys are courteous creatures. They allow the comma to go ahead of them. Helping others is hard work! On her way home, our comma sees a conjunction
holding up the weight of a complete sentence and a fragment sentence. Bartheleme is going to major
in molecular biology or interpretive dance. The now-exhausted comma
asks the conjunction if he needs help lifting the items. This is one of the rare occassions where a conjunction doesn't
need the help of a comma. The conjunction assures the comma that help isn't needed, which is good for the comma because by now, all it wants to do is go home and rest up for another day of vigilant
sentence constructing.

in political debate even though he usually loses. The comma asks the subordinate
if he needs help. Well, we know that subordinates are the WWE heavyweight
champions of sentences. They can easily hold the weight of these two complete sentences because they are distributed
evenly on both arms. So, when the comma asks if it can help, the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance. No thanks, maybe next time! So, the comma continues on. Soon, she seems a couple of subordinates attempting to lift the weight of sentences directly
in front of themselves. Even though Bartheleme loves to sing, he never sings in front of others. The comma asks the subordinates
if they need help. They might not want to admit it, but this time the subordinates
do need help. Complete sentences weigh quite a bit. Simple physics tells us that it's easier to balance heavy objects if the weight is evenly distributed. So, while the subordinates
are quite capable of balancing two complete sentences when carrying the weight on both sides, they're having trouble
picking just one up. The comma rushes over to help the struggling subordinates, but how will she help? When subordinates begin sentences, the comma will place herself directly after the first
thought or complete sentence. After helping the subordinates, our comma heroine continues on and spots a conjunction holding the weight
of two complete sentences. Bartheleme was accepted
into the University of Chicago, and he is on the waitlist
for Stanford University. The comma asks the conjunction
if he needs help. Of course he does! Hurry! The comma rushes and places
itself before the conjunction. Fanboys aren't as militant
as subordinates. For this reason, the commas don't have to fall
in line behind the fanboys. Fanboys are courteous creatures. They allow the comma to go ahead of them. Helping others is hard work! On her way home, our comma sees a conjunction
holding up the weight of a complete sentence and a fragment sentence. Bartheleme is going to major
in molecular biology or interpretive dance. The now-exhausted comma
asks the conjunction if he needs help lifting the items. This is one of the rare occassions where a conjunction doesn't
need the help of a comma. The conjunction assures the comma that help isn't needed, which is good for the comma because by now, all it wants to do is go home and rest up for another day of vigilant
sentence constructing.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 20, Ground Truth Question 3, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every second, one million tons of matter
is blasted from the Sun at the velocity
of one million miles per hour, and it's on a collision course with Earth! But don't worry, this isn't the opening
of a new Michael Bay movie. This is The Journey of the Polar Lights. The northern and southern lights,
also known as the aurora Borealis and aurora Australis, respectively, occur when high energy
particles from the Sun collide with neutral atoms
in our atmosphere. The energy emitted from this crash
produces a spectacle of light that mankind has marveled at
for centuries. But the particles' journey
isn't just as simple as leaving the Sun and arriving at Earth. Like any cross-country road trip,
there's a big detour and nobody asks for directions. Let's track this intergalactic voyage by focusing on three
main points of their journey: leaving the Sun, making a pit stop
in the Earth's magnetic fields, and arriving at the atmosphere
above our heads. The protons and electrons
creating the northern lights depart from the Sun's corona. The corona is the outermost layer
of the Sun's atmosphere and is one of the hottest regions. Its intense heat causes the Sun's hydrogen
and helium atoms to vibrate and shake off protons and electrons as if they were stripping off
layers on a hot, sunny day. Impatient and finally behind the wheel, these free protons
and electrons move too fast to be contained by the Sun's gravity and group together as plasma,
an electrically charged gas. They travel away from the Sun
as a constant gale of plasma, known as the solar wind. However, the Earth prevents the solar wind
from traveling straight into the planet by setting up a detour, the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is formed
by the Earth's magnetic currents and shields our planet
from the solar winds by sending out the particles
around the Earth. Their opportunity to continue the journey
down to the atmosphere comes when the magnetosphere is
overwhelmed by a new wave of travelers. This event is coronal mass ejection, and it occurs when the Sun shoots out a massive ball of plasma
into the solar wind. When one of these coronal mass ejections
collides with Earth, it overpowers the magnetosphere
and creates a magnetic storm. The heavy storm stresses the magnetosphere
until it suddenly snaps back, like and overstretched elastic band, flinging some of the detoured
particles towards Earth. The retracting band of the magnetic field
drags them down to the aurora ovals, which are the locations
of the northern and southern lights. After traveling 93 million miles
across the galaxy, the Sun's particles finally produce
their dazzling light show with the help of some friends. 20 to 200 miles above the surface, the electrons and protons meet up
with oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and they sure are happy to see each other. The Sun's particles high five the atoms,
giving their energy to the Earth's neutral
oxygen and nitrogen atoms. When the atoms in the atmosphere
are contacted by the particles, they get excited and emit photons. Photons are small bursts of energy
in the form of light. The colors that appear in the sky depend on the wavelength
of the atom's photon. Excited oxygen atoms are responsible
for the green and red colors, whereas excited nitrogen atoms
produce blue and deep red hues. The collection of these interactions is what creates the northern
and southern lights. The polar lights
are best seen on clear nights in regions close to magnetic
north and south poles. Nighttime is ideal because the Aurora
is much dimmer than sunlight and cannot be seen in daytime. Remember to look up at the sky
and read up on the Sun's energy patterns, specifically sunspots and solar flares, as these will be good guides
for predicting the auroras.
