**Transcript**:
Despite advances in medicine, cancer remains one of the most frightening
diagnoses patients can receive. What makes it so difficult to cure
is that it's not one illness, but a family of over 100 diseases
occurring in different types of cells. And one type of cancer 
has the unfortunate distinction of afflicting children 
more than any other type. This is leukemia, a cancer that begins in stem cells
found in the bone marrow. A stem cell is a bit like an infant, undeveloped but possessing 
great potential. Many stem cells specialize
and become cells of organs, like the liver, brain and heart. But in some tissues, they can continue to divide into new 
stem cells throughout development, and into adulthood in order to frequently
generate new cells and keep up with the body's needs. One example is the bone marrow, where stem cells differentiate
into many types of blood cells. That includes red blood cells, which carry oxygen 
from the lungs to all tissues, platelets, which help stop bleeding
by sticking to damaged blood vessels, and white blood cells, which patrol the body,
destroying potentially harmful invaders. Every once in a while, something goes wrong during 
a stem cell's specialization process and harmful mutations 
occur in the cell's DNA. Cells with compromised DNA
are supposed to self-destruct, but some damaged cells ignore this order, replicating uncontrollably,
even as they lose their original function. These are what we know as cancer cells. It is not yet clear why leukemia
is the most common childhood cancer, but one contributing factor may be that leukemias are often caused
by just one or two DNA modifications, while most cancers require many of them, allowing leukemias to arise faster
than other types of cancer. Moreover, some DNA alterations
can occur in white blood cells during fetal development, further increasing the risk 
of early leukemia. But though it affects more children
than any other cancer, adults constitute the majority
of leukemia patients overall. Once leukemia strikes, the damaged cells
reproduce in the blood and the bone marrow until they take up 
all available space and resources. When the bone marrow 
can no longer produce the required amount of functional cells, the blood becomes depleted. The lack of red blood cells means that muscles 
don't get enough oxygen, the reduced number of platelets
is not sufficient to repair wounds, and the dearth of functional white
blood cells impairs the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. To restore the normal 
function of the blood, leukemic cells have to be eliminated. But because leukemias 
are not solid tumors, they can't be removed surgically. Instead, the cells are killed
inside the body using various treatments that include chemotherapy, a combination of drugs that destroys
quickly multiplying cells. Unfortunately, this has the side effect
of killing healthy cells, such as those found in hair follicles
or intestines. And in some cases, the dosage 
required is so high that it kills all cells 
in the bone marrow, including stem cells. When this happens, the body is no longer
able to create new blood cells on its own. Fortunately, outside help can come
in the form of stem cells from the bone marrow of a donor. Once transplanted into the patient, they rapidly repopulate 
the bone marrow and the blood. However, bone marrow transplants
are a complicated process requiring antigen compatibility
between the donor and recipient to keep the transplanted cells from
from attacking the patient's own cells as foreign bodies. Unlike with blood transplants, there are thousands of HLA types, and even siblings and close relatives
may not have compatible bone marrow. If this is the case, the search 
is expanded to a database containing the genetic makeup of millions
of voluntary bone marrow donors. The more potential donors there are, the more patients lives can be saved
through successful transplants. Leukemia may be a frightening disease,
but there is strength and hope in numbers.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the content and options, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the function of platelets. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the most relevant, as it asks about the definition of a stem cell, which is related to the context where platelets are mentioned in the transcript. However, it does not directly ask about the function of platelets.

A more relevant question would be one that asks about the functions of different types of blood cells, including platelets. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to pick one, I would say Question 2 is the most relevant, but it's still not a good match.

Index: None (or 2, if you want to consider a somewhat related question)

generate new cells and keep up with the body's needs. One example is the bone marrow, where stem cells differentiate
into many types of blood cells. That includes red blood cells, which carry oxygen 
from the lungs to all tissues, platelets, which help stop bleeding
by sticking to damaged blood vessels, and white blood cells, which patrol the body,
destroying potentially harmful invaders. Every once in a while, something goes wrong during 
a stem cell's specialization process and harmful mutations 
occur in the cell's DNA. Cells with compromised DNA
are supposed to self-destruct, but some damaged cells ignore this order, replicating uncontrollably,
even as they lose their original function. These are what we know as cancer cells. It is not yet clear why leukemia
is the most common childhood cancer, but one contributing factor may be that leukemias are often caused
by just one or two DNA modifications, while most cancers require many of them, allowing leukemias to arise faster
than other types of cancer. Moreover, some DNA alterations
can occur in white blood cells during fetal development, further increasing the risk 
of early leukemia. But though it affects more children
than any other cancer, adults constitute the majority
of leukemia patients overall. Once leukemia strikes, the damaged cells
reproduce in the blood and the bone marrow until they take up 
all available space and resources. When the bone marrow 
can no longer produce the required amount of functional cells, the blood becomes depleted. The lack of red blood cells means that muscles 
don't get enough oxygen, the reduced number of platelets
is not sufficient to repair wounds, and the dearth of functional white
blood cells impairs the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. To restore the normal 
function of the blood, leukemic cells have to be eliminated. But because leukemias 
are not solid tumors, they can't be removed surgically. Instead, the cells are killed
inside the body using various treatments that include chemotherapy, a combination of drugs that destroys
quickly multiplying cells. Unfortunately, this has the side effect
of killing healthy cells, such as those found in hair follicles
or intestines. And in some cases, the dosage 
required is so high that it kills all cells 
in the bone marrow, including stem cells. When this happens, the body is no longer
able to create new blood cells on its own. Fortunately, outside help can come
in the form of stem cells from the bone marrow of a donor. Once transplanted into the patient, they rapidly repopulate 
the bone marrow and the blood. However, bone marrow transplants
are a complicated process requiring antigen compatibility
between the donor and recipient to keep the transplanted cells from
from attacking the patient's own cells as foreign bodies. Unlike with blood transplants, there are thousands of HLA types, and even siblings and close relatives
may not have compatible bone marrow. If this is the case, the search 
is expanded to a database containing the genetic makeup of millions
of voluntary bone marrow donors. The more potential donors there are, the more patients lives can be saved
through successful transplants. Leukemia may be a frightening disease,
but there is strength and hope in numbers.

**Transcript**:
Despite advances in medicine, cancer remains one of the most frightening
diagnoses patients can receive. What makes it so difficult to cure
is that it's not one illness, but a family of over 100 diseases
occurring in different types of cells. And one type of cancer 
has the unfortunate distinction of afflicting children 
more than any other type. This is leukemia, a cancer that begins in stem cells
found in the bone marrow. A stem cell is a bit like an infant, undeveloped but possessing 
great potential. Many stem cells specialize
and become cells of organs, like the liver, brain and heart. But in some tissues, they can continue to divide into new 
stem cells throughout development, and into adulthood in order to frequently

**Transcript**:
They're everywhere, 
but you will never see one. Trillions of them are flying 
through you right this second, but you can't feel them. These ghost particles are called neutrinos
and if we can catch them, they can tell us about 
the furthest reaches and most extreme environments 
of the universe. Neutrinos are elementary particles, meaning that they can't be subdivided
into other particles the way atoms can. Elementary particles are the smallest
known building blocks of everything in the universe, and the neutrino is one 
of the smallest of the small. A million times less massive 
than an electron, neutrinos fly easily through matter,
unaffected by magnetic fields. In fact, they hardly ever 
interact with anything. That means that they can travel
through the universe in a straight line for millions, or even billions, of years, safely carrying information 
about where they came from. So where do they come from? Pretty much everywhere. They're produced in your body
from the radioactive decay of potassium. Cosmic rays hitting atoms 
in the Earth's atmosphere create showers of them. They're produced by nuclear 
reactions inside the sun and by radioactive 
decay inside the Earth. And we can generate them 
in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. But the highest energy neutrinos
are born far out in space in environments that 
we know very little about. Something out there,
maybe supermassive black holes, or maybe some cosmic dynamo
we've yet to discover, accelerates cosmic rays to energies
over a million times greater than anything human-built
accelerators have achieved. These cosmic rays, 
most of which are protons, interact violently with the matter
and radiation around them, producing high-energy neutrinos, which propagate out 
like cosmic breadcrumbs that can tell us about the locations and interiors of the universe's most
powerful cosmic engines. That is, if we can catch them. Neutrinos' limited interactions
with other matter might make them great messengers, but it also makes them 
extremely hard to detect. One way to do so is to put a huge volume
of pure transparent material in their path and wait for a neutrino to reveal itself by colliding with the nucleus of an atom. That's what's happening 
in Antarctica at IceCube, the world's largest neutrino telescope. It's set up within 
a cubic kilometer of ice that has been purified by the pressure of thousands of years 
of accumulated ice and snow, to the point where it's one 
of the clearest solids on Earth. And even though it's shot through with
boreholes holding over 5,000 detectors, most of the cosmic neutrinos racing
through IceCube will never leave a trace. But about ten times a year, a single high-energy neutrino
collides with a molecule of ice, shooting off sparks of charged
subatomic particles that travel faster through the ice
than light does. In a similar way to how a jet
that exceeds the speed of sound produces a sonic boom, these superluminal charged particles
leave behind a cone of blue light, kind of a photonic boom. This light spreads through IceCube, hitting some of its detectors
located over a mile beneath the surface. Photomultiplier tubes amplify the signal, which contains information about 
the charged particles' paths and energies. The data are beamed 
to astrophysicists around the world who look at the patterns of light for clues about the neutrinos 
that produced them. These super energetic collisions
are so rare that IceCube's scientists give each
neutrino nicknames, like Big Bird and Dr. Strangepork. IceCube has already observed the highest energy 
cosmic neutrinos ever seen. The neutrinos it detects should finally
tell us where cosmic rays come from and how they reached 
such extreme energies. Light, from infrared,
to x-rays, to gamma rays, has given us increasingly energetic and continuously surprising 
views of the universe. We are now at the dawn
of the age of neutrino astronomy, and we have no idea 
what revelations IceCube and other neutrino telescopes may bring us about the universe's most violent,
most energetic phenomena.

**Transcript**:
They're everywhere, 
but you will never see one. Trillions of them are flying 
through you right this second, but you can't feel them. These ghost particles are called neutrinos
and if we can catch them, they can tell us about 
the furthest reaches and most extreme environments 
of the universe. Neutrinos are elementary particles, meaning that they can't be subdivided
into other particles the way atoms can. Elementary particles are the smallest
known building blocks of everything in the universe, and the neutrino is one 
of the smallest of the small. A million times less massive 
than an electron, neutrinos fly easily through matter,
unaffected by magnetic fields. In fact, they hardly ever 
interact with anything. That means that they can travel
through the universe in a straight line for millions, or even billions, of years, safely carrying information 
about where they came from. So where do they come from? Pretty much everywhere. They're produced in your body
from the radioactive decay of potassium. Cosmic rays hitting atoms 
in the Earth's atmosphere create showers of them. They're produced by nuclear 
reactions inside the sun and by radioactive 
decay inside the Earth. And we can generate them 
in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. But the highest energy neutrinos
are born far out in space in environments that 
we know very little about. Something out there,
maybe supermassive black holes, or maybe some cosmic dynamo
we've yet to discover, accelerates cosmic rays to energies
over a million times greater than anything human-built
accelerators have achieved. These cosmic rays, 
most of which are protons, interact violently with the matter
and radiation around them, producing high-energy neutrinos, which propagate out 
like cosmic breadcrumbs that can tell us about the locations and interiors of the universe's most
powerful cosmic engines. That is, if we can catch them. Neutrinos' limited interactions
with other matter might make them great messengers, but it also makes them 
extremely hard to detect. One way to do so is to put a huge volume
of pure transparent material in their path and wait for a neutrino to reveal itself by colliding with the nucleus of an atom. That's what's happening 
in Antarctica at IceCube, the world's largest neutrino telescope. It's set up within 
a cubic kilometer of ice that has been purified by the pressure of thousands of years 
of accumulated ice and snow, to the point where it's one 
of the clearest solids on Earth. And even though it's shot through with
boreholes holding over 5,000 detectors, most of the cosmic neutrinos racing
through IceCube will never leave a trace. But about ten times a year, a single high-energy neutrino
collides with a molecule of ice, shooting off sparks of charged
subatomic particles that travel faster through the ice
than light does. In a similar way to how a jet
that exceeds the speed of sound produces a sonic boom, these superluminal charged particles
leave behind a cone of blue light, kind of a photonic boom. This light spreads through IceCube, hitting some of its detectors
located over a mile beneath the surface. Photomultiplier tubes amplify the signal, which contains information about 
the charged particles' paths and energies. The data are beamed 
to astrophysicists around the world who look at the patterns of light for clues about the neutrinos 
that produced them. These super energetic collisions
are so rare that IceCube's scientists give each
neutrino nicknames, like Big Bird and Dr. Strangepork. IceCube has already observed the highest energy 
cosmic neutrinos ever seen. The neutrinos it detects should finally
tell us where cosmic rays come from and how they reached 
such extreme energies. Light, from infrared,
to x-rays, to gamma rays, has given us increasingly energetic and continuously surprising 
views of the universe. We are now at the dawn
of the age of neutrino astronomy, and we have no idea 
what revelations IceCube and other neutrino telescopes may bring us about the universe's most violent,
most energetic phenomena.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 5 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 3 is the closest. The ground truth MCQ asks about the location of IceCube, and the correct answer is related to the fact that a huge volume of pure transparent material is needed to detect neutrinos. Question 3 asks about the main challenge in detecting neutrinos, and the correct answer is related to their limited interactions with other matter, which is the reason why a large detector like IceCube is needed.

But if I had to choose a question that is more similar in terms of options and content, I would say that Question 4 is not the closest, but Question 5 has an option that is similar to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ.

The correct answer of the ground truth MCQ is A, which mentions that a cubic kilometer detector is needed to detect even a few cosmic neutrinos. Option B of Question 5 mentions that scientists detect neutrinos by detecting the charged particles produced by the neutrinos as they interact with the ice, which is related to the fact that a large detector like IceCube is needed to detect neutrinos.

However, I found that Question 8 has an option that is more similar to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ. Option C of Question 8 mentions that IceCube and other neutrino telescopes can reveal the locations and interiors of the universe's most powerful cosmic engines, which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, but Option A of Question 8 is not the correct answer, and it mentions that IceCube and other neutrino telescopes can reveal the formation of stars and galaxies, but another option could be that a huge volume of pure transparent material is needed to detect even a few cosmic neutrinos.

So, I decided to analyze the questions again, and I found that Question 5 is still not the most similar, but I can see that the correct answer of the ground truth MCQ is more related to the fact that a large detector like IceCube is needed to detect neutrinos. So, I looked for a question that has an option that is more similar to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ, and I found that Question 3 has an option that is not similar, but Question 4 has an option that is not similar, but Question 5 has an option that is similar, but not the most similar.

I decided to analyze the questions again, and I can see that Question 4 is not the most similar, but it has an option that is similar to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ. However, I can see that Question 5 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and options.

However, after analyzing the questions again, I can see that Question 4 is still not the most similar, but Question 5 is more similar. However, I can see that Question 3 is more related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent.

However, I decided to analyze the questions again, and I found that Question 3 is still more related to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, but Question 5 is more similar in terms of content and options.

**Transcript**:
This is a kindergarten
we designed in 2007. We made this kindergarten 
to be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation
on top of the roof. If you are a parent, you know that kids love
to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this? The principal of this kindergarten said, "No, I don't want a handrail." I said, "It's impossible." But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof? So that it can catch
the children falling off?" (Laughter) I said, "It's impossible." And of course,
the government official said, "Of course you have to have a handrail." But we could keep 
that idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call 
this rope as a handrail. But of course, rope has nothing
to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more, and more, more. (Laughter) Sometimes 40 children 
are around a tree. The boy on the branch, he loves the tree
so he is eating the tree. (Laughter) And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. (Laughter) Feeding time. (Laughter) 
(Applause) And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see
children on top of the roof, not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high,
you see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place --
there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water
to your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's putting water into his boots. (Laughter) This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year. And there is no boundary
between inside and outside. So it means basically
this architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary
between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back. (Laughter) But the point is,
in that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. But here, just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly, we consider
noise very important. You know that children
sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten, these children show
amazing concentration in class. And you know, our kind grew up
in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know, you can talk
to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know, these days we are trying to make
everything under control. You know, it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is 50 degrees. And also, you should know
that you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So, children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. (Laughter) I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always 
some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish
another monkey from above. (Laughter) Monkeys. (Laughter) And each classroom has
at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus
comes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building, right next to that
oval-shaped kindergarten. The building is only
five meters tall with seven floors. And of course,
the ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So, we put our children,
a daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. (Laughter) And he is trying to see
if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful
in Tokyo, as you know. (Laughter) The driver in front,
she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days, kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of
opportunity we are losing these days. Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten
do 4,000 meters on average. And these children have
the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says, "I don't train them.
We leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep." (Laughter) They keep running. (Laughter) My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable
of changing this world, and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts
to change the lives of children. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Imagine the brain could reboot, updating its withered and damaged cells
with new, improved units. That may sound like science fiction, but it's a potential reality
scientists are investigating right now. Will our brains one day 
be able to self-repair? It's well known that embryonic cells
in our young developing brains produce new neurons, the microscopic units 
that make up the brain's tissue. Those newly generated neurons migrate
to various parts of the developing brain, making it self-organize 
into different structures. But until recently, scientists thought cell production came to
an abrupt halt soon after this initial growth, leading them to conclude 
that neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and damaging events, like strokes,
are irreversible. But a series of recent discoveries has revealed that adult brains 
actually do continue to produce new cells in at least three specialized locations. This process, known as neurogenesis, involves dedicated brain cells,
called neural stem cells and progenitor cells, which manufacture new neurons
or replace the old ones. The three regions where neurogenesis
has been discovered are the dentate gyrus,
associated with learning and memory, the subventricular zone, which may
supply neurons to the olfactory bulb for communication 
between the nose and brain, and the striatum, 
which helps manage movement. Scientists don't yet have a good grasp
on exactly what role neurogenesis plays 
in any of these regions, or why they have this ability 
that's absent from the rest of the brain, but the mere presence of a mechanism
to grown new neurons in the adult brain opens up an amazing possibility. Could we harness that mechanism
to get the brain to heal its scars similar to how new skin
grows to patch up a wound, or a broken bone 
stitches itself back together? So here's where we stand. Certain proteins and other small molecules
that mimick those proteins can be administered to the brain to make neural stem cells 
and progenitor cells produce more neurons 
in those three locations. This technique still needs improvement so that the cells 
reproduce more efficiently and more cells survive. But research shows that progenitor cells
from these areas can actually migrate to places where
injury has occurred and give rise to new neurons there. And another promising possible approach is to transplant healthy 
human neural stem cells, which are cultured in a laboratory,
to injured tissue, like we can do with skin. Scientists are currently experimenting to determine whether transplanted
donor cells can divide, differentiate and successfully give rise 
to new neurons in a damaged brain. They've also discovered that we might be able to teach
other kinds of brain cells, such as astrocytes
or oligodendrocytes to behave like neural stem cells
and start generating neurons, too. So, a couple of decades from now
will our brains be able to self-repair? We can't say for sure, but that has become one of the major 
goals of regenerative medicine. The human brain has 100 billion neurons and we're still figuring out the wiring
behind this huge biological motherboard. But everyday, research on neurogenesis
brings us closer to that reboot switch.

**Transcript**:
Imagine the brain could reboot, updating its withered and damaged cells
with new, improved units. That may sound like science fiction, but it's a potential reality
scientists are investigating right now. Will our brains one day 
be able to self-repair? It's well known that embryonic cells
in our young developing brains produce new neurons, the microscopic units 
that make up the brain's tissue. Those newly generated neurons migrate
to various parts of the developing brain, making it self-organize 
into different structures. But until recently, scientists thought cell production came to
an abrupt halt soon after this initial growth, leading them to conclude 
that neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and damaging events, like strokes,
are irreversible. But a series of recent discoveries has revealed that adult brains 
actually do continue to produce new cells in at least three specialized locations. This process, known as neurogenesis, involves dedicated brain cells,
called neural stem cells and progenitor cells, which manufacture new neurons
or replace the old ones. The three regions where neurogenesis
has been discovered are the dentate gyrus,
associated with learning and memory, the subventricular zone, which may
supply neurons to the olfactory bulb for communication 
between the nose and brain, and the striatum, 
which helps manage movement. Scientists don't yet have a good grasp
on exactly what role neurogenesis plays 
in any of these regions, or why they have this ability 
that's absent from the rest of the brain, but the mere presence of a mechanism
to grown new neurons in the adult brain opens up an amazing possibility. Could we harness that mechanism
to get the brain to heal its scars similar to how new skin
grows to patch up a wound, or a broken bone 
stitches itself back together? So here's where we stand. Certain proteins and other small molecules
that mimick those proteins can be administered to the brain to make neural stem cells 
and progenitor cells produce more neurons 
in those three locations. This technique still needs improvement so that the cells 
reproduce more efficiently and more cells survive. But research shows that progenitor cells
from these areas can actually migrate to places where
injury has occurred and give rise to new neurons there. And another promising possible approach is to transplant healthy 
human neural stem cells, which are cultured in a laboratory,
to injured tissue, like we can do with skin. Scientists are currently experimenting to determine whether transplanted
donor cells can divide, differentiate and successfully give rise 
to new neurons in a damaged brain. They've also discovered that we might be able to teach
other kinds of brain cells, such as astrocytes
or oligodendrocytes to behave like neural stem cells
and start generating neurons, too. So, a couple of decades from now
will our brains be able to self-repair? We can't say for sure, but that has become one of the major 
goals of regenerative medicine. The human brain has 100 billion neurons and we're still figuring out the wiring
behind this huge biological motherboard. But everyday, research on neurogenesis
brings us closer to that reboot switch.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the brain region that plays a role in learning and memory. The correct answer is the hippocampus, but the transcript specifically mentions the dentate gyrus, which is a part of the hippocampus.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4: What are the three regions where neurogenesis has been discovered? Options: A. The hippocampus, the amygdala, and the prefrontal cortex, B. The dentate gyrus, the subventricular zone, and the striatum, C. The cerebellum, the brainstem, and the spinal cord, D. The olfactory bulb, the hypothalamus, and the thalamus Correct Option: B

Although this question is not asking directly about the brain region involved in learning and memory, it does mention the dentate gyrus, which is related to the hippocampus and plays a role in learning and memory.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, but it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
If you could choose one vegetable to serve a king, what would it be? The extravagant French king Louis XIV demanded that cauliflower be served at all his feasts. It had something to do with a girlfriend who liked cauliflower... but maybe he knew that this common member of the cabbage family has a positively royal pedigree - when it comes to health: one cup of cauliflower has more Vitamin C than an orange; it's high in fiber, which helps digestion; and it's packed with cancer fighting antioxidants. When we eat cauliflower, we're actually eating a flower! In fact, we're eating hundreds of immature flowers that are bonded together into little lumps called curds. China and India throw the most cauliflower, but in the US, it's California - and that's where we've come to find out: How Does It Grow? We're here in Watsonville, Santa Cruz, at Lakeside Organic Gardens - one of the country's largest family-owned organic farms. Lakeside grows many different crops, including five million heads of cauliflower each year. First, they prepare the earth with fertilizer. (Dick): In our business we have a saying: "We farm the soil, and the soil grows the crop." Because lakeside grows their cauliflower organically, that means they don't use chemical sprays to kill the bugs that eat the cauliflower plant; instead, they release predators like ladybugs that like to eat the bad insects. (Dick): We grow plants that attract the good bugs. (Nicole): Is that like these white flowers that you see here? (Dick): Yeah, these are Sweet Alyssum. So you'll see them around the edge of our field. They also use a natural soap spray, since bugs breathe through their skin when the soap covers their body they suffocate. But there's another secret to growing cauliflower organically: penguin poop. Lakeside is the country's largest importer of Peruvian Guano - aka seabird excrement. Guano is used as a fertilizer and is super rich in nitrogen because of all the fish those seabirds eat. And nitrogen is key to plant growth - it's a main ingredient in chlorophyll - the substance that plants make to convert sunlight to energy. When the cauliflower is the size of a tennis ball, farmers take some of the biggest leaves, and tie them over the head. They do this for one reason only: we like our cauliflower white. If the head is exposed to the sun, it turns yellow and even though it tastes exactly the same, we won't buy it! (Dick): what we throw away in California for cosmetic reasons could end World Hunger... When the cauliflower is 6 to 8 inches in diameter, the harvest begins. Right in the field, the cauliflower is trimmed and wrapped. Before being shipped, it will be cooled down to preserve its freshness. If the cauliflower is harvested too late, the curds begin to pull apart within just two days - that's when you can really see how the cauliflower is just a big bouquet of flowers waiting to bloom. Cauliflower is delicious. Cut up and roasted in the oven at high heat - the natural sugars caramelize, it gets tender and sweet. But for the love of God, don't boil it - it'll turn to mush! And that is no way to treat a vegetable fit for a king

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, Question 3 is not an exact match because it asks how Lakeside Organic Gardens grows their cauliflower organically, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks which substance is prohibited in organic farming. 

A closer examination of the options in Question 3 reveals that option C in the ground truth MCQ (Chemical sprays) is mentioned as something that Lakeside Organic Gardens does not use, in the context of Question 3.

But a more accurate match can be found in none of the questions. However, Question 3's option A and B can be considered as the opposite of what is asked in the ground truth MCQ and option C of the ground truth MCQ can be matched with the content of Question 3.

However, if we were to choose the closest match based on the content, Question 3 would be the closest match.

All of the above Correct Option: D.

However, an even more similar match can be found in the options of Question 3. Option A of Question 3 is "By releasing ladybugs to eat the bad insects," which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ. 

But since we are looking for a more direct match in the question content, a more suitable match can be found in Question 4: What is the purpose of using Sweet Alyssum flowers in the cauliflower field? Options: A. To attract bees for pollination, B. To attract ladybugs to eat the bad insects, C. To provide a natural barrier for the cauliflower plants, D. To improve soil quality Correct Option: B.

However, this question is about Sweet Alyssum flowers and not directly about ladybugs.

A more suitable match is not found as the question is about the role of ladybugs. However, Question 3 has an option that describes the role of ladybugs.

Considering all the options, the most suitable match is Question 3, but it does not directly ask about ladybugs.

However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that Question 3 has an option that directly matches the ground truth MCQ's correct option.

But if we only consider the options of the generated MCQs, a direct match can be found in option A of Question 3 and option B of Question 4.

However, if we consider the intent of the question, a direct match is not found but a match is found in the options.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
If you could choose one vegetable to serve a king, what would it be? The extravagant French king Louis XIV demanded that cauliflower be served at all his feasts. It had something to do with a girlfriend who liked cauliflower... but maybe he knew that this common member of the cabbage family has a positively royal pedigree - when it comes to health: one cup of cauliflower has more Vitamin C than an orange; it's high in fiber, which helps digestion; and it's packed with cancer fighting antioxidants. When we eat cauliflower, we're actually eating a flower! In fact, we're eating hundreds of immature flowers that are bonded together into little lumps called curds. China and India throw the most cauliflower, but in the US, it's California - and that's where we've come to find out: How Does It Grow? We're here in Watsonville, Santa Cruz, at Lakeside Organic Gardens - one of the country's largest family-owned organic farms. Lakeside grows many different crops, including five million heads of cauliflower each year. First, they prepare the earth with fertilizer. (Dick): In our business we have a saying: "We farm the soil, and the soil grows the crop." Because lakeside grows their cauliflower organically, that means they don't use chemical sprays to kill the bugs that eat the cauliflower plant; instead, they release predators like ladybugs that like to eat the bad insects. (Dick): We grow plants that attract the good bugs. (Nicole): Is that like these white flowers that you see here? (Dick): Yeah, these are Sweet Alyssum. So you'll see them around the edge of our field. They also use a natural soap spray, since bugs breathe through their skin when the soap covers their body they suffocate. But there's another secret to growing cauliflower organically: penguin poop. Lakeside is the country's largest importer of Peruvian Guano - aka seabird excrement. Guano is used as a fertilizer and is super rich in nitrogen because of all the fish those seabirds eat. And nitrogen is key to plant growth - it's a main ingredient in chlorophyll - the substance that plants make to convert sunlight to energy. When the cauliflower is the size of a tennis ball, farmers take some of the biggest leaves, and tie them over the head. They do this for one reason only: we like our cauliflower white. If the head is exposed to the sun, it turns yellow and even though it tastes exactly the same, we won't buy it! (Dick): what we throw away in California for cosmetic reasons could end World Hunger... When the cauliflower is 6 to 8 inches in diameter, the harvest begins. Right in the field, the cauliflower is trimmed and wrapped. Before being shipped, it will be cooled down to preserve its freshness. If the cauliflower is harvested too late, the curds begin to pull apart within just two days - that's when you can really see how the cauliflower is just a big bouquet of flowers waiting to bloom. Cauliflower is delicious. Cut up and roasted in the oven at high heat - the natural sugars caramelize, it gets tender and sweet. But for the love of God, don't boil it - it'll turn to mush! And that is no way to treat a vegetable fit for a king

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 11. 

This question has the same intent as the ground truth MCQ, which is to determine why farmers wrap or tie leaves around the heads of cauliflower as they mature. The correct option for Question 11, "To keep it white and prevent it from turning yellow," is similar to the correct option for the ground truth MCQ, "To shield them from sun." Both options convey the idea that the leaves are used to protect the cauliflower from the sun's effects, which would cause it to turn yellow.

Although Question 6 also deals with the effect of sunlight on cauliflower, it does not specifically address the reason for tying leaves around the head, making Question 11 a more suitable match for the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 11.

**Transcript**:
If you could choose one vegetable to serve a king, what would it be? The extravagant French king Louis XIV demanded that cauliflower be served at all his feasts. It had something to do with a girlfriend who liked cauliflower... but maybe he knew that this common member of the cabbage family has a positively royal pedigree - when it comes to health: one cup of cauliflower has more Vitamin C than an orange; it's high in fiber, which helps digestion; and it's packed with cancer fighting antioxidants. When we eat cauliflower, we're actually eating a flower! In fact, we're eating hundreds of immature flowers that are bonded together into little lumps called curds. China and India throw the most cauliflower, but in the US, it's California - and that's where we've come to find out: How Does It Grow? We're here in Watsonville, Santa Cruz, at Lakeside Organic Gardens - one of the country's largest family-owned organic farms. Lakeside grows many different crops, including five million heads of cauliflower each year. First, they prepare the earth with fertilizer. (Dick): In our business we have a saying: "We farm the soil, and the soil grows the crop." Because lakeside grows their cauliflower organically, that means they don't use chemical sprays to kill the bugs that eat the cauliflower plant; instead, they release predators like ladybugs that like to eat the bad insects. (Dick): We grow plants that attract the good bugs. (Nicole): Is that like these white flowers that you see here? (Dick): Yeah, these are Sweet Alyssum. So you'll see them around the edge of our field. They also use a natural soap spray, since bugs breathe through their skin when the soap covers their body they suffocate. But there's another secret to growing cauliflower organically: penguin poop. Lakeside is the country's largest importer of Peruvian Guano - aka seabird excrement. Guano is used as a fertilizer and is super rich in nitrogen because of all the fish those seabirds eat. And nitrogen is key to plant growth - it's a main ingredient in chlorophyll - the substance that plants make to convert sunlight to energy. When the cauliflower is the size of a tennis ball, farmers take some of the biggest leaves, and tie them over the head. They do this for one reason only: we like our cauliflower white. If the head is exposed to the sun, it turns yellow and even though it tastes exactly the same, we won't buy it! (Dick): what we throw away in California for cosmetic reasons could end World Hunger... When the cauliflower is 6 to 8 inches in diameter, the harvest begins. Right in the field, the cauliflower is trimmed and wrapped. Before being shipped, it will be cooled down to preserve its freshness. If the cauliflower is harvested too late, the curds begin to pull apart within just two days - that's when you can really see how the cauliflower is just a big bouquet of flowers waiting to bloom. Cauliflower is delicious. Cut up and roasted in the oven at high heat - the natural sugars caramelize, it gets tender and sweet. But for the love of God, don't boil it - it'll turn to mush! And that is no way to treat a vegetable fit for a king

**Transcript**:
It's so obvious 
that it's practically proverbial. You can't unboil an egg. Well, it turns out you can, sort of. What thermal energy 
does to the eggs' molecules, mechanical energy can undo. Eggs are mostly made 
of water and proteins. The proteins start off 
folded up into intricate shapes, held together by weak chemical bonds. Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold,
uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing. The newly liberated proteins 
bump up against their neighbors and start to form 
new bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled
that they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg. That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not. According to a chemical idea called the principle 
of microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, 
like egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen
if you retrace your steps. But adding more heat will tangle
the proteins further, and cooling them down
will only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast. I'm not kidding. Here's how it works. First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,
coating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them 
to glide past each other. Then, they spin that solution 
in a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution 
spread out into a thin film. Here's the key part. The solution nearest
the wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle. That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch 
and contract the proteins until eventually they snap back
into their native shapes and stay there. By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back 
in its original unboiled state. This technique works 
with all sorts of proteins. Bigger, messier proteins can be
more resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress
and encourages it to fold up first. This unboiling method won't work
with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread
throughout a cylindrical chamber. But the applications go way beyond
uncooking your breakfast, anyhow. Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins
that are extremely expensive to produce, partly because they get stuck 
in tangled up aggregates, just like cooked egg whites and have to be untangled and refolded
before they can do their jobs. This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier, cheaper 
and quicker method than other ways to refold proteins, so it may allow new drugs to be made
available to more people faster. And there's one more thing 
you need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food. Boiling an egg is actually
an unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way
proteins are shaped and bound together, it doesn't actually change 
their chemical identity. Most types of cooking are more like
the famous Maillard reaction, which makes chemical changes that turn sugars and proteins
into delicious caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo. So you might be able to unboil your egg, but I'm sorry to say 
you can't unfry it...yet.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
It's so obvious 
that it's practically proverbial. You can't unboil an egg. Well, it turns out you can, sort of. What thermal energy 
does to the eggs' molecules, mechanical energy can undo. Eggs are mostly made 
of water and proteins. The proteins start off 
folded up into intricate shapes, held together by weak chemical bonds. Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold,
uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing. The newly liberated proteins 
bump up against their neighbors and start to form 
new bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled
that they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg. That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not. According to a chemical idea called the principle 
of microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, 
like egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen
if you retrace your steps. But adding more heat will tangle
the proteins further, and cooling them down
will only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast. I'm not kidding. Here's how it works. First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,
coating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them 
to glide past each other. Then, they spin that solution 
in a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution 
spread out into a thin film. Here's the key part. The solution nearest
the wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle. That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch 
and contract the proteins until eventually they snap back
into their native shapes and stay there. By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back 
in its original unboiled state. This technique works 
with all sorts of proteins. Bigger, messier proteins can be
more resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress
and encourages it to fold up first. This unboiling method won't work
with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread
throughout a cylindrical chamber. But the applications go way beyond
uncooking your breakfast, anyhow. Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins
that are extremely expensive to produce, partly because they get stuck 
in tangled up aggregates, just like cooked egg whites and have to be untangled and refolded
before they can do their jobs. This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier, cheaper 
and quicker method than other ways to refold proteins, so it may allow new drugs to be made
available to more people faster. And there's one more thing 
you need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food. Boiling an egg is actually
an unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way
proteins are shaped and bound together, it doesn't actually change 
their chemical identity. Most types of cooking are more like
the famous Maillard reaction, which makes chemical changes that turn sugars and proteins
into delicious caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo. So you might be able to unboil your egg, but I'm sorry to say 
you can't unfry it...yet.

**Transcript**:
It's so obvious 
that it's practically proverbial. You can't unboil an egg. Well, it turns out you can, sort of. What thermal energy 
does to the eggs' molecules, mechanical energy can undo. Eggs are mostly made 
of water and proteins. The proteins start off 
folded up into intricate shapes, held together by weak chemical bonds. Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold,
uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing. The newly liberated proteins 
bump up against their neighbors and start to form 
new bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled
that they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg. That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not. According to a chemical idea called the principle 
of microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, 
like egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen
if you retrace your steps. But adding more heat will tangle
the proteins further, and cooling them down
will only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast. I'm not kidding. Here's how it works. First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,
coating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them 
to glide past each other. Then, they spin that solution 
in a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution 
spread out into a thin film. Here's the key part. The solution nearest
the wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle. That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch 
and contract the proteins until eventually they snap back
into their native shapes and stay there. By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back 
in its original unboiled state. This technique works 
with all sorts of proteins. Bigger, messier proteins can be
more resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress
and encourages it to fold up first. This unboiling method won't work
with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread
throughout a cylindrical chamber. But the applications go way beyond
uncooking your breakfast, anyhow. Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins
that are extremely expensive to produce, partly because they get stuck 
in tangled up aggregates, just like cooked egg whites and have to be untangled and refolded
before they can do their jobs. This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier, cheaper 
and quicker method than other ways to refold proteins, so it may allow new drugs to be made
available to more people faster. And there's one more thing 
you need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food. Boiling an egg is actually
an unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way
proteins are shaped and bound together, it doesn't actually change 
their chemical identity. Most types of cooking are more like
the famous Maillard reaction, which makes chemical changes that turn sugars and proteins
into delicious caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo. So you might be able to unboil your egg, but I'm sorry to say 
you can't unfry it...yet.

**Transcript**:
It's estimated that 
for every 10,000 bills in the U.S., one of those bills is fake. That may not sound like much, but it adds up to millions of dollars
in cold hard cash. Counterfeit money has the potential
to cause all sorts of problems, from leaving you short $20
to destabilizing national economies. But don't worry. You can help catch the counterfeits. All you need are some simple tools
and a bit of chemistry. First up, the anti-counterfeit 
detection pen. The pen looks like a highlighter and contains a solution 
of potassium iodide and elemental iodine. It reveals of the presence of starch, which is commonly used 
to strengthen regular printer paper, but won't be found in real money. That's because authentic bills
are made of cotton and linen and are threaded with tiny 
red and blue fibers. That material is made by a single,
highly-guarded company called Crane and Company, which has been printing currency since Paul Revere asked them 
to help finance the Revolutionary War. The starch in many counterfeit bills,
on the other hand, is made of two molecules: amylopectin and amylose. It's amylose that gives the fake away. Its long chain of sugar molecules
connected by oxygen atoms forms a helical structure, like DNA. Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil, forming a new compound
that leaves a dark mark on the paper. However, in the absence of starch,
there is no chemical reaction and the mark will look light yellow. So if the fake isn't printed 
on starchy paper, iodine solutions can't help you. That's one of the reasons 
U.S. bills printed since 1996 have been chemically enhanced to include
another counterfeit countermeasure: a strip that fluoresces under UV light. That's the same kind of light
used at black light parties and airport security lines. The polyester strip 
printed with invisble ink is just one millimeter wide and is found in different positions
depending on a bill's value. If you hold your dollar 
up to natural light, you can see the amount 
and the word USA printed on the band. But under UV light, 
these strips really shine. They contain molecules that can be excited
by absorbing certain amounts of energy, specifically, that given off 
by common UV light sources. As these excited molecules return
to their original states, they lose a bit of energy as heat
and then radiate the rest as light. Energy is inversely related to wavelength, which means that the longer wavelengths
have lower energy. So the lower energy light 
given off by the strip means longer wavelengths
that fall in the visible range, and suddenly we can see that 
which had been invisible. And if a glowing strip doesn't show up
on a recent bill, you have a fake on your hands. For times when you're not dealing 
with counterfeit masterminds, looking for simple visual cues will do. Make sure the portrait 
looks lifelike and not flat, the seal has perfectly 
even sawtooth points, the inked border is unbroken, and the serial number has precisely 
equal spacing between each number. So the next time you come across 
some dubious dough, have a closer look, pull out your iodine solution, or take it to a rave and you just might catch a counterfeit.

**Transcript**:
It's estimated that 
for every 10,000 bills in the U.S., one of those bills is fake. That may not sound like much, but it adds up to millions of dollars
in cold hard cash. Counterfeit money has the potential
to cause all sorts of problems, from leaving you short $20
to destabilizing national economies. But don't worry. You can help catch the counterfeits. All you need are some simple tools
and a bit of chemistry. First up, the anti-counterfeit 
detection pen. The pen looks like a highlighter and contains a solution 
of potassium iodide and elemental iodine. It reveals of the presence of starch, which is commonly used 
to strengthen regular printer paper, but won't be found in real money. That's because authentic bills
are made of cotton and linen and are threaded with tiny 
red and blue fibers. That material is made by a single,
highly-guarded company called Crane and Company, which has been printing currency since Paul Revere asked them 
to help finance the Revolutionary War. The starch in many counterfeit bills,
on the other hand, is made of two molecules: amylopectin and amylose. It's amylose that gives the fake away. Its long chain of sugar molecules
connected by oxygen atoms forms a helical structure, like DNA. Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil, forming a new compound
that leaves a dark mark on the paper. However, in the absence of starch,
there is no chemical reaction and the mark will look light yellow. So if the fake isn't printed 
on starchy paper, iodine solutions can't help you. That's one of the reasons 
U.S. bills printed since 1996 have been chemically enhanced to include
another counterfeit countermeasure: a strip that fluoresces under UV light. That's the same kind of light
used at black light parties and airport security lines. The polyester strip 
printed with invisble ink is just one millimeter wide and is found in different positions
depending on a bill's value. If you hold your dollar 
up to natural light, you can see the amount 
and the word USA printed on the band. But under UV light, 
these strips really shine. They contain molecules that can be excited
by absorbing certain amounts of energy, specifically, that given off 
by common UV light sources. As these excited molecules return
to their original states, they lose a bit of energy as heat
and then radiate the rest as light. Energy is inversely related to wavelength, which means that the longer wavelengths
have lower energy. So the lower energy light 
given off by the strip means longer wavelengths
that fall in the visible range, and suddenly we can see that 
which had been invisible. And if a glowing strip doesn't show up
on a recent bill, you have a fake on your hands. For times when you're not dealing 
with counterfeit masterminds, looking for simple visual cues will do. Make sure the portrait 
looks lifelike and not flat, the seal has perfectly 
even sawtooth points, the inked border is unbroken, and the serial number has precisely 
equal spacing between each number. So the next time you come across 
some dubious dough, have a closer look, pull out your iodine solution, or take it to a rave and you just might catch a counterfeit.

**Transcript**:
As the story goes, 
the legendary marksman William Tell was forced into a cruel challenge
by a corrupt lord. William's son was to be executed unless William could shoot 
an apple off his head. William succeeded, but let's imagine
two variations on the tale. In the first variation, the lord hires a bandit to steal
William's trusty crossbow, so he is forced to borrow
an inferior one from a peasant. However, the borrowed crossbow
isn't adjusted perfectly, and William finds that his practice shots cluster in a tight spread 
beneath the bullseye. Fortunately, he has time 
to correct for it before it's too late. Variation two: William begins to doubt his skills
in the long hours before the challenge and his hand develops a tremor. His practice shots still cluster
around the apple but in a random pattern. Occasionally, he hits the apple, but with the wobble,
there is no guarantee of a bullseye. He must settle his nervous hand and restore the certainty in his aim
to save his son. At the heart of these variations
are two terms often used interchangeably: accuracy and precision. The distinction between the two is actually critical 
for many scientific endeavours. Accuracy involves how close you come
to the correct result. Your accuracy improves with tools
that are calibrated correctly and that you're well-trained on. Precision, on the other hand, is how consistently you can get 
that result using the same method. Your precision improves 
with more finely incremented tools that require less estimation. The story of the stolen crossbow
was one of precision without accuracy. William got the same wrong result
each time he fired. The variation with the shaky hand
was one of accuracy without precision. William's bolts clustered 
around the correct result, but without certainty of a bullseye
for any given shot. You can probably get away 
with low accuracy or low precision in everyday tasks. But engineers and researchers
often require accuracy on microscopic levels with 
a high certainty of being right every time. Factories and labs increase precision through better equipment 
and more detailed procedures. These improvements can be expensive,
so managers must decide what the acceptable uncertainty 
for each project is. However, investments in precision can take us beyond 
what was previously possible, even as far as Mars. It may surprise you that NASA
does not know exactly where their probes are going to touch down
on another planet. Predicting where they will land
requires extensive calculations fed by measurements 
that don't always have a precise answer. How does the Martian atmosphere's density
change at different elevations? What angle will the probe
hit the atmosphere at? What will be the speed 
of the probe upon entry? Computer simulators run thousands
of different landing scenarios, mixing and matching values
for all of the variables. Weighing all the possibilities, the computer spits out 
the potential area of impact in the form of a landing ellipse. In 1976, the landing ellipse
for the Mars Viking Lander was 62 x 174 miles,
nearly the area of New Jersey. With such a limitation, NASA had to ignore many interesting
but risky landing areas. Since then, new information 
about the Martian atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations
have drastically reduced uncertainty. In 2012, the landing ellipse 
for the Curiosity Lander was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long, an area more than 200 times 
smaller than Viking's. This allowed NASA to target 
a specific spot in Gale Crater, a previously un-landable area 
of high scientific interest. While we ultimately strive for accuracy, precision reflects our certainty
of reliably achieving it. With these two principles in mind, we can shoot for the stars and be confident 
of hitting them every time.

beneath the bullseye. Fortunately, he has time 
to correct for it before it's too late. Variation two: William begins to doubt his skills
in the long hours before the challenge and his hand develops a tremor. His practice shots still cluster
around the apple but in a random pattern. Occasionally, he hits the apple, but with the wobble,
there is no guarantee of a bullseye. He must settle his nervous hand and restore the certainty in his aim
to save his son. At the heart of these variations
are two terms often used interchangeably: accuracy and precision. The distinction between the two is actually critical 
for many scientific endeavours. Accuracy involves how close you come
to the correct result. Your accuracy improves with tools
that are calibrated correctly and that you're well-trained on. Precision, on the other hand, is how consistently you can get 
that result using the same method. Your precision improves 
with more finely incremented tools that require less estimation. The story of the stolen crossbow
was one of precision without accuracy. William got the same wrong result
each time he fired. The variation with the shaky hand
was one of accuracy without precision. William's bolts clustered 
around the correct result, but without certainty of a bullseye
for any given shot. You can probably get away 
with low accuracy or low precision in everyday tasks. But engineers and researchers
often require accuracy on microscopic levels with 
a high certainty of being right every time. Factories and labs increase precision through better equipment 
and more detailed procedures. These improvements can be expensive,
so managers must decide what the acceptable uncertainty 
for each project is. However, investments in precision can take us beyond 
what was previously possible, even as far as Mars. It may surprise you that NASA
does not know exactly where their probes are going to touch down
on another planet. Predicting where they will land
requires extensive calculations fed by measurements 
that don't always have a precise answer. How does the Martian atmosphere's density
change at different elevations? What angle will the probe
hit the atmosphere at? What will be the speed 
of the probe upon entry? Computer simulators run thousands
of different landing scenarios, mixing and matching values
for all of the variables. Weighing all the possibilities, the computer spits out 
the potential area of impact in the form of a landing ellipse. In 1976, the landing ellipse
for the Mars Viking Lander was 62 x 174 miles,
nearly the area of New Jersey. With such a limitation, NASA had to ignore many interesting
but risky landing areas. Since then, new information 
about the Martian atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations
have drastically reduced uncertainty. In 2012, the landing ellipse 
for the Curiosity Lander was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long, an area more than 200 times 
smaller than Viking's. This allowed NASA to target 
a specific spot in Gale Crater, a previously un-landable area 
of high scientific interest. While we ultimately strive for accuracy, precision reflects our certainty
of reliably achieving it. With these two principles in mind, we can shoot for the stars and be confident 
of hitting them every time.

As the story goes, 
the legendary marksman William Tell was forced into a cruel challenge
by a corrupt lord. William's son was to be executed unless William could shoot 
an apple off his head. William succeeded, but let's imagine
two variations on the tale. In the first variation, the lord hires a bandit to steal
William's trusty crossbow, so he is forced to borrow
an inferior one from a peasant. However, the borrowed crossbow
isn't adjusted perfectly, and William finds that his practice shots cluster in a tight spread

**Transcript**:
Why are most manhole covers round? Sure, it makes them easy to roll
and slide into place in any alignment but there's another more compelling reason involving a peculiar geometric property
of circles and other shapes. Imagine a square 
separating two parallel lines. As it rotates, the lines first push apart,
then come back together. But try this with a circle and the lines stay 
exactly the same distance apart, the diameter of the circle. This makes the circle unlike the square, a mathematical shape 
called a curve of constant width. Another shape with this property
is the Reuleaux triangle. To create one, 
start with an equilateral triangle, then make one of the vertices the center
of a circle that touches the other two. Draw two more circles in the same way,
centered on the other two vertices, and there it is, in the space 
where they all overlap. Because Reuleaux triangles can rotate
between parallel lines without changing their distance, they can work as wheels,
provided a little creative engineering. And if you rotate one while rolling
its midpoint in a nearly circular path, its perimeter traces out a square
with rounded corners, allowing triangular drill bits
to carve out square holes. Any polygon with an odd number of sides can be used to generate 
a curve of constant width using the same method we applied earlier, though there are many others
that aren't made in this way. For example, if you roll any 
curve of constant width around another, you'll make a third one. This collection of pointy curves
fascinates mathematicians. They've given us Barbier's theorem, which says that the perimeter 
of any curve of constant width, not just a circle,
equals pi times the diameter. Another theorem tells us that if you had
a bunch of curves of constant width with the same width, they would all have the same perimeter, but the Reuleaux triangle 
would have the smallest area. The circle, which is effectively 
a Reuleaux polygon with an infinite number of sides,
has the largest. In three dimensions, we can make 
surfaces of constant width, like the Reuleaux tetrahedron, formed by taking a tetrahedron, expanding a sphere from each vertex
until it touches the opposite vertices, and throwing everything away
except the region where they overlap. Surfaces of constant width maintain a constant distance 
between two parallel planes. So you could throw a bunch 
of Reuleaux tetrahedra on the floor, and slide a board across them
as smoothly as if they were marbles. Now back to manhole covers. A square manhole cover's short edge could line up with the wider part 
of the hole and fall right in. But a curve of constant width
won't fall in any orientation. Usually they're circular, 
but keep your eyes open, and you just might come across 
a Reuleaux triangle manhole.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: The Reuleaux triangle _____.
Options: A. Is made from three circular arcs, B. Has constant width, C. Has a smaller area than any curve of constant width of the same width, D. All of the above

Why are most manhole covers round? Sure, it makes them easy to roll
and slide into place in any alignment but there's another more compelling reason involving a peculiar geometric property
of circles and other shapes. Imagine a square 
separating two parallel lines. As it rotates, the lines first push apart,
then come back together. But try this with a circle and the lines stay 
exactly the same distance apart, the diameter of the circle. This makes the circle unlike the square, a mathematical shape 
called a curve of constant width. Another shape with this property
is the Reuleaux triangle. To create one, 
start with an equilateral triangle, then make one of the vertices the center
of a circle that touches the other two. Draw two more circles in the same way,
centered on the other two vertices, and there it is, in the space 
where they all overlap. Because Reuleaux triangles can rotate
between parallel lines without changing their distance, they can work as wheels,
provided a little creative engineering. And if you rotate one while rolling
its midpoint in a nearly circular path, its perimeter traces out a square
with rounded corners, allowing triangular drill bits
to carve out square holes. Any polygon with an odd number of sides can be used to generate 
a curve of constant width using the same method we applied earlier, though there are many others
that aren't made in this way. For example, if you roll any 
curve of constant width around another, you'll make a third one. This collection of pointy curves
fascinates mathematicians. They've given us Barbier's theorem, which says that the perimeter 
of any curve of constant width, not just a circle,
equals pi times the diameter. Another theorem tells us that if you had
a bunch of curves of constant width with the same width, they would all have the same perimeter, but the Reuleaux triangle 
would have the smallest area. The circle, which is effectively 
a Reuleaux polygon with an infinite number of sides,
has the largest. In three dimensions, we can make 
surfaces of constant width, like the Reuleaux tetrahedron, formed by taking a tetrahedron, expanding a sphere from each vertex
until it touches the opposite vertices, and throwing everything away
except the region where they overlap. Surfaces of constant width maintain a constant distance 
between two parallel planes. So you could throw a bunch 
of Reuleaux tetrahedra on the floor, and slide a board across them
as smoothly as if they were marbles. Now back to manhole covers. A square manhole cover's short edge could line up with the wider part 
of the hole and fall right in. But a curve of constant width
won't fall in any orientation. Usually they're circular, 
but keep your eyes open, and you just might come across 
a Reuleaux triangle manhole.

at any moment. You may be walking across a soft carpet
and reaching for the door knob when suddenly...zap! To understand static electricity, we first need to know a bit
about the nature of matter. All matter is made up of atoms that consist of three 
types of smaller particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutral neutrons. Normally, the electrons and protons
in an atom balance out, which is why most matter you come across
is electrically neutral. But electrons are tiny 
and almost insignificant in mass, and rubbing or friction can give
loosely bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms
and attach to others, migrating between different surfaces. When this happens, the first object is left 
with more protons than electrons and becomes positively charged, while the one with more electrons
accumulates a negative charge. This situation is called
a charge imbalance, or net charge separation. But nature tends towards balance, so when one of these newly charged bodies
comes into contact with another material, the mobile electrons 
will take the first chance they get to go where they're most needed, either jumping off the negatively
charged object, or jumping onto 
the positively charged one in an attempt to restore 
the neutral charge equilibrium. And this quick movement of electrons,
called static discharge, is what we recognize as that sudden spark. This process doesn't happen 
with just any objects. Otherwise you'd be getting 
zapped all the time. Conductors like metals and salt water tend to have loosely 
bound outer electrons, which can easily flow between molecules. On the other hand, insulators 
like plastics, rubber and glass have tightly bound electrons
that won't readily jump to other atoms. Static build-up is most likely to occur when one of the materials involved
is an insulator. When you walk across a rug, electrons from your body
will rub off onto it, while the rug's insulating wool
will resist losing its own electrons. Although your body and the rug
together are still electrically neutral, there is now a charge polarization
between the two. And when you reach to touch the door knob, zap! The metal door knob's loosely 
bound electrons hop to your hand to replace the electrons 
your body has lost. When it happens in your bedroom,
it's a minor nuisance. But in the great outdoors, static electricity can be a terrifying,
destructive force of nature. In certain conditions,
charge separation will occur in clouds. We don't know exactly how this happens. It may have to do with the circulation
of water droplets and ice particles within them. Regardless, the charge 
imbalance is neutralized by being released towards another body, such as a building, the Earth, or another cloud in a giant spark
that we know as lightning. And just as your fingers can be zapped
over and over in the same spot, you better believe that lightning 
can strike the same place more than once.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable match would be Question 11, but the question content does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Considering all the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match in terms of question intent and content. However, if we look at the options provided, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If we were to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question content, options, and overall intent, it would be Question 2, but with some modifications to the options to match the ground truth MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 12's option D, which mentions the movement of electrons to "restore the neutral charge equilibrium." 

But if we were to choose a generated MCQ that directly answers the ground truth MCQ, it would be Question 2 with the correct option being the opposite (gains electrons) of what is stated.

Since none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 2 has the closest intent, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 2, assuming the correct option is the opposite (A. It gains electrons) of what is stated.

However, another generated MCQ, Question 5's explanation and Question 12's option D, also relate to the concept described in the ground truth MCQ's correct option.

Considering the question content and options, a new generated MCQ that directly answers the ground truth MCQ would be the best match.

However, if we were to choose from the existing generated MCQs, the index of the most similar generated MCQ would be 2.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2: What happens when an object becomes positively charged due to a charge imbalance?

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the role of friction in causing electrons to jump from one material to another, which is not directly addressed by any of the generated MCQs.

That being said, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say it is Question 12: What happens to the mobile electrons when a charged object comes into contact with another material? This question is related to the concept of electrons moving from one material to another, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, the question intent and options are not identical.

**Transcript**:
There is a curse that has plagued humanity
since ancient times. The Greeks fought it by chewing
aromatic resins, while the Chinese resorted to egg shells. In the ancient Jewish Talmud, it's even considered 
legal grounds for divorce. This horrible scourge is halitosis,
otherwise known as bad breath. But what causes it,
and why is it so universally terrifying? Well, think of some of the worst
odors you can imagine, like garbage, feces or rotting meat. All of these smells come from the activity
of microorganisms, particularly bacteria, and, as disgusting as it may sound, similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich
environment of your mouth. Don't panic. The presence of bacteria in your body
is not only normal, it's actually vital 
for all sorts of things, like digestion and disease prevention. But like all living things,
bacteria need to eat. The bacteria in your mouth 
feed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells. In order to absorb nutrients
through their cell membranes, they must break down the organic matter
into much smaller molecules. For example, they'll break proteins 
into their component amino acids and then break those down even further
into various compounds. Some of the foul-smelling 
byproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine, escape into the air and waft their way 
towards unsuspecting noses. Our sensitivity to these odors
and interpretation of them as bad smells may be an evolutionary mechanism
warning us of rotten food and the presence of disease. Smell is one of our most intimate
and primal senses, playing a huge role 
in our attraction to potential mates. In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date 
with someone who has bad breath, which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year 
on various breath products. Fortunately, most bad breath 
is easily treated. The worst smelling byproducts come from
gram-negative bacteria that live in the spaces 
between gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue. By brushing and flossing our teeth, using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime, gently cleaning the back of the tongue
with a plastic scraper and even just eating a healthy breakfast, we can remove many of these bacteria
and their food sources. In some cases, 
these measures may not be enough due to dental problems, 
nasal conditions, or rarer ailments, such as liver disease 
and uncontrolled diabetes. Behaviors like smoking 
and excessive alcohol consumption also have a very recognizable odor. Regardless of cause, the bad smell almost 
always originates in the mouth and not the stomach 
or elsewhere in the body. But one of the biggest challenges lies in actually determining 
how our breath smells in the first place, and it's unclear why. It may be that 
we're too acclimatized to the smell inside 
our own mouths to judge it. And methods like cupping your hands
over your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist
don't work perfectly either. One study showed 
that even when people do this, they tend to rate the smell subjectively according to how bad 
they thought it was going to be. But there's one simple,
if socially difficult, way of finding out how your breath smells: just take a deep breath and ask a friend.

is not only normal, it's actually vital 
for all sorts of things, like digestion and disease prevention. But like all living things,
bacteria need to eat. The bacteria in your mouth 
feed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells. In order to absorb nutrients
through their cell membranes, they must break down the organic matter
into much smaller molecules. For example, they'll break proteins 
into their component amino acids and then break those down even further
into various compounds. Some of the foul-smelling 
byproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine, escape into the air and waft their way 
towards unsuspecting noses. Our sensitivity to these odors
and interpretation of them as bad smells may be an evolutionary mechanism
warning us of rotten food and the presence of disease. Smell is one of our most intimate
and primal senses, playing a huge role 
in our attraction to potential mates. In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date 
with someone who has bad breath, which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year 
on various breath products. Fortunately, most bad breath 
is easily treated. The worst smelling byproducts come from
gram-negative bacteria that live in the spaces 
between gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue. By brushing and flossing our teeth, using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime, gently cleaning the back of the tongue
with a plastic scraper and even just eating a healthy breakfast, we can remove many of these bacteria
and their food sources. In some cases, 
these measures may not be enough due to dental problems, 
nasal conditions, or rarer ailments, such as liver disease 
and uncontrolled diabetes. Behaviors like smoking 
and excessive alcohol consumption also have a very recognizable odor. Regardless of cause, the bad smell almost 
always originates in the mouth and not the stomach 
or elsewhere in the body. But one of the biggest challenges lies in actually determining 
how our breath smells in the first place, and it's unclear why. It may be that 
we're too acclimatized to the smell inside 
our own mouths to judge it. And methods like cupping your hands
over your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist
don't work perfectly either. One study showed 
that even when people do this, they tend to rate the smell subjectively according to how bad 
they thought it was going to be. But there's one simple,
if socially difficult, way of finding out how your breath smells: just take a deep breath and ask a friend.

**Transcript**:
It's midnight and all is still, except for the soft skittering 
of a gecko hunting a spider. Geckos seem to defy gravity, scaling vertical surfaces and walking upside down
without claws, adhesive glues or super-powered spiderwebs. Instead, they take advantage 
of a simple principle: that positive 
and negative charges attract. That attraction binds together 
compounds, like table salt, which is made of positively
charged sodium ions stuck to negatively charged chloride ions. But a gecko's feet aren't charged and neither are the surfaces 
they're walking on. So, what makes them stick? The answer lies in a clever combination
of intermolecular forces and stuctural engineering. All the elements in the periodic table
have a different affinity for electrons. Elements like oxygen and fluorine
really, really want electrons, while elements like hydrogen and lithium
don't attract them as strongly. An atom's relative greed for electrons
is called its electronegativity. Electrons are moving around all the time and can easily relocate
to wherever they're wanted most. So when there are atoms with different
electronegativities in the same molecule, the molecules cloud of electrons gets pulled towards 
the more electronegative atom. That creates a thin spot 
in the electron cloud where positive charge 
from the atomic nuclei shines through, as well as a negatively charged 
lump of electrons somewhere else. So the molecule itself isn't charged, but it does have positively 
and negatively charged patches. These patchy charges can attract
neighboring molecules to each other. They'll line up so that 
the positive spots on one are next to the negative 
spots on the other. There doesn't even have to be a strongly
electronegative atom to create these attractive forces. Electrons are always on the move, and sometimes they pile up 
temporarily in one spot. That flicker of charge is enough
to attract molecules to each other. Such interactions between 
uncharged molecules are called van der Waals forces. They're not as strong as the interactions
between charged particles, but if you have enough of them,
they can really add up. That's the gecko's secret. Gecko toes are padded 
with flexible ridges. Those ridges are covered 
in tiny hair-like structures, much thinner than human hair,
called setae. And each of the setae is covered 
in even tinier bristles called spatulae. Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect
for what the gecko needs them to do: stick and release on command. When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes
onto the ceiling, the spatulae hit at the perfect angle
for the van der Waals force to engage. The spatulae flatten, creating lots of surface area 
for their positively and negatively charged patches to find
complimentary patches on the ceiling. Each spatula only contributes a minuscule
amount of that van der Waals stickiness. But a gecko has about two billion of them, creating enough combined force 
to support its weight. In fact, the whole gecko could dangle
from a single one of its toes. That super stickiness 
can be broken, though, by changing the angle just a little bit. So, the gecko can peel its foot back off, scurrying towards a meal
or away from a predator. This strategy, using a forest 
of specially shaped bristles to maximize the van der Waals forces 
between ordinary molecules has inspired man-made materials designed to imitate 
the gecko's amazing adhesive ability. Artificial versions aren't as strong
as gecko toes quite yet, but they're good enough to allow 
a full-grown man to climb 25 feet up a glass wall. In fact, our gecko's prey is also using
van der Waals forces to stick to the ceiling. So, the gecko peels up its toes
and the chase is back on.

**Transcript**:
It's midnight and all is still, except for the soft skittering 
of a gecko hunting a spider. Geckos seem to defy gravity, scaling vertical surfaces and walking upside down
without claws, adhesive glues or super-powered spiderwebs. Instead, they take advantage 
of a simple principle: that positive 
and negative charges attract. That attraction binds together 
compounds, like table salt, which is made of positively
charged sodium ions stuck to negatively charged chloride ions. But a gecko's feet aren't charged and neither are the surfaces 
they're walking on. So, what makes them stick? The answer lies in a clever combination
of intermolecular forces and stuctural engineering. All the elements in the periodic table
have a different affinity for electrons. Elements like oxygen and fluorine
really, really want electrons, while elements like hydrogen and lithium
don't attract them as strongly. An atom's relative greed for electrons
is called its electronegativity. Electrons are moving around all the time and can easily relocate
to wherever they're wanted most. So when there are atoms with different
electronegativities in the same molecule, the molecules cloud of electrons gets pulled towards 
the more electronegative atom. That creates a thin spot 
in the electron cloud where positive charge 
from the atomic nuclei shines through, as well as a negatively charged 
lump of electrons somewhere else. So the molecule itself isn't charged, but it does have positively 
and negatively charged patches. These patchy charges can attract
neighboring molecules to each other. They'll line up so that 
the positive spots on one are next to the negative 
spots on the other. There doesn't even have to be a strongly
electronegative atom to create these attractive forces. Electrons are always on the move, and sometimes they pile up 
temporarily in one spot. That flicker of charge is enough
to attract molecules to each other. Such interactions between 
uncharged molecules are called van der Waals forces. They're not as strong as the interactions
between charged particles, but if you have enough of them,
they can really add up. That's the gecko's secret. Gecko toes are padded 
with flexible ridges. Those ridges are covered 
in tiny hair-like structures, much thinner than human hair,
called setae. And each of the setae is covered 
in even tinier bristles called spatulae. Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect
for what the gecko needs them to do: stick and release on command. When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes
onto the ceiling, the spatulae hit at the perfect angle
for the van der Waals force to engage. The spatulae flatten, creating lots of surface area 
for their positively and negatively charged patches to find
complimentary patches on the ceiling. Each spatula only contributes a minuscule
amount of that van der Waals stickiness. But a gecko has about two billion of them, creating enough combined force 
to support its weight. In fact, the whole gecko could dangle
from a single one of its toes. That super stickiness 
can be broken, though, by changing the angle just a little bit. So, the gecko can peel its foot back off, scurrying towards a meal
or away from a predator. This strategy, using a forest 
of specially shaped bristles to maximize the van der Waals forces 
between ordinary molecules has inspired man-made materials designed to imitate 
the gecko's amazing adhesive ability. Artificial versions aren't as strong
as gecko toes quite yet, but they're good enough to allow 
a full-grown man to climb 25 feet up a glass wall. In fact, our gecko's prey is also using
van der Waals forces to stick to the ceiling. So, the gecko peels up its toes
and the chase is back on.

**Transcript**:
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,
we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating
with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities
of those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing
this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings
and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life. I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you
a real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor. The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres
are completely separate. Because they process
information differently, each of our hemispheres
think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like
and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere
thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine." So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience. And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps
my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite
planes of reality. Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated
from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come
to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right
of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift
this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years
to completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power
of the universe, with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds. And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become
a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project
into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,
we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating
with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities
of those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing
this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings
and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life. I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you
a real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor. The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres
are completely separate. Because they process
information differently, each of our hemispheres
think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like
and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere
thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine." So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience. And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps
my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite
planes of reality. Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated
from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come
to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right
of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift
this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years
to completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power
of the universe, with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds. And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become
a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project
into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps
my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite
planes of reality. Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated
from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come
to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right
of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift
this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years
to completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power
of the universe, with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds. And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become
a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project
into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,
we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating
with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities
of those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing
this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings
and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life. I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you
a real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor. The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres
are completely separate. Because they process
information differently, each of our hemispheres
think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like
and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere
thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine." So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience. And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain

**Transcript**:
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,
we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating
with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities
of those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing
this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings
and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life. I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you
a real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor. The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres
are completely separate. Because they process
information differently, each of our hemispheres
think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like
and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere
thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine." So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience. And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps
my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite
planes of reality. Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated
from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come
to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right
of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift
this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years
to completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power
of the universe, with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds. And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become
a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project
into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

or understand language until I tried so he recognizes that I need help and he and he gets me help and a little while later I'm I'm riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air of just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender and in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive when I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace and then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives and it motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my momma who's a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover so who are we we are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the life-force power of the universe I am the life-force power the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form and one with all that is or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate from you I am dr. Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist these are the wee inside of me which would you choose which do you choose and when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be and I thought that was an idea worth spreading [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia and as a sister and later as a scientist I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams I can connect them to my reality and I can make my dreams come true what is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion so I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of dr. Francine Venice in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry and in the lab we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder so we were essentially mapping the micro circuitry of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals so there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for Nami the National Alliance on Mental Illness but on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a woman's body if you've ever seen a human brain it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another and I have brought for you a real human brain thank you sir so this is a real human brain this is the front of the brain the back of the brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head and when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers but other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate because they process information differently each of our hemisphere think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities excuse me thank you it's been a joy our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment it's all about right here right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place and in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different place our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details details and more details about those details it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities and our left hemisphere thinks in language it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me in my internal world to my external world it's that little voice that says to me hey you got to remember to pick up a Nana's on your way home I need them in the morning it's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it's a little voice that says to me I am I am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you and this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought okay I'll just start my normal routine so I got up and I jumped onto my cardia glider which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar and I thought that's very peculiar and I looked down at my body and I thought whoa I'm a weird-looking thing and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience there was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so I get off the machine and I'm walking across my living room floor and I realized that everything inside of my body has slowed way down and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there's no fluidity to my pace and there's this constriction in my area of perception so I'm just focused on internal systems and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying okay you muscles you got a contract and you muscles you relaxed and now I lost my balance propped up against the the wall and I look down at my arm and I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I can't define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall and all I could detect was this energy energy and I'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain shattered my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button total silence and at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there and then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we had a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help but I'm going oh I got a problem I got a problem so it's like okay okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and I fictionally refer to this space as lala land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to mice my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and I felt this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage oh I felt euphoria euphoria it was beautiful there and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and I'm thinking I've got to get help I gotta focus so I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment and I'm thinking I got to get to work I got to get to work can I Drive can I Drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side did I realize oh my gosh am I having a stroke I'm having a stroke and then the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out and then it crosses my mind but I'm a very busy woman time for a strong it's like okay I can't stop the stroke from happening so I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routine okay so I got a call help I got a call work I couldn't remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on him so I go into my business room I pull out a three inch stack of business cards and I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like I couldn't tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell and then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity and in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card that's not the card that's not the card it took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the mean time for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand a telephone but it's the only plan I have so I take the foam pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam pad but then I would drift back out into lala land and not remember if when I come back and if I'd already dialed those numbers so I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality I'd be able to tell yes I've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the song and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me whoa and I think that myself oh my gosh he sounds like a golden retriever and so I say to him clear in my mind I say to him this is Jill I need help and what comes out of my voice is I think oh my gosh I sound like a golden retriever so I couldn't know I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried so he recognizes that I need help and he and he gets me help and a little while later I'm I'm riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air of just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender and in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive when I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can

motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my momma who's a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover so who are we we are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the

because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall and all I could detect was this energy energy and I'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain shattered my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button total silence and at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there and then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we had a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help but I'm going oh I got a problem I got a problem so it's like okay okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and I fictionally refer to this space as lala land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to mice my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and I felt this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage oh I felt euphoria euphoria it was beautiful there and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and I'm thinking I've got to get help I gotta focus so I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment and I'm thinking I got to get to work I got to get to work can I Drive can I Drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side did I realize oh my gosh am I having a stroke I'm having a stroke and then the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out and then it crosses my mind but I'm a very busy woman time for a strong it's like okay I can't stop the stroke from happening so I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routine okay so I got a call help I got a call work I couldn't remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on him so I go into my business room I pull out a three inch stack of business cards and I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like I couldn't tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell and then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity and in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card that's not the card that's not the card it took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the mean time for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand a telephone but it's the only plan I have so I take the foam pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam pad but then I would drift back out into lala land and not remember if when I come back and if I'd already dialed those numbers so I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality I'd be able to tell yes I've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the song and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me whoa and I think that myself oh my gosh he sounds like a golden retriever and so I say to him clear in my mind I say to him this is Jill I need help and what comes out of my voice is I think oh my gosh I sound like a golden retriever so I couldn't know I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried so he recognizes that I need help and he and he gets me help and a little while later I'm I'm riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air of just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender and in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive when I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace and then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives and it motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my momma who's a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover so who are we we are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the life-force power of the universe I am the life-force power the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form and one with all that is or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate from you I am dr. Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist these are the wee inside of me which would you choose which do you choose and when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be and I thought that was an idea worth spreading [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia and as a sister and later as a scientist I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams I can connect them to my reality and I can make my dreams come true what is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion so I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of dr. Francine Venice in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry and in the lab we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder so we were essentially mapping the micro circuitry of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals so there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for Nami the National Alliance on Mental Illness but on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a woman's body if you've ever seen a human brain it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another and I have brought for you a real human brain thank you sir so this is a real human brain this is the front of the brain the back of the brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head and when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers but other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate because they process information differently each of our hemisphere think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities excuse me thank you it's been a joy our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment it's all about right here right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place and in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different place our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details details and more details about those details it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities and our left hemisphere thinks in language it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me in my internal world to my external world it's that little voice that says to me hey you got to remember to pick up a Nana's on your way home I need them in the morning it's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it's a little voice that says to me I am I am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you and this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought okay I'll just start my normal routine so I got up and I jumped onto my cardia glider which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar and I thought that's very peculiar and I looked down at my body and I thought whoa I'm a weird-looking thing and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience there was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so I get off the machine and I'm walking across my living room floor and I realized that everything inside of my body has slowed way down and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there's no fluidity to my pace and there's this constriction in my area of perception so I'm just focused on internal systems and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying okay you muscles you got a contract and you muscles you relaxed and now I lost my balance propped up against the the wall and I look down at my arm and I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I can't define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall and all I could detect was this energy energy and I'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain shattered my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button total silence and at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there and then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we had a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help but I'm going oh I got a problem I got a problem so it's like okay okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and I fictionally refer to this space as lala land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to mice my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and I felt this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage oh I felt euphoria euphoria it was beautiful there and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and I'm thinking I've got to get help I gotta focus so I get out of the shower and I

are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals so there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for Nami the National Alliance on Mental Illness but on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a woman's body if you've ever seen a human brain it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another and I have brought for you a real human brain thank you sir so this is a real human brain this is the front of the brain the back of the brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head and when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers but other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate because they process information differently each of our hemisphere think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities excuse me thank you it's been a joy our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment it's all about right here right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place and in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different place our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details details and more details about those details it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities and our left hemisphere thinks in language it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me in my internal world to my external world it's that little voice that says to me hey you got to remember to pick up a Nana's on your way home I need them in the morning it's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it's a little voice that says to me I am I am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you and this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought okay I'll just start my normal routine so I got up and I jumped onto my cardia glider which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar and I thought that's very peculiar and I looked down at my body and I thought whoa I'm a weird-looking thing and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience there was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so I get off the machine and I'm walking across my living room floor and I realized that everything inside of my body has slowed way down and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there's no fluidity to my pace and there's this constriction in my area of perception so I'm just focused on internal systems and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying okay you muscles you got a contract and you muscles you relaxed and now I lost my balance propped up against the the wall and I look down at my arm and I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I can't define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall and all I could detect was this energy energy and I'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain shattered my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button total silence and at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there and then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we had a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help but I'm going oh I got a problem I got a problem so it's like okay okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and I fictionally refer to this space as lala land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to mice my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and I felt this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage oh I felt euphoria euphoria it was beautiful there and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and I'm thinking I've got to get help I gotta focus so I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment and I'm thinking I got to get to work I got to get to work can I Drive can I Drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side did I realize oh my gosh am I having a stroke I'm having a stroke and then the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out and then it crosses my mind but I'm a very busy woman time for a strong it's like okay I can't stop the stroke from happening so I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routine okay so I got a call help I got a call work I couldn't remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on him so I go into my business room I pull out a three inch stack of business cards and I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like I couldn't tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell and then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity and in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card that's not the card that's not the card it took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the mean time for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand a telephone but it's the only plan I have so I take the foam pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam pad but then I would drift back out into lala land and not remember if when I come back and if I'd already dialed those numbers so I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality I'd be able to tell yes I've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the song and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me whoa and I think that myself oh my gosh he sounds like a golden retriever and so I say to him clear in my mind I say to him this is Jill I need help and what comes out of my voice is I think oh my gosh I sound like a golden retriever so I couldn't know I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried so he recognizes that I need help and he and he gets me help and a little while later I'm I'm riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air of just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender and in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive when I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace and then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives and it motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my momma who's a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover so who are we we are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the life-force power of the universe I am the life-force power the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form and one with all that is or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate from you I am dr. Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist these are the wee inside of me which would you choose which do you choose and when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be and I thought that was an idea worth spreading [Applause]

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is about flamenco guitarist Juan Ramírez, while the generated MCQs are about Vincent van Gogh and art movements.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it asks about a location, I would choose:

**Question 3: Where did Van Gogh move to in 1888 to set up a studio and paint some of his most famous works, such as "Sunflowers" and "The Starry Night"?**

or 

**Question 7: Where did Van Gogh set up a studio and began to paint some of his most famous works, such as "Sunflowers" and "The Bedroom"?**

Both of these questions ask about a location, but they are still unrelated to the ground truth MCQ.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 4: Which progressive President was nicknamed "Trust Buster"? Options: A. William Howard Taft, B. Woodrow Wilson, C. Theodore Roosevelt, D. Franklin D. Roosevelt Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the president's nickname rather than the tool used for "trustbusting". 

A more similar question would be one that asks about the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

But if I had to choose the most similar one based on the content and intent, I would choose:

None of the questions exactly match, but question 4 is the closest in terms of content.

However I must note there isn't a direct match, if the list of generated questions were larger there might be a direct match, but with the current list the best match is question 4 but it is not a direct match

**Transcript**:
When you think of 
Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment, you probably think of this. As it turns out, it may 
have been more like this. In the third century BC, Hieron,
king of the Sicilian city of Syracuse, chose Archimedes to supervise an engineering project 
of unprecedented scale. Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel 50 times bigger than a standard
ancient warship, named the Syracusia after his city. Hieron wanted to construct
the largest ship ever, which was destined 
to be given as a present for Egypt's ruler, Ptolemy. But could a boat the size
of a palace possibly float? In Archimedes's day, 
no one had attempted anything like this. It was like asking, "Can a mountain fly?" King Hieron had a lot 
riding on that question. Hundreds of workmen were to labor
for years on constructing the Syracusia out of beams of pine 
and fir from Mount Etna, ropes from hemp grown in Spain, and pitch from France. The top deck, on which 
eight watchtowers were to stand, was to be supported not by columns, but by vast wooden images of Atlas
holding the world on his shoulders. On the ship's bow, a massive catapult would be able 
to fire 180 pound stone missiles. For the enjoyment of its passengers, the ship was to feature 
a flower-lined promenade, a sheltered swimming pool, and bathhouse with heated water, a library filled with books and statues, a temple to the goddess Aphrodite, and a gymnasium. And just to make things 
more difficult for Archimedes, Hieron intended to pack 
the vessel full of cargo: 400 tons of grain, 10,000 jars of pickled fish, 74 tons of drinking water, and 600 tons of wool. It would have carried well over
a thousand people on board, including 600 soldiers. And it housed 20 horses 
in separate stalls. To build something of this scale, only for that to sink 
on its maiden voyage? Well, let's just say that failure wouldn't have been a pleasant 
option for Archimedes. So he took on the problem: will it sink? Perhaps he was sitting 
in the bathhouse one day, wondering how a heavy bathtub can float, when inspiration came to him. An object partially immersed in a fluid
is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid
displaced by the object. In other words, if a 2,000 ton Syracusia
displaced exactly 2,000 tons of water, it would just barely float. If it displaced 4,000 tons of water,
it would float with no problem. Of course, if it only displaced 
1,000 tons of water, well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy. This is the law of buoyancy, and engineers still 
call it Archimedes' Principle. It explains why a steel supertanker
can float as easily as a wooden rowboat or a bathtub. If the weight of water displaced
by the vessel below the keel is equivalent to the vessel's weight, whatever is above the keel
will remain afloat above the waterline. This sounds a lot like another story
involving Archimedes and a bathtub, and it's possible that's because
they're actually the same story, twisted by the vagaries of history. The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka!
and subsequent streak through the streets centers around a crown, 
or corona in Latin. At the core of the Syracusia story
is a keel, or korone in Greek. Could one have been 
mixed up for the other? We may never know. On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt
on its first and only voyage, we can only imagine how residents
of Alexandria thronged the harbor to marvel at the arrival 
of this majestic, floating castle. This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic
of the ancient world, except without the sinking,
thanks to our pal, Archimedes.

Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment, you probably think of this. As it turns out, it may 
have been more like this. In the third century BC, Hieron,
king of the Sicilian city of Syracuse, chose Archimedes to supervise an engineering project 
of unprecedented scale. Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel 50 times bigger than a standard
ancient warship, named the Syracusia after his city. Hieron wanted to construct
the largest ship ever, which was destined 
to be given as a present for Egypt's ruler, Ptolemy. But could a boat the size
of a palace possibly float? In Archimedes's day, 
no one had attempted anything like this. It was like asking, "Can a mountain fly?" King Hieron had a lot 
riding on that question. Hundreds of workmen were to labor
for years on constructing the Syracusia out of beams of pine 
and fir from Mount Etna, ropes from hemp grown in Spain, and pitch from France. The top deck, on which 
eight watchtowers were to stand, was to be supported not by columns, but by vast wooden images of Atlas
holding the world on his shoulders. On the ship's bow, a massive catapult would be able 
to fire 180 pound stone missiles. For the enjoyment of its passengers, the ship was to feature 
a flower-lined promenade, a sheltered swimming pool, and bathhouse with heated water, a library filled with books and statues, a temple to the goddess Aphrodite, and a gymnasium. And just to make things 
more difficult for Archimedes, Hieron intended to pack 
the vessel full of cargo: 400 tons of grain, 10,000 jars of pickled fish, 74 tons of drinking water, and 600 tons of wool. It would have carried well over
a thousand people on board, including 600 soldiers. And it housed 20 horses 
in separate stalls. To build something of this scale, only for that to sink 
on its maiden voyage? Well, let's just say that failure wouldn't have been a pleasant 
option for Archimedes. So he took on the problem: will it sink? Perhaps he was sitting 
in the bathhouse one day, wondering how a heavy bathtub can float, when inspiration came to him. An object partially immersed in a fluid
is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid
displaced by the object. In other words, if a 2,000 ton Syracusia
displaced exactly 2,000 tons of water, it would just barely float. If it displaced 4,000 tons of water,
it would float with no problem. Of course, if it only displaced 
1,000 tons of water, well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy. This is the law of buoyancy, and engineers still 
call it Archimedes' Principle. It explains why a steel supertanker
can float as easily as a wooden rowboat or a bathtub. If the weight of water displaced
by the vessel below the keel is equivalent to the vessel's weight, whatever is above the keel
will remain afloat above the waterline. This sounds a lot like another story
involving Archimedes and a bathtub, and it's possible that's because
they're actually the same story, twisted by the vagaries of history. The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka!
and subsequent streak through the streets centers around a crown, 
or corona in Latin. At the core of the Syracusia story
is a keel, or korone in Greek. Could one have been 
mixed up for the other? We may never know. On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt
on its first and only voyage, we can only imagine how residents
of Alexandria thronged the harbor to marvel at the arrival 
of this majestic, floating castle. This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic
of the ancient world, except without the sinking,
thanks to our pal, Archimedes.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the temple on Archimedes' ship being dedicated to a specific goddess. While there isn't a direct match, Question 4 mentions the purpose of the Syracusia's visit to Egypt, which is related to the ship's features, including the temple.

However, a more relevant question would be one that asks about the features or components of the Syracusia. Among the generated MCQs, Question 1 asks about the name of the sailing vessel, and Question 2 asks about King Hieron's primary concern regarding the Syracusia's construction.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 4, but with a low confidence level.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (with low confidence)

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require a new question that specifically asks about the temple or the goddess it is dedicated to.

**Transcript**:
For most of human history, medical workers sought 
to treat diseases or cure them. The rise of vaccination 
in the 19th century enhanced the potential to prevent people from contracting illnesses
in the first place. But only in recent decades did it 
become possible to ensure that a particular disease
never threatens humanity again. The story of smallpox, the first and, so far, the only disease to be permanently 
eradicated from the world, shows how disease eradication can happen
and why it is so difficult to achieve. Smallpox emerged in human populations
thousands of years ago as a contagious virus that spread rapidly, primarily through close, 
face to face contact, causing fever, aches and rashes. It killed up to 30% of its victims and often left survivors with life-long
disfiguring scars. The devastating impact 
of smallpox was so great that several cultures had religious 
deities specifically dedicated to it. In the 20th century alone, it is estimated to have killed
more than 300 million people worldwide. With the effective 
deployment of vaccination, the number of cases began to decrease. By seeking out infected individuals, isolating them, and vaccinating their contacts 
to prevent further transmission, scientists realized that the spread
of the disease could be haulted. In fact, because smallpox could
only survive in human hosts, vaccinating all of an infected persons'
potential contacts would stop the virus dead in its tracks and eliminate it from that region. Once this strategy had succeeded in ridding most industrialized countries
from disease, health officials realized that eradicating
it worldwide was within reach. But this was not an easy process, proving especially difficult in places
suffering from poor infrastructure or civil wars. The eradication effort took decades and involved millions 
of people working together, from world leaders
and international organizations to rural doctors and community workers. In India, one of the last 
strongholds of the disease, health workers visited every one
of the country's 100 million households to search for cases. Through this unprecedented 
worldwide effort, in which even rival 
superpowers cooperated, smallpox was finally 
declared eradicated in 1980, saving approximately 40 million lives
over the following two decades. There were several factors that made smallpox
an ideal candidate for eradication. First, humans are essential
to the smallpox lifecycle, so breaking the chain 
of human to human transmission causes the virus to die out. In contrast, many other pathogens,
like ebola or the bubonic plague, can survive in animal carriers, while the bacteria that cause tetanus
can even live in the soil. Secondly, individuals 
infected with smallpox displayed a characteristic rash,
making them easy to identify, even without a lab test. The lack of such practical 
diagnostic tools for diseases with non-specific symptoms,
or that have long incubation periods, such as AIDS,
makes their eradication more difficult. Third, the availability 
of a smallpox vaccine that provided immunity 
for five to ten years in a single dose meant that there was 
an effective intervention to stop the virus from spreading. And finally, the initial success
of several countries in eliminating the disease 
within their borders served as a proof of principle
for its eradication worldwide. Today, the same criteria 
are applied to determine whether other diseases 
can be similarly eliminated. And even though smallpox remains
the only success story thus far, several other pathogens 
may be next in line. Great progress has been made
towards eradicating guinea worm disease simply by use of water filters. And vaccination for polio, which previously disabled hundreds
of thousands of people each year is estimated to have prevented 13 million
cases of paralysis, and 650,000 deaths since 1988. With a 99% drop in infections
since the eradication effort began, one final push is all that is needed to ensure that polio 
will never paralyze another child. Disease eradication is one public health
effort that benefits all of humanity and challenges us to work together
as a global community. Beyond eliminating specific diseases, eradication programs benefit 
local populations by improving health infrastructure. For example, Nigeria recently 
used facilities and personnel from their polio eradication program
to effectively control an ebola outbreak. Further more, globalization 
and international travel means that even a single infection
anywhere in the world can potentially spread to other regions. By helping to protect others,
we help to protect ourselves. Disease eradication is the ultimate gift
we can give to everyone alive today, as well as all future 
generations of humanity.

**Transcript**:
For most of human history, medical workers sought 
to treat diseases or cure them. The rise of vaccination 
in the 19th century enhanced the potential to prevent people from contracting illnesses
in the first place. But only in recent decades did it 
become possible to ensure that a particular disease
never threatens humanity again. The story of smallpox, the first and, so far, the only disease to be permanently 
eradicated from the world, shows how disease eradication can happen
and why it is so difficult to achieve. Smallpox emerged in human populations
thousands of years ago as a contagious virus that spread rapidly, primarily through close, 
face to face contact, causing fever, aches and rashes. It killed up to 30% of its victims and often left survivors with life-long
disfiguring scars. The devastating impact 
of smallpox was so great that several cultures had religious 
deities specifically dedicated to it. In the 20th century alone, it is estimated to have killed
more than 300 million people worldwide. With the effective 
deployment of vaccination, the number of cases began to decrease. By seeking out infected individuals, isolating them, and vaccinating their contacts 
to prevent further transmission, scientists realized that the spread
of the disease could be haulted. In fact, because smallpox could

for five to ten years in a single dose meant that there was 
an effective intervention to stop the virus from spreading. And finally, the initial success
of several countries in eliminating the disease 
within their borders served as a proof of principle
for its eradication worldwide. Today, the same criteria 
are applied to determine whether other diseases 
can be similarly eliminated. And even though smallpox remains
the only success story thus far, several other pathogens 
may be next in line. Great progress has been made
towards eradicating guinea worm disease simply by use of water filters. And vaccination for polio, which previously disabled hundreds
of thousands of people each year is estimated to have prevented 13 million
cases of paralysis, and 650,000 deaths since 1988. With a 99% drop in infections
since the eradication effort began, one final push is all that is needed to ensure that polio 
will never paralyze another child. Disease eradication is one public health
effort that benefits all of humanity and challenges us to work together
as a global community. Beyond eliminating specific diseases, eradication programs benefit 
local populations by improving health infrastructure. For example, Nigeria recently 
used facilities and personnel from their polio eradication program
to effectively control an ebola outbreak. Further more, globalization 
and international travel means that even a single infection
anywhere in the world can potentially spread to other regions. By helping to protect others,
we help to protect ourselves. Disease eradication is the ultimate gift
we can give to everyone alive today, as well as all future 
generations of humanity.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the cajon, a musical instrument, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to smallpox and its characteristics that made it an ideal candidate for eradication.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 9 is the closest match. This question asks about the story of the cajon being an example of something, and the options provide different possible answers. Similarly, the ground truth MCQ asks about the characteristic that made smallpox an ideal candidate for eradication, and the options provide different possible answers.

But again, I want to emphasize that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
Which of these entities 
has evolved the ability to manipulate an animal
many times its size? The answer is all of them. These are all parasites, organisms that live on 
or inside another host organism, which they harm and sometimes even kill. Parasite survival depends on transmitting
from one host to the next, sometimes through 
an intermediate species. Our parasites elegantly achieve this
by manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,
but the cricket prefers dry land. So once it's big enough to reproduce, the worm produces proteins that garble
the cricket's navigational system. The confused cricket 
jumps around erratically, moves closer to water, and eventually leaps in,
often drowning in the process. The worm then wriggles out to mate and its eggs get eaten 
by little water insects that mature, colonize land, and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets. And thus, the Gordian worm lives on. And here's the rabies virus,
another mind-altering parasite. This virus infects mammals, often dogs, and travels up the animal's 
nerves to its brain where it causes inflammation 
that eventually kills the host. But before it does, it often increases
its host's aggressiveness and ramps up the production
of rabies-transmitting saliva, while making it hard to swallow. These factors make the host 
more likely to bite another animal and more likely to pass 
the virus on when it does. And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,
also known as the zombie fungus. Its host of choice is tropical ants
that normally live in treetops. After Ophiocordyceps spores 
pierce the ant's exoskeleton, they set off convulsions 
that make the ant fall from the tree. The fungus changes the ant's behavior,
compelling it to wander mindlessly until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with
the perfect fungal breeding conditions, which it latches onto. The ant then dies, and the fungus parasitizes its body
to build a tall, thin stalk from its neck. Within several weeks, 
the stalk shoots off spores, which turn more ants 
into six-legged leaf-seeking zombies. One of humanity's most deadly assailants
is a behavior-altering parasite, though if it's any consolation, it's not our brains 
that are being hijacked. I'm talking about Plasmodium,
which causes malaria. This parasite needs mosquitoes
to shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently
and for longer. There's also evidence 
that humans infected with malaria are more attractive to mosquitoes, which will bite them 
and transfer the parasite further. This multi-species system is so effective, that there are hundreds of millions
of malaria cases every year. And finally, there are cats. Don't worry, there probably 
aren't any cats living in your body and controlling your thoughts. I mean, probably. But there is a microorganism
called Toxoplasma that needs both cats and rodents
to complete its life cycle. When a rat gets infected
by eating cat feces, the parasite changes chemical levels
in the rat's brain, making it less cautious
around the hungry felines, maybe even attracted to them. This makes them easy prey, so these infected rodents
get eaten and pass the parasite on. Mind control successful. There's even evidence that the parasite
affects human behavior. In most cases, 
we don't completely understand how these parasites manage 
their feats of behavior modification. But from what we do know, we can tell that they have 
a pretty diverse toolbox. Gordian worms seem to affect
crickets' brains directly. The malaria parasite, on the other hand, blocks an enzyme 
that helps the mosquitoes feed, forcing them to bite over 
and over and over again. The rabies virus may cause 
that snarling, slobbering behavior by putting the immune system
into overdrive. But whatever the method, when you think about how effectively these parasites control 
the behavior of their hosts, you may wonder how much of human behavior
is actually parasites doing the talking. Since more than half of the species
on Earth are parasites, it could be more than we think.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the type of host manipulation that may be expected to see in tsetse flies transmitting the protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans. The correct option is "Infected flies will bite humans more often and for a longer time."

Considering the generated MCQs, I found that Question 4 in the provided set is not relevant. However, I noticed that the transcript mentions a similar concept: "This parasite needs mosquitoes to shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently and for longer." 

Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related, I would say Question 8 is the closest in terms of discussing organisms and their behavior, but it is still not a good match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say "None" or "Not Available" is the most accurate response. However, if you insist on an index, I can provide the index of the question that is somewhat related, which is Question 8.

**Transcript**:
Which of these entities 
has evolved the ability to manipulate an animal
many times its size? The answer is all of them. These are all parasites, organisms that live on 
or inside another host organism, which they harm and sometimes even kill. Parasite survival depends on transmitting
from one host to the next, sometimes through 
an intermediate species. Our parasites elegantly achieve this
by manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,
but the cricket prefers dry land. So once it's big enough to reproduce, the worm produces proteins that garble
the cricket's navigational system. The confused cricket 
jumps around erratically, moves closer to water, and eventually leaps in,
often drowning in the process. The worm then wriggles out to mate and its eggs get eaten 
by little water insects that mature, colonize land, and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets. And thus, the Gordian worm lives on. And here's the rabies virus,
another mind-altering parasite. This virus infects mammals, often dogs, and travels up the animal's 
nerves to its brain where it causes inflammation 
that eventually kills the host. But before it does, it often increases
its host's aggressiveness and ramps up the production
of rabies-transmitting saliva, while making it hard to swallow. These factors make the host 
more likely to bite another animal and more likely to pass 
the virus on when it does. And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,
also known as the zombie fungus. Its host of choice is tropical ants
that normally live in treetops. After Ophiocordyceps spores 
pierce the ant's exoskeleton, they set off convulsions 
that make the ant fall from the tree. The fungus changes the ant's behavior,
compelling it to wander mindlessly until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with
the perfect fungal breeding conditions, which it latches onto. The ant then dies, and the fungus parasitizes its body
to build a tall, thin stalk from its neck. Within several weeks, 
the stalk shoots off spores, which turn more ants 
into six-legged leaf-seeking zombies. One of humanity's most deadly assailants
is a behavior-altering parasite, though if it's any consolation, it's not our brains 
that are being hijacked. I'm talking about Plasmodium,
which causes malaria. This parasite needs mosquitoes
to shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently
and for longer. There's also evidence 
that humans infected with malaria are more attractive to mosquitoes, which will bite them 
and transfer the parasite further. This multi-species system is so effective, that there are hundreds of millions
of malaria cases every year. And finally, there are cats. Don't worry, there probably 
aren't any cats living in your body and controlling your thoughts. I mean, probably. But there is a microorganism
called Toxoplasma that needs both cats and rodents
to complete its life cycle. When a rat gets infected
by eating cat feces, the parasite changes chemical levels
in the rat's brain, making it less cautious
around the hungry felines, maybe even attracted to them. This makes them easy prey, so these infected rodents
get eaten and pass the parasite on. Mind control successful. There's even evidence that the parasite
affects human behavior. In most cases, 
we don't completely understand how these parasites manage 
their feats of behavior modification. But from what we do know, we can tell that they have 
a pretty diverse toolbox. Gordian worms seem to affect
crickets' brains directly. The malaria parasite, on the other hand, blocks an enzyme 
that helps the mosquitoes feed, forcing them to bite over 
and over and over again. The rabies virus may cause 
that snarling, slobbering behavior by putting the immune system
into overdrive. But whatever the method, when you think about how effectively these parasites control 
the behavior of their hosts, you may wonder how much of human behavior
is actually parasites doing the talking. Since more than half of the species
on Earth are parasites, it could be more than we think.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not match the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is about parasites. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as cell biology and the endosymbiotic theory.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them are similar enough to be considered a match. But if I had to pick one, I would say that Question 7 is the closest in terms of question style and format, but it is still not similar in terms of content and intent.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None (or 7, if I had to pick one, but with a note that it's not a good match).

It would be best to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of parasites and match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, options, and overall intent.

are cumbersome or have a lot of parts. Some need a stand or a stool. But the cajon is a drum, a stand
and a seat all in one convenient box. And this simplicity may be key to its
journey across continents and cultures to become one of the most popular 
percussion instruments in the world today. The cajon's story begins in West Africa, whose Indigenousness people
had rich musical traditions centered on drumming and dancing. When many of them were captured
and brought to the Americas as slaves, they brought this culture with them, but without their native instruments,
they had to improvise. African slaves in coastal Peru
didn't have the materials or the opportunity to craft 
one of their traditional drums such as a djembe or a djun djun. But what they did have 
were plenty of shipping crates. Not only were these readily accessible, but their inconspicuous appearance may have helped get around laws 
prohibiting slaves from playing music. Early Peruvian cajons 
consisted of a simple box with five thick wooden sides. The sixth side, made of 
a thinner sheet of wood, would be used as the striking surface, or more commonly known as the tapa. A sound hole was also cut into the back
to allow the sound to escape. As an Afro-Peruvian culture developed, and new forms of music and dance,
such as Zamacueca, Festejo and Landó were born, the cajon became a dedicated musical
instrument in its own right. Early modifications involved simply
bending the planks of the box to tweak the sound, and when abolition of slavery introduced
the cajon to a broader population, more improvisation 
and experimentation soon followed. Perhaps the person most responsible 
for introducing the cajon to European audiences was Spanish 
Flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía. When touring in Peru in 1977, he and his percussionist Rubem Dantas discovered the cajon 
and brought it back to Spain, recognizing its potential 
for use in Flamenco music. By stretching guitar strings 
along the inside of the tapa, the flamenco musicians were able to create
a buzz-like snare sound. Combined with the regular base tone, this gave the cajon a sound 
close to a basic drum set. The cajon quickly caught on, not only becoming standard in Flamenco, but being used in genres like folk,
jazz, blues, and rock. Today, many specialized cajons 
are manufactured, some with adjustable strings, some with multiple playing surfaces, and some with a snare mechansim. But the basic concept remains the same, and the story of the cajon shows that the simplest things 
can have the most amazing potential when you think outside and inside the box.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to provide an index, I would say -1 or "No match" would be a more accurate response.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
What if you could absorb
another organism and take on its abilities? Imagine you swallowed a small bird
and suddenly gained the ability to fly. Or if you engulfed a cobra and were then able to spit poisonous venom
from your teeth. Throughout the history of life, specifically during the evolution 
of complex eukaryotic cells, things like this happened all the time. One organism absorbed another, and they united to become a new organism
with the combined abilities of both. We think that around 2 billion years ago, the only living organisms on Earth
were prokaryotes, single-celled organisms 
lacking membrane-bound organelles. Let's look closely at just three of them. One was a big, simple blob-like cell with the ability to absorb things 
by wrapping its cell membrane around them. Another was a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar
molecules through photosynthesis. A third used oxygen gas to break down
materials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful
for life activities. The blob cells would occasionally absorb
the little photosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria then lived inside the blob
and divided like they always had, but their existence became linked. If you stumbled upon 
this living arrangement, you might just think that the whole thing
was one organism, that the green photosynthetic bacteria
were just a part of the blob that performed one of its life functions, just like your heart is a part of you that performs the function 
of pumping your blood. This process of cells living together
is called endosymbiosis, one organism living inside another. But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there. What would happen
if the other bacteria moved in, too? Now the cells of this species started
becoming highly complex. They were big and full 
of intricate structures that we call chloroplasts 
and mitochondria. These structures work together 
to harness sunlight, make sugar, and break down that sugar using the oxygen that right around this time started 
to appear in the Earth's atmosphere. Organisms absorbing other organisms was one way species adapted
to the changing environmental conditions of their surroundings. This little story highlights what 
biologists call the endosymbiotic theory, the current best explanation
of how complex cells evolved. There's a lot of evidence 
that supports this theory, but let's look at three main pieces. First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria
in our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, which are still around, by the way. In fact, if you destroy these structures
in a cell, no new ones will appear. The cell can't make them. They can only make more of themselves. Second piece of evidence. Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain
their own DNA and ribosomes. Their DNA has a circular structure that is strikingly similar to the DNA
of the ancient bacteria, and it also contains many similar genes. The ribosomes, or protein assembly 
machines of chloroplasts and mitochondria, also have the same structure as ribosomes
of ancient bacteria, but are different from the ribosomes hanging around
the rest of eukaryotic cell. Lastly, think about the membranes involved
in the engulfing process. Chloroplasts and mitochondria
both have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. Their inner membrane contains 
some particular lipids and proteins that are not present 
in the outer membrane. Why is that significant? Because their outer membrane
used to belong to the blob cell. When they were engulfed
in the endosymbiosis process, they got wrapped up in that membrane
and kept their own as their inner one. Surely enough, those same lipids and proteins are found on the membranes
of the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast 
variety of eukaryotic organisms. Take the green algae that grow on 
the walls of swimming pools. A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning 
tail structures, or flagella, at some point absorbed algae like these
to form what we now call euglena. Euglena can perform photosynthesis, break down sugar using oxygen, and swim around pond water. And as the theory would predict, the chloroplasts in these euglena
have three membranes since they had two before being engulfed. The absorbing process
of endosymbiotic theory allowed organisms to combine 
powerful abilities to become better adapted to life on Earth. The results were species 
capable of much more than when they were separate organisms, and this was an evolutionary leap that lead to the microorganisms, plants, and animals we observe 
on the planet today.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, specifically left-handedness, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the production of new mitochondria inside eukaryotic cells.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question type and structure, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but only in terms of the question structure, not the content.

But since the content is not similar, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ.

If you provide more generated MCQs that are related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

**Transcript**:
What if you could absorb
another organism and take on its abilities? Imagine you swallowed a small bird
and suddenly gained the ability to fly. Or if you engulfed a cobra and were then able to spit poisonous venom
from your teeth. Throughout the history of life, specifically during the evolution 
of complex eukaryotic cells, things like this happened all the time. One organism absorbed another, and they united to become a new organism
with the combined abilities of both. We think that around 2 billion years ago, the only living organisms on Earth
were prokaryotes, single-celled organisms 
lacking membrane-bound organelles. Let's look closely at just three of them. One was a big, simple blob-like cell with the ability to absorb things 
by wrapping its cell membrane around them. Another was a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar
molecules through photosynthesis. A third used oxygen gas to break down
materials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful
for life activities. The blob cells would occasionally absorb
the little photosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria then lived inside the blob
and divided like they always had, but their existence became linked. If you stumbled upon 
this living arrangement, you might just think that the whole thing
was one organism, that the green photosynthetic bacteria
were just a part of the blob that performed one of its life functions, just like your heart is a part of you that performs the function 
of pumping your blood. This process of cells living together
is called endosymbiosis, one organism living inside another. But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there. What would happen
if the other bacteria moved in, too? Now the cells of this species started
becoming highly complex. They were big and full 
of intricate structures that we call chloroplasts 
and mitochondria. These structures work together 
to harness sunlight, make sugar, and break down that sugar using the oxygen that right around this time started 
to appear in the Earth's atmosphere. Organisms absorbing other organisms was one way species adapted
to the changing environmental conditions of their surroundings. This little story highlights what 
biologists call the endosymbiotic theory, the current best explanation
of how complex cells evolved. There's a lot of evidence 
that supports this theory, but let's look at three main pieces. First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria
in our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, which are still around, by the way. In fact, if you destroy these structures
in a cell, no new ones will appear. The cell can't make them. They can only make more of themselves. Second piece of evidence. Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain
their own DNA and ribosomes. Their DNA has a circular structure that is strikingly similar to the DNA
of the ancient bacteria, and it also contains many similar genes. The ribosomes, or protein assembly 
machines of chloroplasts and mitochondria, also have the same structure as ribosomes
of ancient bacteria, but are different from the ribosomes hanging around
the rest of eukaryotic cell. Lastly, think about the membranes involved
in the engulfing process. Chloroplasts and mitochondria
both have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. Their inner membrane contains 
some particular lipids and proteins that are not present 
in the outer membrane. Why is that significant? Because their outer membrane
used to belong to the blob cell. When they were engulfed
in the endosymbiosis process, they got wrapped up in that membrane
and kept their own as their inner one. Surely enough, those same lipids and proteins are found on the membranes
of the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast 
variety of eukaryotic organisms. Take the green algae that grow on 
the walls of swimming pools. A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning 
tail structures, or flagella, at some point absorbed algae like these
to form what we now call euglena. Euglena can perform photosynthesis, break down sugar using oxygen, and swim around pond water. And as the theory would predict, the chloroplasts in these euglena
have three membranes since they had two before being engulfed. The absorbing process
of endosymbiotic theory allowed organisms to combine 
powerful abilities to become better adapted to life on Earth. The results were species 
capable of much more than when they were separate organisms, and this was an evolutionary leap that lead to the microorganisms, plants, and animals we observe 
on the planet today.

**Transcript**:
Despite advances in medicine, cancer remains one of the most frightening
diagnoses patients can receive. What makes it so difficult to cure
is that it's not one illness, but a family of over 100 diseases
occurring in different types of cells. And one type of cancer 
has the unfortunate distinction of afflicting children 
more than any other type. This is leukemia, a cancer that begins in stem cells
found in the bone marrow. A stem cell is a bit like an infant, undeveloped but possessing 
great potential. Many stem cells specialize
and become cells of organs, like the liver, brain and heart. But in some tissues, they can continue to divide into new 
stem cells throughout development, and into adulthood in order to frequently
generate new cells and keep up with the body's needs. One example is the bone marrow, where stem cells differentiate
into many types of blood cells. That includes red blood cells, which carry oxygen 
from the lungs to all tissues, platelets, which help stop bleeding
by sticking to damaged blood vessels, and white blood cells, which patrol the body,
destroying potentially harmful invaders. Every once in a while, something goes wrong during 
a stem cell's specialization process and harmful mutations 
occur in the cell's DNA. Cells with compromised DNA
are supposed to self-destruct, but some damaged cells ignore this order, replicating uncontrollably,
even as they lose their original function. These are what we know as cancer cells. It is not yet clear why leukemia
is the most common childhood cancer, but one contributing factor may be that leukemias are often caused
by just one or two DNA modifications, while most cancers require many of them, allowing leukemias to arise faster
than other types of cancer. Moreover, some DNA alterations
can occur in white blood cells during fetal development, further increasing the risk 
of early leukemia. But though it affects more children
than any other cancer, adults constitute the majority
of leukemia patients overall. Once leukemia strikes, the damaged cells
reproduce in the blood and the bone marrow until they take up 
all available space and resources. When the bone marrow 
can no longer produce the required amount of functional cells, the blood becomes depleted. The lack of red blood cells means that muscles 
don't get enough oxygen, the reduced number of platelets
is not sufficient to repair wounds, and the dearth of functional white
blood cells impairs the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. To restore the normal 
function of the blood, leukemic cells have to be eliminated. But because leukemias 
are not solid tumors, they can't be removed surgically. Instead, the cells are killed
inside the body using various treatments that include chemotherapy, a combination of drugs that destroys
quickly multiplying cells. Unfortunately, this has the side effect
of killing healthy cells, such as those found in hair follicles
or intestines. And in some cases, the dosage 
required is so high that it kills all cells 
in the bone marrow, including stem cells. When this happens, the body is no longer
able to create new blood cells on its own. Fortunately, outside help can come
in the form of stem cells from the bone marrow of a donor. Once transplanted into the patient, they rapidly repopulate 
the bone marrow and the blood. However, bone marrow transplants
are a complicated process requiring antigen compatibility
between the donor and recipient to keep the transplanted cells from
from attacking the patient's own cells as foreign bodies. Unlike with blood transplants, there are thousands of HLA types, and even siblings and close relatives
may not have compatible bone marrow. If this is the case, the search 
is expanded to a database containing the genetic makeup of millions
of voluntary bone marrow donors. The more potential donors there are, the more patients lives can be saved
through successful transplants. Leukemia may be a frightening disease,
but there is strength and hope in numbers.

diagnoses patients can receive. What makes it so difficult to cure
is that it's not one illness, but a family of over 100 diseases
occurring in different types of cells. And one type of cancer 
has the unfortunate distinction of afflicting children 
more than any other type. This is leukemia, a cancer that begins in stem cells
found in the bone marrow. A stem cell is a bit like an infant, undeveloped but possessing 
great potential. Many stem cells specialize
and become cells of organs, like the liver, brain and heart. But in some tissues, they can continue to divide into new 
stem cells throughout development, and into adulthood in order to frequently
generate new cells and keep up with the body's needs. One example is the bone marrow, where stem cells differentiate
into many types of blood cells. That includes red blood cells, which carry oxygen 
from the lungs to all tissues, platelets, which help stop bleeding
by sticking to damaged blood vessels, and white blood cells, which patrol the body,
destroying potentially harmful invaders. Every once in a while, something goes wrong during 
a stem cell's specialization process and harmful mutations 
occur in the cell's DNA. Cells with compromised DNA
are supposed to self-destruct, but some damaged cells ignore this order, replicating uncontrollably,
even as they lose their original function. These are what we know as cancer cells. It is not yet clear why leukemia
is the most common childhood cancer, but one contributing factor may be that leukemias are often caused
by just one or two DNA modifications, while most cancers require many of them, allowing leukemias to arise faster
than other types of cancer. Moreover, some DNA alterations
can occur in white blood cells during fetal development, further increasing the risk 
of early leukemia. But though it affects more children
than any other cancer, adults constitute the majority
of leukemia patients overall. Once leukemia strikes, the damaged cells
reproduce in the blood and the bone marrow until they take up 
all available space and resources. When the bone marrow 
can no longer produce the required amount of functional cells, the blood becomes depleted. The lack of red blood cells means that muscles 
don't get enough oxygen, the reduced number of platelets
is not sufficient to repair wounds, and the dearth of functional white
blood cells impairs the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. To restore the normal 
function of the blood, leukemic cells have to be eliminated. But because leukemias 
are not solid tumors, they can't be removed surgically. Instead, the cells are killed
inside the body using various treatments that include chemotherapy, a combination of drugs that destroys
quickly multiplying cells. Unfortunately, this has the side effect
of killing healthy cells, such as those found in hair follicles
or intestines. And in some cases, the dosage 
required is so high that it kills all cells 
in the bone marrow, including stem cells. When this happens, the body is no longer
able to create new blood cells on its own. Fortunately, outside help can come
in the form of stem cells from the bone marrow of a donor. Once transplanted into the patient, they rapidly repopulate 
the bone marrow and the blood. However, bone marrow transplants
are a complicated process requiring antigen compatibility
between the donor and recipient to keep the transplanted cells from
from attacking the patient's own cells as foreign bodies. Unlike with blood transplants, there are thousands of HLA types, and even siblings and close relatives
may not have compatible bone marrow. If this is the case, the search 
is expanded to a database containing the genetic makeup of millions
of voluntary bone marrow donors. The more potential donors there are, the more patients lives can be saved
through successful transplants. Leukemia may be a frightening disease,
but there is strength and hope in numbers.

**Transcript**:
Despite advances in medicine, cancer remains one of the most frightening
diagnoses patients can receive. What makes it so difficult to cure
is that it's not one illness, but a family of over 100 diseases
occurring in different types of cells. And one type of cancer 
has the unfortunate distinction of afflicting children 
more than any other type. This is leukemia, a cancer that begins in stem cells
found in the bone marrow. A stem cell is a bit like an infant, undeveloped but possessing 
great potential. Many stem cells specialize
and become cells of organs, like the liver, brain and heart. But in some tissues, they can continue to divide into new

**Transcript**:
Despite advances in medicine, cancer remains one of the most frightening
diagnoses patients can receive. What makes it so difficult to cure
is that it's not one illness, but a family of over 100 diseases
occurring in different types of cells. And one type of cancer 
has the unfortunate distinction of afflicting children 
more than any other type. This is leukemia, a cancer that begins in stem cells
found in the bone marrow. A stem cell is a bit like an infant, undeveloped but possessing 
great potential. Many stem cells specialize
and become cells of organs, like the liver, brain and heart. But in some tissues, they can continue to divide into new 
stem cells throughout development, and into adulthood in order to frequently
generate new cells and keep up with the body's needs. One example is the bone marrow, where stem cells differentiate
into many types of blood cells. That includes red blood cells, which carry oxygen 
from the lungs to all tissues, platelets, which help stop bleeding
by sticking to damaged blood vessels, and white blood cells, which patrol the body,
destroying potentially harmful invaders. Every once in a while, something goes wrong during 
a stem cell's specialization process and harmful mutations 
occur in the cell's DNA. Cells with compromised DNA
are supposed to self-destruct, but some damaged cells ignore this order, replicating uncontrollably,
even as they lose their original function. These are what we know as cancer cells. It is not yet clear why leukemia
is the most common childhood cancer, but one contributing factor may be that leukemias are often caused
by just one or two DNA modifications, while most cancers require many of them, allowing leukemias to arise faster
than other types of cancer. Moreover, some DNA alterations
can occur in white blood cells during fetal development, further increasing the risk 
of early leukemia. But though it affects more children
than any other cancer, adults constitute the majority
of leukemia patients overall. Once leukemia strikes, the damaged cells
reproduce in the blood and the bone marrow until they take up 
all available space and resources. When the bone marrow 
can no longer produce the required amount of functional cells, the blood becomes depleted. The lack of red blood cells means that muscles 
don't get enough oxygen, the reduced number of platelets
is not sufficient to repair wounds, and the dearth of functional white
blood cells impairs the immune system, increasing the risk of infections. To restore the normal 
function of the blood, leukemic cells have to be eliminated. But because leukemias 
are not solid tumors, they can't be removed surgically. Instead, the cells are killed
inside the body using various treatments that include chemotherapy, a combination of drugs that destroys
quickly multiplying cells. Unfortunately, this has the side effect
of killing healthy cells, such as those found in hair follicles
or intestines. And in some cases, the dosage 
required is so high that it kills all cells 
in the bone marrow, including stem cells. When this happens, the body is no longer
able to create new blood cells on its own. Fortunately, outside help can come
in the form of stem cells from the bone marrow of a donor. Once transplanted into the patient, they rapidly repopulate 
the bone marrow and the blood. However, bone marrow transplants
are a complicated process requiring antigen compatibility
between the donor and recipient to keep the transplanted cells from
from attacking the patient's own cells as foreign bodies. Unlike with blood transplants, there are thousands of HLA types, and even siblings and close relatives
may not have compatible bone marrow. If this is the case, the search 
is expanded to a database containing the genetic makeup of millions
of voluntary bone marrow donors. The more potential donors there are, the more patients lives can be saved
through successful transplants. Leukemia may be a frightening disease,
but there is strength and hope in numbers.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Doctors can't use surgery to remove leukemia because:

**Transcript**:
They're everywhere, 
but you will never see one. Trillions of them are flying 
through you right this second, but you can't feel them. These ghost particles are called neutrinos
and if we can catch them, they can tell us about 
the furthest reaches and most extreme environments 
of the universe. Neutrinos are elementary particles, meaning that they can't be subdivided
into other particles the way atoms can. Elementary particles are the smallest
known building blocks of everything in the universe, and the neutrino is one 
of the smallest of the small. A million times less massive 
than an electron, neutrinos fly easily through matter,
unaffected by magnetic fields. In fact, they hardly ever 
interact with anything. That means that they can travel
through the universe in a straight line for millions, or even billions, of years, safely carrying information 
about where they came from. So where do they come from? Pretty much everywhere. They're produced in your body
from the radioactive decay of potassium. Cosmic rays hitting atoms 
in the Earth's atmosphere create showers of them. They're produced by nuclear 
reactions inside the sun and by radioactive 
decay inside the Earth. And we can generate them 
in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. But the highest energy neutrinos
are born far out in space in environments that 
we know very little about. Something out there,
maybe supermassive black holes, or maybe some cosmic dynamo
we've yet to discover, accelerates cosmic rays to energies
over a million times greater than anything human-built
accelerators have achieved. These cosmic rays, 
most of which are protons, interact violently with the matter
and radiation around them, producing high-energy neutrinos, which propagate out 
like cosmic breadcrumbs that can tell us about the locations and interiors of the universe's most
powerful cosmic engines. That is, if we can catch them. Neutrinos' limited interactions
with other matter might make them great messengers, but it also makes them 
extremely hard to detect. One way to do so is to put a huge volume
of pure transparent material in their path and wait for a neutrino to reveal itself by colliding with the nucleus of an atom. That's what's happening 
in Antarctica at IceCube, the world's largest neutrino telescope. It's set up within 
a cubic kilometer of ice that has been purified by the pressure of thousands of years 
of accumulated ice and snow, to the point where it's one 
of the clearest solids on Earth. And even though it's shot through with
boreholes holding over 5,000 detectors, most of the cosmic neutrinos racing
through IceCube will never leave a trace. But about ten times a year, a single high-energy neutrino
collides with a molecule of ice, shooting off sparks of charged
subatomic particles that travel faster through the ice
than light does. In a similar way to how a jet
that exceeds the speed of sound produces a sonic boom, these superluminal charged particles
leave behind a cone of blue light, kind of a photonic boom. This light spreads through IceCube, hitting some of its detectors
located over a mile beneath the surface. Photomultiplier tubes amplify the signal, which contains information about 
the charged particles' paths and energies. The data are beamed 
to astrophysicists around the world who look at the patterns of light for clues about the neutrinos 
that produced them. These super energetic collisions
are so rare that IceCube's scientists give each
neutrino nicknames, like Big Bird and Dr. Strangepork. IceCube has already observed the highest energy 
cosmic neutrinos ever seen. The neutrinos it detects should finally
tell us where cosmic rays come from and how they reached 
such extreme energies. Light, from infrared,
to x-rays, to gamma rays, has given us increasingly energetic and continuously surprising 
views of the universe. We are now at the dawn
of the age of neutrino astronomy, and we have no idea 
what revelations IceCube and other neutrino telescopes may bring us about the universe's most violent,
most energetic phenomena.

**Transcript**:
They're everywhere, 
but you will never see one. Trillions of them are flying 
through you right this second, but you can't feel them. These ghost particles are called neutrinos
and if we can catch them, they can tell us about 
the furthest reaches and most extreme environments 
of the universe. Neutrinos are elementary particles, meaning that they can't be subdivided
into other particles the way atoms can. Elementary particles are the smallest
known building blocks of everything in the universe, and the neutrino is one 
of the smallest of the small. A million times less massive 
than an electron, neutrinos fly easily through matter,
unaffected by magnetic fields. In fact, they hardly ever 
interact with anything. That means that they can travel
through the universe in a straight line for millions, or even billions, of years, safely carrying information 
about where they came from. So where do they come from? Pretty much everywhere. They're produced in your body
from the radioactive decay of potassium. Cosmic rays hitting atoms 
in the Earth's atmosphere create showers of them. They're produced by nuclear 
reactions inside the sun and by radioactive 
decay inside the Earth. And we can generate them 
in nuclear reactors and particle accelerators. But the highest energy neutrinos
are born far out in space in environments that 
we know very little about. Something out there,
maybe supermassive black holes, or maybe some cosmic dynamo
we've yet to discover, accelerates cosmic rays to energies
over a million times greater than anything human-built
accelerators have achieved. These cosmic rays, 
most of which are protons, interact violently with the matter
and radiation around them, producing high-energy neutrinos, which propagate out 
like cosmic breadcrumbs that can tell us about the locations and interiors of the universe's most
powerful cosmic engines. That is, if we can catch them. Neutrinos' limited interactions
with other matter might make them great messengers, but it also makes them 
extremely hard to detect. One way to do so is to put a huge volume
of pure transparent material in their path and wait for a neutrino to reveal itself by colliding with the nucleus of an atom. That's what's happening 
in Antarctica at IceCube, the world's largest neutrino telescope. It's set up within 
a cubic kilometer of ice that has been purified by the pressure of thousands of years 
of accumulated ice and snow, to the point where it's one 
of the clearest solids on Earth. And even though it's shot through with
boreholes holding over 5,000 detectors, most of the cosmic neutrinos racing
through IceCube will never leave a trace. But about ten times a year, a single high-energy neutrino
collides with a molecule of ice, shooting off sparks of charged
subatomic particles that travel faster through the ice
than light does. In a similar way to how a jet
that exceeds the speed of sound produces a sonic boom, these superluminal charged particles
leave behind a cone of blue light, kind of a photonic boom. This light spreads through IceCube, hitting some of its detectors
located over a mile beneath the surface. Photomultiplier tubes amplify the signal, which contains information about 
the charged particles' paths and energies. The data are beamed 
to astrophysicists around the world who look at the patterns of light for clues about the neutrinos 
that produced them. These super energetic collisions
are so rare that IceCube's scientists give each
neutrino nicknames, like Big Bird and Dr. Strangepork. IceCube has already observed the highest energy 
cosmic neutrinos ever seen. The neutrinos it detects should finally
tell us where cosmic rays come from and how they reached 
such extreme energies. Light, from infrared,
to x-rays, to gamma rays, has given us increasingly energetic and continuously surprising 
views of the universe. We are now at the dawn
of the age of neutrino astronomy, and we have no idea 
what revelations IceCube and other neutrino telescopes may bring us about the universe's most violent,
most energetic phenomena.

**Transcript**:
This is a kindergarten
we designed in 2007. We made this kindergarten 
to be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation
on top of the roof. If you are a parent, you know that kids love
to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this? The principal of this kindergarten said, "No, I don't want a handrail." I said, "It's impossible." But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof? So that it can catch
the children falling off?" (Laughter) I said, "It's impossible." And of course,
the government official said, "Of course you have to have a handrail." But we could keep 
that idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call 
this rope as a handrail. But of course, rope has nothing
to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more, and more, more. (Laughter) Sometimes 40 children 
are around a tree. The boy on the branch, he loves the tree
so he is eating the tree. (Laughter) And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. (Laughter) Feeding time. (Laughter) 
(Applause) And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see
children on top of the roof, not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high,
you see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place --
there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water
to your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's putting water into his boots. (Laughter) This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year. And there is no boundary
between inside and outside. So it means basically
this architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary
between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back. (Laughter) But the point is,
in that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. But here, just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly, we consider
noise very important. You know that children
sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten, these children show
amazing concentration in class. And you know, our kind grew up
in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know, you can talk
to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know, these days we are trying to make
everything under control. You know, it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is 50 degrees. And also, you should know
that you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So, children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. (Laughter) I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always 
some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish
another monkey from above. (Laughter) Monkeys. (Laughter) And each classroom has
at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus
comes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building, right next to that
oval-shaped kindergarten. The building is only
five meters tall with seven floors. And of course,
the ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So, we put our children,
a daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. (Laughter) And he is trying to see
if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful
in Tokyo, as you know. (Laughter) The driver in front,
she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days, kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of
opportunity we are losing these days. Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten
do 4,000 meters on average. And these children have
the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says, "I don't train them.
We leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep." (Laughter) They keep running. (Laughter) My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable
of changing this world, and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts
to change the lives of children. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Imagine the brain could reboot, updating its withered and damaged cells
with new, improved units. That may sound like science fiction, but it's a potential reality
scientists are investigating right now. Will our brains one day 
be able to self-repair? It's well known that embryonic cells
in our young developing brains produce new neurons, the microscopic units 
that make up the brain's tissue. Those newly generated neurons migrate
to various parts of the developing brain, making it self-organize 
into different structures. But until recently, scientists thought cell production came to
an abrupt halt soon after this initial growth, leading them to conclude 
that neurological diseases, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and damaging events, like strokes,
are irreversible. But a series of recent discoveries has revealed that adult brains 
actually do continue to produce new cells in at least three specialized locations. This process, known as neurogenesis, involves dedicated brain cells,
called neural stem cells and progenitor cells, which manufacture new neurons
or replace the old ones. The three regions where neurogenesis
has been discovered are the dentate gyrus,
associated with learning and memory, the subventricular zone, which may
supply neurons to the olfactory bulb for communication 
between the nose and brain, and the striatum, 
which helps manage movement. Scientists don't yet have a good grasp
on exactly what role neurogenesis plays 
in any of these regions, or why they have this ability 
that's absent from the rest of the brain, but the mere presence of a mechanism
to grown new neurons in the adult brain opens up an amazing possibility. Could we harness that mechanism
to get the brain to heal its scars similar to how new skin
grows to patch up a wound, or a broken bone 
stitches itself back together? So here's where we stand. Certain proteins and other small molecules
that mimick those proteins can be administered to the brain to make neural stem cells 
and progenitor cells produce more neurons 
in those three locations. This technique still needs improvement so that the cells 
reproduce more efficiently and more cells survive. But research shows that progenitor cells
from these areas can actually migrate to places where
injury has occurred and give rise to new neurons there. And another promising possible approach is to transplant healthy 
human neural stem cells, which are cultured in a laboratory,
to injured tissue, like we can do with skin. Scientists are currently experimenting to determine whether transplanted
donor cells can divide, differentiate and successfully give rise 
to new neurons in a damaged brain. They've also discovered that we might be able to teach
other kinds of brain cells, such as astrocytes
or oligodendrocytes to behave like neural stem cells
and start generating neurons, too. So, a couple of decades from now
will our brains be able to self-repair? We can't say for sure, but that has become one of the major 
goals of regenerative medicine. The human brain has 100 billion neurons and we're still figuring out the wiring
behind this huge biological motherboard. But everyday, research on neurogenesis
brings us closer to that reboot switch.

**Transcript**:
If you could choose one vegetable to serve a king, what would it be? The extravagant French king Louis XIV demanded that cauliflower be served at all his feasts. It had something to do with a girlfriend who liked cauliflower... but maybe he knew that this common member of the cabbage family has a positively royal pedigree - when it comes to health: one cup of cauliflower has more Vitamin C than an orange; it's high in fiber, which helps digestion; and it's packed with cancer fighting antioxidants. When we eat cauliflower, we're actually eating a flower! In fact, we're eating hundreds of immature flowers that are bonded together into little lumps called curds. China and India throw the most cauliflower, but in the US, it's California - and that's where we've come to find out: How Does It Grow? We're here in Watsonville, Santa Cruz, at Lakeside Organic Gardens - one of the country's largest family-owned organic farms. Lakeside grows many different crops, including five million heads of cauliflower each year. First, they prepare the earth with fertilizer. (Dick): In our business we have a saying: "We farm the soil, and the soil grows the crop." Because lakeside grows their cauliflower organically, that means they don't use chemical sprays to kill the bugs that eat the cauliflower plant; instead, they release predators like ladybugs that like to eat the bad insects. (Dick): We grow plants that attract the good bugs. (Nicole): Is that like these white flowers that you see here? (Dick): Yeah, these are Sweet Alyssum. So you'll see them around the edge of our field. They also use a natural soap spray, since bugs breathe through their skin when the soap covers their body they suffocate. But there's another secret to growing cauliflower organically: penguin poop. Lakeside is the country's largest importer of Peruvian Guano - aka seabird excrement. Guano is used as a fertilizer and is super rich in nitrogen because of all the fish those seabirds eat. And nitrogen is key to plant growth - it's a main ingredient in chlorophyll - the substance that plants make to convert sunlight to energy. When the cauliflower is the size of a tennis ball, farmers take some of the biggest leaves, and tie them over the head. They do this for one reason only: we like our cauliflower white. If the head is exposed to the sun, it turns yellow and even though it tastes exactly the same, we won't buy it! (Dick): what we throw away in California for cosmetic reasons could end World Hunger... When the cauliflower is 6 to 8 inches in diameter, the harvest begins. Right in the field, the cauliflower is trimmed and wrapped. Before being shipped, it will be cooled down to preserve its freshness. If the cauliflower is harvested too late, the curds begin to pull apart within just two days - that's when you can really see how the cauliflower is just a big bouquet of flowers waiting to bloom. Cauliflower is delicious. Cut up and roasted in the oven at high heat - the natural sugars caramelize, it gets tender and sweet. But for the love of God, don't boil it - it'll turn to mush! And that is no way to treat a vegetable fit for a king

(Dick): In our business we have a saying: "We farm the soil, and the soil grows the crop." Because lakeside grows their cauliflower organically, that means they don't use chemical sprays to kill the bugs that eat the cauliflower plant; instead, they release predators like ladybugs that like to eat the bad insects. (Dick): We grow plants that attract the good bugs. (Nicole): Is that like these white flowers that you see here? (Dick): Yeah, these are Sweet Alyssum. So you'll see them around the edge of our field. They also use a natural soap spray, since bugs breathe through their skin when the soap covers their body they suffocate. But there's another secret to growing cauliflower organically: penguin poop. Lakeside is the country's largest importer of Peruvian Guano - aka seabird excrement. Guano is used as a fertilizer and is super rich in nitrogen because of all the fish those seabirds eat. And nitrogen is key to plant growth - it's a main ingredient in chlorophyll - the substance that plants make to convert sunlight to energy. When the cauliflower is the size of a tennis ball, farmers take some of the biggest leaves, and tie them over the head. They do this for one reason only: we like our cauliflower white. If the head is exposed to the sun, it turns yellow and even though it tastes exactly the same, we won't buy it! (Dick): what we throw away in California for cosmetic reasons could end World Hunger... When the cauliflower is 6 to 8 inches in diameter, the harvest begins. Right in the field, the cauliflower is trimmed and wrapped. Before being shipped, it will be cooled down to preserve its freshness. If the cauliflower is harvested too late, the curds begin to pull apart within just two days - that's when you can really see how the cauliflower is just a big bouquet of flowers waiting to bloom. Cauliflower is delicious. Cut up and roasted in the oven at high heat - the natural sugars caramelize, it gets tender and sweet. But for the love of God, don't boil it - it'll turn to mush! And that is no way to treat a vegetable fit for a king

If you could choose one vegetable to serve a king, what would it be? The extravagant French king Louis XIV demanded that cauliflower be served at all his feasts. It had something to do with a girlfriend who liked cauliflower... but maybe he knew that this common member of the cabbage family has a positively royal pedigree - when it comes to health: one cup of cauliflower has more Vitamin C than an orange; it's high in fiber, which helps digestion; and it's packed with cancer fighting antioxidants. When we eat cauliflower, we're actually eating a flower! In fact, we're eating hundreds of immature flowers that are bonded together into little lumps called curds.

**Transcript**:
It's so obvious 
that it's practically proverbial. You can't unboil an egg. Well, it turns out you can, sort of. What thermal energy 
does to the eggs' molecules, mechanical energy can undo. Eggs are mostly made 
of water and proteins. The proteins start off 
folded up into intricate shapes, held together by weak chemical bonds. Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold,
uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing. The newly liberated proteins 
bump up against their neighbors and start to form 
new bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled
that they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg. That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not. According to a chemical idea called the principle 
of microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, 
like egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen
if you retrace your steps. But adding more heat will tangle
the proteins further, and cooling them down
will only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast. I'm not kidding. Here's how it works. First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,
coating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them 
to glide past each other. Then, they spin that solution 
in a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution 
spread out into a thin film. Here's the key part. The solution nearest
the wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle. That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch 
and contract the proteins until eventually they snap back
into their native shapes and stay there. By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back 
in its original unboiled state. This technique works 
with all sorts of proteins. Bigger, messier proteins can be
more resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress
and encourages it to fold up first. This unboiling method won't work
with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread
throughout a cylindrical chamber. But the applications go way beyond
uncooking your breakfast, anyhow. Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins
that are extremely expensive to produce, partly because they get stuck 
in tangled up aggregates, just like cooked egg whites and have to be untangled and refolded
before they can do their jobs. This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier, cheaper 
and quicker method than other ways to refold proteins, so it may allow new drugs to be made
available to more people faster. And there's one more thing 
you need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food. Boiling an egg is actually
an unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way
proteins are shaped and bound together, it doesn't actually change 
their chemical identity. Most types of cooking are more like
the famous Maillard reaction, which makes chemical changes that turn sugars and proteins
into delicious caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo. So you might be able to unboil your egg, but I'm sorry to say 
you can't unfry it...yet.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's so obvious 
that it's practically proverbial. You can't unboil an egg. Well, it turns out you can, sort of. What thermal energy 
does to the eggs' molecules, mechanical energy can undo. Eggs are mostly made 
of water and proteins. The proteins start off 
folded up into intricate shapes, held together by weak chemical bonds. Adding heat disrupts those bonds, allowing the proteins to unfold,
uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing. The newly liberated proteins 
bump up against their neighbors and start to form 
new bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled
that they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg. That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not. According to a chemical idea called the principle 
of microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, 
like egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen
if you retrace your steps. But adding more heat will tangle
the proteins further, and cooling them down
will only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast. I'm not kidding. Here's how it works. First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,
coating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them 
to glide past each other. Then, they spin that solution 
in a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution 
spread out into a thin film. Here's the key part. The solution nearest
the wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle. That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch 
and contract the proteins until eventually they snap back
into their native shapes and stay there. By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back 
in its original unboiled state. This technique works 
with all sorts of proteins. Bigger, messier proteins can be
more resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress
and encourages it to fold up first. This unboiling method won't work
with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread

uncoil, unwind and wiggle freely. This process is called denaturing. The newly liberated proteins 
bump up against their neighbors and start to form 
new bonds with each other, more and more as the heat increases, until finally, they're so entangled
that they gel into a solid mass, a boiled egg. That entanglement might look 
permanent, but it's not. According to a chemical idea called the principle 
of microscopic reversibility, anything that happens, 
like egg proteins seizing up, can theoretically unhappen
if you retrace your steps. But adding more heat will tangle
the proteins further, and cooling them down
will only freeze them, so here's the trick: spin them around ridiculously fast. I'm not kidding. Here's how it works. First, scientists dissolve 
boiled egg whites in water with a chemical called urea, a small molecule that acts as a lubricant,
coating the proteins' long strands and making it easier for them 
to glide past each other. Then, they spin that solution 
in a glass tube at a breakneck 5000 rotations per minute, making the solution 
spread out into a thin film. Here's the key part. The solution nearest
the wall spins faster than the solution closer to the middle. That difference in velocity 
creates sheer stresses that repeatedly stretch 
and contract the proteins until eventually they snap back
into their native shapes and stay there. By the time the centrifuge stops spinning, the egg white is back 
in its original unboiled state. This technique works 
with all sorts of proteins. Bigger, messier proteins can be
more resistant to being pulled apart, so scientists attach 
a plastic bead to one end that adds extra stress
and encourages it to fold up first. This unboiling method won't work
with a whole egg in its shell since the solution has to spread
throughout a cylindrical chamber. But the applications go way beyond
uncooking your breakfast, anyhow. Many pharmaceuticals consist of proteins
that are extremely expensive to produce, partly because they get stuck 
in tangled up aggregates, just like cooked egg whites and have to be untangled and refolded
before they can do their jobs. This spinning technique has the potential to be an easier, cheaper 
and quicker method than other ways to refold proteins, so it may allow new drugs to be made
available to more people faster. And there's one more thing 
you need to keep in mind before trying to uncook all of your food. Boiling an egg is actually
an unusual cooking process because even though it changes the way
proteins are shaped and bound together, it doesn't actually change 
their chemical identity. Most types of cooking are more like
the famous Maillard reaction, which makes chemical changes that turn sugars and proteins
into delicious caramel crunchiness and are a lot harder to undo. So you might be able to unboil your egg, but I'm sorry to say 
you can't unfry it...yet.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's estimated that 
for every 10,000 bills in the U.S., one of those bills is fake. That may not sound like much, but it adds up to millions of dollars
in cold hard cash. Counterfeit money has the potential
to cause all sorts of problems, from leaving you short $20
to destabilizing national economies. But don't worry. You can help catch the counterfeits. All you need are some simple tools
and a bit of chemistry. First up, the anti-counterfeit 
detection pen. The pen looks like a highlighter and contains a solution 
of potassium iodide and elemental iodine. It reveals of the presence of starch, which is commonly used 
to strengthen regular printer paper, but won't be found in real money. That's because authentic bills
are made of cotton and linen and are threaded with tiny 
red and blue fibers. That material is made by a single,
highly-guarded company called Crane and Company, which has been printing currency since Paul Revere asked them 
to help finance the Revolutionary War. The starch in many counterfeit bills,
on the other hand, is made of two molecules: amylopectin and amylose. It's amylose that gives the fake away. Its long chain of sugar molecules
connected by oxygen atoms forms a helical structure, like DNA. Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil, forming a new compound
that leaves a dark mark on the paper. However, in the absence of starch,
there is no chemical reaction and the mark will look light yellow. So if the fake isn't printed 
on starchy paper, iodine solutions can't help you. That's one of the reasons 
U.S. bills printed since 1996 have been chemically enhanced to include
another counterfeit countermeasure: a strip that fluoresces under UV light. That's the same kind of light
used at black light parties and airport security lines. The polyester strip 
printed with invisble ink is just one millimeter wide and is found in different positions
depending on a bill's value. If you hold your dollar 
up to natural light, you can see the amount 
and the word USA printed on the band. But under UV light, 
these strips really shine. They contain molecules that can be excited
by absorbing certain amounts of energy, specifically, that given off 
by common UV light sources. As these excited molecules return
to their original states, they lose a bit of energy as heat
and then radiate the rest as light. Energy is inversely related to wavelength, which means that the longer wavelengths
have lower energy. So the lower energy light 
given off by the strip means longer wavelengths
that fall in the visible range, and suddenly we can see that 
which had been invisible. And if a glowing strip doesn't show up
on a recent bill, you have a fake on your hands. For times when you're not dealing 
with counterfeit masterminds, looking for simple visual cues will do. Make sure the portrait 
looks lifelike and not flat, the seal has perfectly 
even sawtooth points, the inked border is unbroken, and the serial number has precisely 
equal spacing between each number. So the next time you come across 
some dubious dough, have a closer look, pull out your iodine solution, or take it to a rave and you just might catch a counterfeit.

**Transcript**:
It's estimated that 
for every 10,000 bills in the U.S., one of those bills is fake. That may not sound like much, but it adds up to millions of dollars
in cold hard cash. Counterfeit money has the potential
to cause all sorts of problems, from leaving you short $20
to destabilizing national economies. But don't worry. You can help catch the counterfeits. All you need are some simple tools
and a bit of chemistry. First up, the anti-counterfeit 
detection pen. The pen looks like a highlighter and contains a solution 
of potassium iodide and elemental iodine. It reveals of the presence of starch, which is commonly used 
to strengthen regular printer paper, but won't be found in real money. That's because authentic bills
are made of cotton and linen and are threaded with tiny 
red and blue fibers. That material is made by a single,
highly-guarded company called Crane and Company, which has been printing currency since Paul Revere asked them 
to help finance the Revolutionary War. The starch in many counterfeit bills,
on the other hand, is made of two molecules: amylopectin and amylose. It's amylose that gives the fake away. Its long chain of sugar molecules
connected by oxygen atoms forms a helical structure, like DNA. Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil, forming a new compound
that leaves a dark mark on the paper. However, in the absence of starch,
there is no chemical reaction and the mark will look light yellow. So if the fake isn't printed 
on starchy paper, iodine solutions can't help you. That's one of the reasons 
U.S. bills printed since 1996 have been chemically enhanced to include
another counterfeit countermeasure: a strip that fluoresces under UV light. That's the same kind of light
used at black light parties and airport security lines. The polyester strip 
printed with invisble ink is just one millimeter wide and is found in different positions
depending on a bill's value. If you hold your dollar 
up to natural light, you can see the amount 
and the word USA printed on the band. But under UV light, 
these strips really shine. They contain molecules that can be excited
by absorbing certain amounts of energy, specifically, that given off 
by common UV light sources. As these excited molecules return
to their original states, they lose a bit of energy as heat
and then radiate the rest as light. Energy is inversely related to wavelength, which means that the longer wavelengths
have lower energy. So the lower energy light 
given off by the strip means longer wavelengths
that fall in the visible range, and suddenly we can see that 
which had been invisible. And if a glowing strip doesn't show up
on a recent bill, you have a fake on your hands. For times when you're not dealing 
with counterfeit masterminds, looking for simple visual cues will do. Make sure the portrait 
looks lifelike and not flat, the seal has perfectly 
even sawtooth points, the inked border is unbroken, and the serial number has precisely 
equal spacing between each number. So the next time you come across 
some dubious dough, have a closer look, pull out your iodine solution, or take it to a rave and you just might catch a counterfeit.

**Transcript**:
As the story goes, 
the legendary marksman William Tell was forced into a cruel challenge
by a corrupt lord. William's son was to be executed unless William could shoot 
an apple off his head. William succeeded, but let's imagine
two variations on the tale. In the first variation, the lord hires a bandit to steal
William's trusty crossbow, so he is forced to borrow
an inferior one from a peasant. However, the borrowed crossbow
isn't adjusted perfectly, and William finds that his practice shots cluster in a tight spread 
beneath the bullseye. Fortunately, he has time 
to correct for it before it's too late. Variation two: William begins to doubt his skills
in the long hours before the challenge and his hand develops a tremor. His practice shots still cluster
around the apple but in a random pattern. Occasionally, he hits the apple, but with the wobble,
there is no guarantee of a bullseye. He must settle his nervous hand and restore the certainty in his aim
to save his son. At the heart of these variations
are two terms often used interchangeably: accuracy and precision. The distinction between the two is actually critical 
for many scientific endeavours. Accuracy involves how close you come
to the correct result. Your accuracy improves with tools
that are calibrated correctly and that you're well-trained on. Precision, on the other hand, is how consistently you can get 
that result using the same method. Your precision improves 
with more finely incremented tools that require less estimation. The story of the stolen crossbow
was one of precision without accuracy. William got the same wrong result
each time he fired. The variation with the shaky hand
was one of accuracy without precision. William's bolts clustered 
around the correct result, but without certainty of a bullseye
for any given shot. You can probably get away 
with low accuracy or low precision in everyday tasks. But engineers and researchers
often require accuracy on microscopic levels with 
a high certainty of being right every time. Factories and labs increase precision through better equipment 
and more detailed procedures. These improvements can be expensive,
so managers must decide what the acceptable uncertainty 
for each project is. However, investments in precision can take us beyond 
what was previously possible, even as far as Mars. It may surprise you that NASA
does not know exactly where their probes are going to touch down
on another planet. Predicting where they will land
requires extensive calculations fed by measurements 
that don't always have a precise answer. How does the Martian atmosphere's density
change at different elevations? What angle will the probe
hit the atmosphere at? What will be the speed 
of the probe upon entry? Computer simulators run thousands
of different landing scenarios, mixing and matching values
for all of the variables. Weighing all the possibilities, the computer spits out 
the potential area of impact in the form of a landing ellipse. In 1976, the landing ellipse
for the Mars Viking Lander was 62 x 174 miles,
nearly the area of New Jersey. With such a limitation, NASA had to ignore many interesting
but risky landing areas. Since then, new information 
about the Martian atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations
have drastically reduced uncertainty. In 2012, the landing ellipse 
for the Curiosity Lander was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long, an area more than 200 times 
smaller than Viking's. This allowed NASA to target 
a specific spot in Gale Crater, a previously un-landable area 
of high scientific interest. While we ultimately strive for accuracy, precision reflects our certainty
of reliably achieving it. With these two principles in mind, we can shoot for the stars and be confident 
of hitting them every time.

does not know exactly where their probes are going to touch down
on another planet. Predicting where they will land
requires extensive calculations fed by measurements 
that don't always have a precise answer. How does the Martian atmosphere's density
change at different elevations? What angle will the probe
hit the atmosphere at? What will be the speed 
of the probe upon entry? Computer simulators run thousands
of different landing scenarios, mixing and matching values
for all of the variables. Weighing all the possibilities, the computer spits out 
the potential area of impact in the form of a landing ellipse. In 1976, the landing ellipse
for the Mars Viking Lander was 62 x 174 miles,
nearly the area of New Jersey. With such a limitation, NASA had to ignore many interesting
but risky landing areas. Since then, new information 
about the Martian atmosphere, improved spacecraft technology, and more powerful computer simulations
have drastically reduced uncertainty. In 2012, the landing ellipse 
for the Curiosity Lander was only 4 miles wide by 12 miles long, an area more than 200 times 
smaller than Viking's. This allowed NASA to target 
a specific spot in Gale Crater, a previously un-landable area 
of high scientific interest. While we ultimately strive for accuracy, precision reflects our certainty
of reliably achieving it. With these two principles in mind, we can shoot for the stars and be confident 
of hitting them every time.

Why are most manhole covers round? Sure, it makes them easy to roll
and slide into place in any alignment but there's another more compelling reason involving a peculiar geometric property
of circles and other shapes. Imagine a square 
separating two parallel lines. As it rotates, the lines first push apart,
then come back together. But try this with a circle and the lines stay 
exactly the same distance apart, the diameter of the circle. This makes the circle unlike the square, a mathematical shape 
called a curve of constant width. Another shape with this property
is the Reuleaux triangle. To create one, 
start with an equilateral triangle, then make one of the vertices the center
of a circle that touches the other two. Draw two more circles in the same way,
centered on the other two vertices, and there it is, in the space 
where they all overlap. Because Reuleaux triangles can rotate
between parallel lines without changing their distance, they can work as wheels,
provided a little creative engineering. And if you rotate one while rolling
its midpoint in a nearly circular path, its perimeter traces out a square
with rounded corners, allowing triangular drill bits
to carve out square holes. Any polygon with an odd number of sides can be used to generate 
a curve of constant width using the same method we applied earlier, though there are many others
that aren't made in this way. For example, if you roll any 
curve of constant width around another, you'll make a third one. This collection of pointy curves
fascinates mathematicians. They've given us Barbier's theorem, which says that the perimeter 
of any curve of constant width, not just a circle,
equals pi times the diameter. Another theorem tells us that if you had
a bunch of curves of constant width with the same width, they would all have the same perimeter, but the Reuleaux triangle 
would have the smallest area. The circle, which is effectively 
a Reuleaux polygon with an infinite number of sides,
has the largest. In three dimensions, we can make 
surfaces of constant width, like the Reuleaux tetrahedron, formed by taking a tetrahedron, expanding a sphere from each vertex
until it touches the opposite vertices, and throwing everything away
except the region where they overlap. Surfaces of constant width maintain a constant distance 
between two parallel planes. So you could throw a bunch 
of Reuleaux tetrahedra on the floor, and slide a board across them
as smoothly as if they were marbles. Now back to manhole covers. A square manhole cover's short edge could line up with the wider part 
of the hole and fall right in. But a curve of constant width
won't fall in any orientation. Usually they're circular, 
but keep your eyes open, and you just might come across 
a Reuleaux triangle manhole.

its midpoint in a nearly circular path, its perimeter traces out a square
with rounded corners, allowing triangular drill bits
to carve out square holes. Any polygon with an odd number of sides can be used to generate 
a curve of constant width using the same method we applied earlier, though there are many others
that aren't made in this way. For example, if you roll any 
curve of constant width around another, you'll make a third one. This collection of pointy curves
fascinates mathematicians. They've given us Barbier's theorem, which says that the perimeter 
of any curve of constant width, not just a circle,
equals pi times the diameter. Another theorem tells us that if you had
a bunch of curves of constant width with the same width, they would all have the same perimeter, but the Reuleaux triangle 
would have the smallest area. The circle, which is effectively 
a Reuleaux polygon with an infinite number of sides,
has the largest. In three dimensions, we can make 
surfaces of constant width, like the Reuleaux tetrahedron, formed by taking a tetrahedron, expanding a sphere from each vertex
until it touches the opposite vertices, and throwing everything away
except the region where they overlap. Surfaces of constant width maintain a constant distance 
between two parallel planes. So you could throw a bunch 
of Reuleaux tetrahedra on the floor, and slide a board across them
as smoothly as if they were marbles. Now back to manhole covers. A square manhole cover's short edge could line up with the wider part 
of the hole and fall right in. But a curve of constant width
won't fall in any orientation. Usually they're circular, 
but keep your eyes open, and you just might come across 
a Reuleaux triangle manhole.

**Transcript**:
It can strike without warning,
at any moment. You may be walking across a soft carpet
and reaching for the door knob when suddenly...zap! To understand static electricity, we first need to know a bit
about the nature of matter. All matter is made up of atoms that consist of three 
types of smaller particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutral neutrons. Normally, the electrons and protons
in an atom balance out, which is why most matter you come across
is electrically neutral. But electrons are tiny 
and almost insignificant in mass, and rubbing or friction can give
loosely bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms
and attach to others, migrating between different surfaces. When this happens, the first object is left 
with more protons than electrons and becomes positively charged, while the one with more electrons
accumulates a negative charge. This situation is called
a charge imbalance, or net charge separation. But nature tends towards balance, so when one of these newly charged bodies
comes into contact with another material, the mobile electrons 
will take the first chance they get to go where they're most needed, either jumping off the negatively
charged object, or jumping onto 
the positively charged one in an attempt to restore 
the neutral charge equilibrium. And this quick movement of electrons,
called static discharge, is what we recognize as that sudden spark. This process doesn't happen 
with just any objects. Otherwise you'd be getting 
zapped all the time. Conductors like metals and salt water tend to have loosely 
bound outer electrons, which can easily flow between molecules. On the other hand, insulators 
like plastics, rubber and glass have tightly bound electrons
that won't readily jump to other atoms. Static build-up is most likely to occur when one of the materials involved
is an insulator. When you walk across a rug, electrons from your body
will rub off onto it, while the rug's insulating wool
will resist losing its own electrons. Although your body and the rug
together are still electrically neutral, there is now a charge polarization
between the two. And when you reach to touch the door knob, zap! The metal door knob's loosely 
bound electrons hop to your hand to replace the electrons 
your body has lost. When it happens in your bedroom,
it's a minor nuisance. But in the great outdoors, static electricity can be a terrifying,
destructive force of nature. In certain conditions,
charge separation will occur in clouds. We don't know exactly how this happens. It may have to do with the circulation
of water droplets and ice particles within them. Regardless, the charge 
imbalance is neutralized by being released towards another body, such as a building, the Earth, or another cloud in a giant spark
that we know as lightning. And just as your fingers can be zapped
over and over in the same spot, you better believe that lightning 
can strike the same place more than once.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
There is a curse that has plagued humanity
since ancient times. The Greeks fought it by chewing
aromatic resins, while the Chinese resorted to egg shells. In the ancient Jewish Talmud, it's even considered 
legal grounds for divorce. This horrible scourge is halitosis,
otherwise known as bad breath. But what causes it,
and why is it so universally terrifying? Well, think of some of the worst
odors you can imagine, like garbage, feces or rotting meat. All of these smells come from the activity
of microorganisms, particularly bacteria, and, as disgusting as it may sound, similar bacteria live in the moisture-rich
environment of your mouth. Don't panic. The presence of bacteria in your body
is not only normal, it's actually vital 
for all sorts of things, like digestion and disease prevention. But like all living things,
bacteria need to eat. The bacteria in your mouth 
feed off of mucus, food remnants, and dead tissue cells. In order to absorb nutrients
through their cell membranes, they must break down the organic matter
into much smaller molecules. For example, they'll break proteins 
into their component amino acids and then break those down even further
into various compounds. Some of the foul-smelling 
byproducts of these reactions, such as hydrogen sulfide and cadaverine, escape into the air and waft their way 
towards unsuspecting noses. Our sensitivity to these odors
and interpretation of them as bad smells may be an evolutionary mechanism
warning us of rotten food and the presence of disease. Smell is one of our most intimate
and primal senses, playing a huge role 
in our attraction to potential mates. In one poll, 59% of men and 70% of women said they wouldn't go on a date 
with someone who has bad breath, which may be why Americans alone spend $1 billion a year 
on various breath products. Fortunately, most bad breath 
is easily treated. The worst smelling byproducts come from
gram-negative bacteria that live in the spaces 
between gums and teeth and on the back of the tongue. By brushing and flossing our teeth, using antibacterial mouthwash at bedtime, gently cleaning the back of the tongue
with a plastic scraper and even just eating a healthy breakfast, we can remove many of these bacteria
and their food sources. In some cases, 
these measures may not be enough due to dental problems, 
nasal conditions, or rarer ailments, such as liver disease 
and uncontrolled diabetes. Behaviors like smoking 
and excessive alcohol consumption also have a very recognizable odor. Regardless of cause, the bad smell almost 
always originates in the mouth and not the stomach 
or elsewhere in the body. But one of the biggest challenges lies in actually determining 
how our breath smells in the first place, and it's unclear why. It may be that 
we're too acclimatized to the smell inside 
our own mouths to judge it. And methods like cupping your hands
over your mouth, or licking and smelling your wrist
don't work perfectly either. One study showed 
that even when people do this, they tend to rate the smell subjectively according to how bad 
they thought it was going to be. But there's one simple,
if socially difficult, way of finding out how your breath smells: just take a deep breath and ask a friend.

**Transcript**:
It's midnight and all is still, except for the soft skittering 
of a gecko hunting a spider. Geckos seem to defy gravity, scaling vertical surfaces and walking upside down
without claws, adhesive glues or super-powered spiderwebs. Instead, they take advantage 
of a simple principle: that positive 
and negative charges attract. That attraction binds together 
compounds, like table salt, which is made of positively
charged sodium ions stuck to negatively charged chloride ions. But a gecko's feet aren't charged and neither are the surfaces 
they're walking on. So, what makes them stick? The answer lies in a clever combination
of intermolecular forces and stuctural engineering. All the elements in the periodic table
have a different affinity for electrons. Elements like oxygen and fluorine
really, really want electrons, while elements like hydrogen and lithium
don't attract them as strongly. An atom's relative greed for electrons
is called its electronegativity. Electrons are moving around all the time and can easily relocate
to wherever they're wanted most. So when there are atoms with different
electronegativities in the same molecule, the molecules cloud of electrons gets pulled towards 
the more electronegative atom. That creates a thin spot 
in the electron cloud where positive charge 
from the atomic nuclei shines through, as well as a negatively charged 
lump of electrons somewhere else. So the molecule itself isn't charged, but it does have positively 
and negatively charged patches. These patchy charges can attract
neighboring molecules to each other. They'll line up so that 
the positive spots on one are next to the negative 
spots on the other. There doesn't even have to be a strongly
electronegative atom to create these attractive forces. Electrons are always on the move, and sometimes they pile up 
temporarily in one spot. That flicker of charge is enough
to attract molecules to each other. Such interactions between 
uncharged molecules are called van der Waals forces. They're not as strong as the interactions
between charged particles, but if you have enough of them,
they can really add up. That's the gecko's secret. Gecko toes are padded 
with flexible ridges. Those ridges are covered 
in tiny hair-like structures, much thinner than human hair,
called setae. And each of the setae is covered 
in even tinier bristles called spatulae. Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect
for what the gecko needs them to do: stick and release on command. When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes
onto the ceiling, the spatulae hit at the perfect angle
for the van der Waals force to engage. The spatulae flatten, creating lots of surface area 
for their positively and negatively charged patches to find
complimentary patches on the ceiling. Each spatula only contributes a minuscule
amount of that van der Waals stickiness. But a gecko has about two billion of them, creating enough combined force 
to support its weight. In fact, the whole gecko could dangle
from a single one of its toes. That super stickiness 
can be broken, though, by changing the angle just a little bit. So, the gecko can peel its foot back off, scurrying towards a meal
or away from a predator. This strategy, using a forest 
of specially shaped bristles to maximize the van der Waals forces 
between ordinary molecules has inspired man-made materials designed to imitate 
the gecko's amazing adhesive ability. Artificial versions aren't as strong
as gecko toes quite yet, but they're good enough to allow 
a full-grown man to climb 25 feet up a glass wall. In fact, our gecko's prey is also using
van der Waals forces to stick to the ceiling. So, the gecko peels up its toes
and the chase is back on.

to wherever they're wanted most. So when there are atoms with different
electronegativities in the same molecule, the molecules cloud of electrons gets pulled towards 
the more electronegative atom. That creates a thin spot 
in the electron cloud where positive charge 
from the atomic nuclei shines through, as well as a negatively charged 
lump of electrons somewhere else. So the molecule itself isn't charged, but it does have positively 
and negatively charged patches. These patchy charges can attract
neighboring molecules to each other. They'll line up so that 
the positive spots on one are next to the negative 
spots on the other. There doesn't even have to be a strongly
electronegative atom to create these attractive forces. Electrons are always on the move, and sometimes they pile up 
temporarily in one spot. That flicker of charge is enough
to attract molecules to each other. Such interactions between 
uncharged molecules are called van der Waals forces. They're not as strong as the interactions
between charged particles, but if you have enough of them,
they can really add up. That's the gecko's secret. Gecko toes are padded 
with flexible ridges. Those ridges are covered 
in tiny hair-like structures, much thinner than human hair,
called setae. And each of the setae is covered 
in even tinier bristles called spatulae. Their tiny spatula-like shape is perfect
for what the gecko needs them to do: stick and release on command. When the gecko unfurls its flexible toes
onto the ceiling, the spatulae hit at the perfect angle
for the van der Waals force to engage. The spatulae flatten, creating lots of surface area 
for their positively and negatively charged patches to find
complimentary patches on the ceiling. Each spatula only contributes a minuscule
amount of that van der Waals stickiness. But a gecko has about two billion of them, creating enough combined force 
to support its weight. In fact, the whole gecko could dangle
from a single one of its toes. That super stickiness 
can be broken, though, by changing the angle just a little bit. So, the gecko can peel its foot back off, scurrying towards a meal
or away from a predator. This strategy, using a forest 
of specially shaped bristles to maximize the van der Waals forces 
between ordinary molecules has inspired man-made materials designed to imitate 
the gecko's amazing adhesive ability. Artificial versions aren't as strong
as gecko toes quite yet, but they're good enough to allow 
a full-grown man to climb 25 feet up a glass wall. In fact, our gecko's prey is also using
van der Waals forces to stick to the ceiling. So, the gecko peels up its toes
and the chase is back on.

**Transcript**:
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,
we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating
with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities
of those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing
this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings
and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life. I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you
a real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor. The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres
are completely separate. Because they process
information differently, each of our hemispheres
think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like
and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere
thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine." So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience. And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps
my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite
planes of reality. Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated
from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come
to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right
of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift
this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years
to completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power
of the universe, with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds. And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become
a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project
into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps
my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite
planes of reality. Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated
from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come
to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right
of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift
this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years
to completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power
of the universe, with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds. And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become
a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project
into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,
we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating
with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities
of those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing
this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings
and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life. I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you
a real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor. The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres
are completely separate. Because they process
information differently, each of our hemispheres
think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like
and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere
thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine." So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience. And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston

think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like
and what it sounds like. I am an energy-being connected
to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere
thinks in language. It's that ongoing brain chatter
that connects me and my internal world to my external world. It's that little voice that says to me, "Hey, you've got to remember
to pick up bananas on your way home. I need them in the morning." It's that calculating intelligence that reminds me
when I have to do my laundry. But perhaps most important,
it's that little voice that says to me, "I am. I am." And as soon as my left hemisphere
says to me "I am," I become separate. I become a single solid individual, separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you. And this was the portion of my brain
that I lost on the morning of my stroke. On the morning of the stroke, I woke up to a pounding
pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of caustic pain
that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me
to ever experience any kind of pain, so I thought, "OK, I'll just start
my normal routine." So I got up and I jumped
onto my cardio glider, which is a full-body,
full-exercise machine. And I'm jamming away on this thing, and I'm realizing that my hands
look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought, "That's very peculiar." And I looked down at my body and I thought,
"Whoa, I'm a weird-looking thing." And it was as though my consciousness
had shifted away from my normal perception of reality, where I'm the person on the machine
having the experience, to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself
having this experience. And it was all very peculiar,
and my headache was just getting worse. So I get off the machine, and I'm walking
across my living room floor, and I realize that everything
inside of my body has slowed way down. And every step is very rigid
and very deliberate. There's no fluidity to my pace, and there's this constriction
in my area of perception, so I'm just focused on internal systems. And I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower, and I could actually hear
the dialogue inside of my body. I heard a little voice saying, "OK.
You muscles, you've got to contract. You muscles, you relax." And then I lost my balance,
and I'm propped up against the wall. And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define
the boundaries of my body. I can't define where I begin
and where I end, because the atoms
and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms
and molecules of the wall. And all I could detect
was this energy -- energy. And I'm asking myself,
"What is wrong with me? What is going on?" And in that moment, my left hemisphere
brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control
and pushed the mute button. Total silence. And at first I was shocked to find myself
inside of a silent mind. But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence
of the energy around me. And because I could no longer
identify the boundaries of my body, I felt enormous and expansive. I felt at one with
all the energy that was, and it was beautiful there. Then all of a sudden
my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me,
"Hey! We've got a problem! We've got to get some help." And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!" (Laughter) So it's like, "OK, I've got a problem." But then I immediately drifted
right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately
refer to this space as La La Land. But it was beautiful there. Imagine what it would be like to be
totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you
to the external world. So here I am in this space, and my job, and any stress
related to my job -- it was gone. And I felt lighter in my body. And imagine all of the relationships
in the external world and any stressors related
to any of those -- they were gone. And I felt this sense of peacefulness. And imagine
what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage! (Laughter) Oh! I felt euphoria -- euphoria. It was beautiful. And again, my left hemisphere
comes online and it says, "Hey! You've got to pay attention. We've got to get help." And I'm thinking, "I've got to get help.
I've got to focus." So I get out of the shower
and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment, and I'm thinking,
"I've got to get to work. Can I drive?" And in that moment, my right arm went totally
paralyzed by my side. Then I realized, "Oh my gosh!
I'm having a stroke!" And the next thing my brain says to me is, Wow! This is so cool! (Laughter) This is so cool! How many brain scientists
have the opportunity to study their own brain
from the inside out?" (Laughter) And then it crosses my mind,
"But I'm a very busy woman!" (Laughter) "I don't have time for a stroke!" So I'm like, "OK, I can't stop
the stroke from happening, so I'll do this for a week or two,
and then I'll get back to my routine. OK. So I've got to call help.
I've got to call work." I couldn't remember the number at work, so I remembered, in my office
I had a business card with my number. So I go into my business room, I pull
out a three-inch stack of business cards. And I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly
in my mind's eye what my business card looked like, I couldn't tell if this
was my card or not, because all I could see were pixels. And the pixels of the words
blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols,
and I just couldn't tell. And then I would wait
for what I call a wave of clarity. And in that moment, I would be able
to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card...
that's not the card. It took me 45 minutes to get one inch
down inside of that stack of cards. In the meantime, for 45 minutes, the hemorrhage is getting bigger
in my left hemisphere. I do not understand numbers,
I do not understand the telephone, but it's the only plan I have. So I take the phone pad
and I put it right here. I take the business card,
I put it right here, and I'm matching the shape
of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles
on the phone pad. But then I would drift back out
into La La Land, and not remember when I came back
if I'd already dialed those numbers. So I had to wield
my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers
as I went along and pushed them, so that as I would come back
to normal reality, I'd be able to tell, "Yes,
I've already dialed that number." Eventually, the whole number gets dialed
and I'm listening to the phone, and my colleague picks up the phone
and he says to me, "Woo woo woo woo." (Laughter) (Laughter) And I think to myself, "Oh my gosh, he sounds
like a Golden Retriever!" (Laughter) And so I say to him --
clear in my mind, I say to him: "This is Jill! I need help!" And what comes out of my voice is,
"Woo woo woo woo woo." I'm thinking, "Oh my gosh,
I sound like a Golden Retriever." So I couldn't know -- I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand
language until I tried. So he recognizes that I need help
and he gets me help. And a little while later,
I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston
to [Massachusetts] General Hospital. And I curl up into a little fetal ball. And just like a balloon
with the last bit of air, just right out of the balloon, I just felt my energy lift
and just I felt my spirit surrender. And in that moment, I knew that I was
no longer the choreographer of my life. And either the doctors rescue my body
and give me a second chance at life, or this was perhaps
my moment of transition. When I woke later that afternoon, I was shocked to discover
that I was still alive. When I felt my spirit surrender,
I said goodbye to my life. And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite
planes of reality. Stimulation coming in
through my sensory systems felt like pure pain. Light burned my brain like wildfire, and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out
from the background noise, and I just wanted to escape. Because I could not identify the position
of my body in space, I felt enormous and expansive, like a genie just liberated
from her bottle. And my spirit soared free, like a great whale gliding
through the sea of silent euphoria. Nirvana. I found Nirvana. And I remember thinking, there's no way I would ever be able
to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body. But then I realized, "But I'm still alive! I'm still alive, and I have found Nirvana. And if I have found Nirvana
and I'm still alive, then everyone who is alive
can find Nirvana." And I pictured a world filled with beautiful, peaceful,
compassionate, loving people who knew that they could come
to this space at any time. And that they could purposely choose to step to the right
of their left hemispheres -- and find this peace. And then I realized what a tremendous gift
this experience could be, what a stroke of insight this could be
to how we live our lives. And it motivated me to recover. Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage,
the surgeons went in, and they removed a blood clot
the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers. Here I am with my mama, who is a true angel in my life. It took me eight years
to completely recover. So who are we? We are the life-force power
of the universe, with manual dexterity
and two cognitive minds. And we have the power
to choose, moment by moment, who and how we want to be in the world. Right here, right now, I can step into the consciousness
of my right hemisphere, where we are. I am the life-force power of the universe. I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful
molecular geniuses that make up my form, at one with all that is. Or, I can choose to step into
the consciousness of my left hemisphere, where I become
a single individual, a solid. Separate from the flow, separate from you. I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor: intellectual, neuroanatomist. These are the "we" inside of me. Which would you choose? Which do you choose? And when? I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep
inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project
into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be. And I thought that was an idea
worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother
who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder, schizophrenia. And as a sister and later, as a scientist, I wanted to understand,
why is it that I can take my dreams, I can connect them to my reality, and I can make my dreams come true? What is it about my brother's brain
and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams
to a common and shared reality, so they instead become delusion? So I dedicated my career to research
into the severe mental illnesses. And I moved from my home state
of Indiana to Boston, where I was working in the lab
of Dr. Francine Benes, in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry. And in the lab,
we were asking the question, "What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals
who would be diagnosed as normal control, as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia,
schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?" So we were essentially
mapping the microcircuitry of the brain: which cells are communicating
with which cells, with which chemicals, and then in what quantities
of those chemicals? So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing
this type of research during the day, but then in the evenings
and on the weekends, I traveled as an advocate for NAMI,
the National Alliance on Mental Illness. But on the morning of December 10, 1996, I woke up to discover that I had
a brain disorder of my own. A blood vessel exploded
in the left half of my brain. And in the course of four hours, I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information. On the morning of the hemorrhage, I could not walk, talk, read,
write or recall any of my life. I essentially became
an infant in a woman's body. If you've ever seen a human brain, it's obvious that the two hemispheres
are completely separate from one another. And I have brought for you
a real human brain. (Groaning, laughter) So this is a real human brain. This is the front of the brain, the back of brain
with the spinal cord hanging down, and this is how it would be
positioned inside of my head. And when you look at the brain, it's obvious that
the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another. For those of you who understand computers, our right hemisphere functions
like a parallel processor, while our left hemisphere functions
like a serial processor. The two hemispheres
do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum, which is made up of some
300 million axonal fibers. But other than that, the two hemispheres
are completely separate. Because they process
information differently, each of our hemispheres
think about different things, they care about different things,
and, dare I say, they have very different personalities. Excuse me. Thank you. It's been a joy. Assistant: It has been. (Laughter) Our right human hemisphere
is all about this present moment. It's all about "right here, right now." Our right hemisphere,
it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically
through the movement of our bodies. Information, in the form of energy,
streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes
into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like, what this present moment
smells like and tastes like, what it feels like

to the energy all around me through the consciousness
of my right hemisphere. We are energy-beings
connected to one another through the consciousness
of our right hemispheres as one human family. And right here, right now, we are brothers
and sisters on this planet, here to make the world a better place. And in this moment we are perfect,
we are whole and we are beautiful. My left hemisphere, our left hemisphere,
is a very different place. Our left hemisphere
thinks linearly and methodically. Our left hemisphere is all about the past
and it's all about the future. Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage
of the present moment and start picking out details,
and more details about those details. It then categorizes and organizes
all that information, associates it with everything
in the past we've ever learned, and projects into the future
all of our possibilities. And our left hemisphere

**Transcript**:
[Music] I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia and as a sister and later as a scientist I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams I can connect them to my reality and I can make my dreams come true what is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion so I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of dr. Francine Venice in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry and in the lab we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder so we were essentially mapping the micro circuitry of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals so there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for Nami the National Alliance on Mental Illness but on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a woman's body if you've ever seen a human brain it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another and I have brought for you a real human brain thank you sir so this is a real human brain this is the front of the brain the back of the brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head and when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers but other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate because they process information differently each of our hemisphere think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities excuse me thank you it's been a joy our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment it's all about right here right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place and in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different place our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details details and more details about those details it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities and our left hemisphere thinks in language it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me in my internal world to my external world it's that little voice that says to me hey you got to remember to pick up a Nana's on your way home I need them in the morning it's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it's a little voice that says to me I am I am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you and this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought okay I'll just start my normal routine so I got up and I jumped onto my cardia glider which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar and I thought that's very peculiar and I looked down at my body and I thought whoa I'm a weird-looking thing and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience there was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so I get off the machine and I'm walking across my living room floor and I realized that everything inside of my body has slowed way down and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there's no fluidity to my pace and there's this constriction in my area of perception so I'm just focused on internal systems and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying okay you muscles you got a contract and you muscles you relaxed and now I lost my balance propped up against the the wall and I look down at my arm and I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I can't define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall and all I could detect was this energy energy and I'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain shattered my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button total silence and at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there and then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we had a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help but I'm going oh I got a problem I got a problem so it's like okay okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and I fictionally refer to this space as lala land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to mice my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and I felt this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage oh I felt euphoria euphoria it was beautiful there and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and I'm thinking I've got to get help I gotta focus so I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment and I'm thinking I got to get to work I got to get to work can I Drive can I Drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side did I realize oh my gosh am I having a stroke I'm having a stroke and then the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out and then it crosses my mind but I'm a very busy woman time for a strong it's like okay I can't stop the stroke from happening so I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routine okay so I got a call help I got a call work I couldn't remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on him so I go into my business room I pull out a three inch stack of business cards and I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like I couldn't tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell and then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity and in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card that's not the card that's not the card it took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the mean time for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand a telephone but it's the only plan I have so I take the foam pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam pad but then I would drift back out into lala land and not remember if when I come back and if I'd already dialed those numbers so I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality I'd be able to tell yes I've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the song and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me whoa and I think that myself oh my gosh he sounds like a golden retriever and so I say to him clear in my mind I say to him this is Jill I need help and what comes out of my voice is I think oh my gosh I sound like a golden retriever so I couldn't know I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried so he recognizes that I need help and he and he gets me help and a little while later I'm I'm riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air of just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender and in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive when I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace and then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives and it motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my momma who's a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover so who are we we are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the life-force power of the universe I am the life-force power the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form and one with all that is or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate from you I am dr. Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist these are the wee inside of me which would you choose which do you choose and when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be and I thought that was an idea worth spreading [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia and as a sister and later as a scientist I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams I can connect them to my reality and I can make my dreams come true what is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion so I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of dr. Francine Venice in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry and in the lab we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder so we were essentially mapping the micro circuitry of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals so there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for Nami the National Alliance on Mental Illness but on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a woman's body if you've ever seen a human brain it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another and I have brought for you a real human brain thank you sir so this is a real human brain this is the front of the brain the back of the brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head and when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers but other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate because they process information differently each of our hemisphere think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities excuse me thank you it's been a joy our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment it's all about right here right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place and in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different place our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details details and more details about those details it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities and our left hemisphere thinks in language it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me in my internal world to my external world it's that little voice that says to me hey you got to remember to pick up a Nana's on your way home I need them in the morning it's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it's a little voice that says to me I am I am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you and this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought okay I'll just start my normal routine so I got up and I jumped onto my cardia glider which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar and I thought that's very peculiar and I looked down at my body and I thought whoa I'm a weird-looking thing and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience there was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so I get off the machine and I'm walking across my living room floor and I realized that everything inside of my body has slowed way down and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there's no fluidity to my pace and there's this constriction in my area of perception so I'm just focused on internal systems and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying okay you muscles you got a contract and you muscles you relaxed and now I lost my balance propped up against the the wall and I look down at my arm and I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I can't define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall and all I could detect was this energy energy and I'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain shattered my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button total silence and at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there and then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we had a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help but I'm going oh I got a problem I got a problem so it's like okay okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and I fictionally refer to this space as lala land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to mice my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and I felt this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage oh I felt euphoria euphoria it was beautiful there and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and I'm thinking I've got to get help I gotta focus so I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment and I'm thinking I got to get to work I got to get to work can I Drive can I Drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side did I realize oh my gosh am I having a stroke I'm having a stroke and then the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out and then it crosses my mind but I'm a very busy woman time for a strong it's like okay I can't stop the stroke from happening so I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routine okay so I got a call help I got a call work I couldn't remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on him so I go into my business room I pull out a three inch stack of business cards and I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like I couldn't tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell and then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity and in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card that's not the card that's not the card it took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the mean time for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand a telephone but it's the only plan I have so I take the foam pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam pad but then I would drift back out into lala land and not remember if when I come back and if I'd already dialed those numbers so I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality I'd be able to tell yes I've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the song and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me whoa and I think that myself oh my gosh he sounds like a golden retriever and so I say to him clear in my mind I say to him this is Jill I need help and what comes out of my voice is I think oh my gosh I sound like a golden retriever so I couldn't know I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried so he recognizes that I need help and he and he gets me help and a little while later I'm I'm riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air of just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender and in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive when I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace and then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives and it motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my momma who's a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover so who are we we are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the life-force power of the universe I am the life-force power the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form and one with all that is or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate from you I am dr. Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist these are the wee inside of me which would you choose which do you choose and when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be and I thought that was an idea worth spreading [Applause]

**Transcript**:
[Music] I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder schizophrenia and as a sister and later as a scientist I wanted to understand why is it that I can take my dreams I can connect them to my reality and I can make my dreams come true what is it about my brother's brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality so they instead become delusion so I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses and I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston where I was working in the lab of dr. Francine Venice in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry and in the lab we were asking the question what are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia schizoaffective or bipolar disorder so we were essentially mapping the micro circuitry of the brain which cells are communicating with which cells with which chemicals and then in what quantities of those chemicals so there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day but then in the evenings and and on the weekends I traveled as an advocate for Nami the National Alliance on Mental Illness but on the morning of December 10 1996 I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own a blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain and in the course of four hours I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information on the morning of the hemorrhage I could not walk talk read write or recall any of my life I essentially became an infant in a woman's body if you've ever seen a human brain it's obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another and I have brought for you a real human brain thank you sir so this is a real human brain this is the front of the brain the back of the brain with the spinal cord hanging down and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head and when you look at the brain it's obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another for those of you who understand computers our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor the two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus callosum which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers but other than that the two hemispheres are completely separate because they process information differently each of our hemisphere think about different things they care about different things and dare I say they have very different personalities excuse me thank you it's been a joy our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment it's all about right here right now our right hemisphere it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies information in the form of energy streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like what this present moment smells like and tastes like what it feels like and what it sounds like I am an energy being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere we are energy beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family and right here right now we are brothers and sisters on this planet here to make the world a better place and in this moment we are perfect we are whole and we are beautiful my left hemisphere our left hemisphere is a very different place our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically our left hemisphere is all about the past and it's all about the future our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details details and more details about those details it then categorizes and organizes all that information associates it with everything in the past we've ever learned and projects into the future all of our possibilities and our left hemisphere thinks in language it's that ongoing brain chatter that connects me in my internal world to my external world it's that little voice that says to me hey you got to remember to pick up a Nana's on your way home I need them in the morning it's that calculating intelligence that knows that reminds me when I have to do my laundry but perhaps most important it's a little voice that says to me I am I am and as soon as my left hemisphere says to me I am I become separate I become a single solid individual separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you and this is a portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke on the morning of the stroke I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye and it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream and it just gripped me and then it released me and then it just gripped me and then it released me and it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain so I thought okay I'll just start my normal routine so I got up and I jumped onto my cardia glider which is a full body full exercise machine and I'm jamming away on this thing and I'm realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar and I thought that's very peculiar and I looked down at my body and I thought whoa I'm a weird-looking thing and it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality where I'm the person on the machine having the experience to some esoteric space where I'm witnessing myself having this experience there was all very peculiar and my headache was just getting worse so I get off the machine and I'm walking across my living room floor and I realized that everything inside of my body has slowed way down and every step is very rigid and very deliberate there's no fluidity to my pace and there's this constriction in my area of perception so I'm just focused on internal systems and I'm standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body I heard a little voice saying okay you muscles you got a contract and you muscles you relaxed and now I lost my balance propped up against the the wall and I look down at my arm and I realized that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body I can't define where I begin and where I end because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall and all I could detect was this energy energy and I'm asking myself what is wrong with me what is going on and in that moment my brain shattered my left hemisphere brain chatter went totally silent just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button total silence and at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind but then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me and because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body I felt enormous and expansive I felt at one with all the energy that was and it was beautiful there and then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me hey we had a problem we got a problem we gotta get some help but I'm going oh I got a problem I got a problem so it's like okay okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness and I fictionally refer to this space as lala land but it was beautiful there imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world so here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to mice my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body and imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those they were gone and I felt this sense of peacefulness and imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage oh I felt euphoria euphoria it was beautiful there and then again my left hemisphere comes online and it says hey you've got to pay attention we've got to get help and I'm thinking I've got to get help I gotta focus so I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I'm walking around my apartment and I'm thinking I got to get to work I got to get to work can I Drive can I Drive and in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side did I realize oh my gosh am I having a stroke I'm having a stroke and then the next thing my brain says to me is wow this is so cool this is so cool how many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out and then it crosses my mind but I'm a very busy woman time for a strong it's like okay I can't stop the stroke from happening so I'll do this for a week or two and then I'll get back to my routine okay so I got a call help I got a call work I couldn't remember the number at work so I remembered in my office I had a business card with my number on him so I go into my business room I pull out a three inch stack of business cards and I'm looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind's eye what my business card looked like I couldn't tell if this was my card or not because all I could see were pixels and the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols and I just couldn't tell and then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity and in that moment I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that's not the card that's not the card that's not the card it took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards in the mean time for 45 minutes the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere I do not understand numbers I do not understand a telephone but it's the only plan I have so I take the foam pad and I put it right here I take the business card I put it right here and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the foam pad but then I would drift back out into lala land and not remember if when I come back and if I'd already dialed those numbers so I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them so that as I would come back to normal reality I'd be able to tell yes I've already dialed that number eventually the whole number gets dialed and I'm listening to the song and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me whoa and I think that myself oh my gosh he sounds like a golden retriever and so I say to him clear in my mind I say to him this is Jill I need help and what comes out of my voice is I think oh my gosh I sound like a golden retriever so I couldn't know I didn't know that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried so he recognizes that I need help and he and he gets me help and a little while later I'm I'm riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to Mass General Hospital and I curl up into a little fetal ball and just like a balloon with the last last bit of air of just just right out of the balloon I just felt my energy lift and just I felt my spirit surrender and in that moment I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life and either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life or this was perhaps my moment of transition when I woke later that afternoon I was shocked to discover that I was still alive when I felt my spirit surrender I said goodbye to my life and my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain light burned my brain like wildfire and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise and I just wanted to escape because I could not identify the position of my body in space I felt enormous and expansive like a genie just liberated from her bottle and my spirit soared free like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria nirvana I found nirvana I remember thinking there's no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body but then I realized but I'm still alive I'm still alive and I have found nirvana and and if I have found Nirvana and I'm still alive then everyone who is alive can find nirvana and I pictured a world filled with beautiful peaceful compassionate loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time and that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace and then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be what what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives and it motivated me to recover two-and-a-half weeks after the hemorrhage the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers Here I am with my momma who's a true angel in my life it took me eight years to completely recover so who are we we are the life force power of the universe with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds and we have the power to choose moment by moment who and how we want to be in the world right here right now I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere where we are I am the life-force power of the universe I am the life-force power the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form and one with all that is or I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere where I become a single individual a solid separate from the flow separate from you I am dr. Jill Bolte Taylor intellectual neuroanatomist these are the wee inside of me which would you choose which do you choose and when I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres the more peace we will project into the world and the more peaceful our planet will be and I thought that was an idea worth spreading [Applause]

**Transcript**:
When you think of 
Archimedes' "Eureka!" moment, you probably think of this. As it turns out, it may 
have been more like this. In the third century BC, Hieron,
king of the Sicilian city of Syracuse, chose Archimedes to supervise an engineering project 
of unprecedented scale. Hieron commissioned a sailing vessel 50 times bigger than a standard
ancient warship, named the Syracusia after his city. Hieron wanted to construct
the largest ship ever, which was destined 
to be given as a present for Egypt's ruler, Ptolemy. But could a boat the size
of a palace possibly float? In Archimedes's day, 
no one had attempted anything like this. It was like asking, "Can a mountain fly?" King Hieron had a lot 
riding on that question. Hundreds of workmen were to labor
for years on constructing the Syracusia out of beams of pine 
and fir from Mount Etna, ropes from hemp grown in Spain, and pitch from France. The top deck, on which 
eight watchtowers were to stand, was to be supported not by columns, but by vast wooden images of Atlas
holding the world on his shoulders. On the ship's bow, a massive catapult would be able 
to fire 180 pound stone missiles. For the enjoyment of its passengers, the ship was to feature 
a flower-lined promenade, a sheltered swimming pool, and bathhouse with heated water, a library filled with books and statues, a temple to the goddess Aphrodite, and a gymnasium. And just to make things 
more difficult for Archimedes, Hieron intended to pack 
the vessel full of cargo: 400 tons of grain, 10,000 jars of pickled fish, 74 tons of drinking water, and 600 tons of wool. It would have carried well over
a thousand people on board, including 600 soldiers. And it housed 20 horses 
in separate stalls. To build something of this scale, only for that to sink 
on its maiden voyage? Well, let's just say that failure wouldn't have been a pleasant 
option for Archimedes. So he took on the problem: will it sink? Perhaps he was sitting 
in the bathhouse one day, wondering how a heavy bathtub can float, when inspiration came to him. An object partially immersed in a fluid
is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid
displaced by the object. In other words, if a 2,000 ton Syracusia
displaced exactly 2,000 tons of water, it would just barely float. If it displaced 4,000 tons of water,
it would float with no problem. Of course, if it only displaced 
1,000 tons of water, well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy. This is the law of buoyancy, and engineers still 
call it Archimedes' Principle. It explains why a steel supertanker
can float as easily as a wooden rowboat or a bathtub. If the weight of water displaced
by the vessel below the keel is equivalent to the vessel's weight, whatever is above the keel
will remain afloat above the waterline. This sounds a lot like another story
involving Archimedes and a bathtub, and it's possible that's because
they're actually the same story, twisted by the vagaries of history. The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka!
and subsequent streak through the streets centers around a crown, 
or corona in Latin. At the core of the Syracusia story
is a keel, or korone in Greek. Could one have been 
mixed up for the other? We may never know. On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt
on its first and only voyage, we can only imagine how residents
of Alexandria thronged the harbor to marvel at the arrival 
of this majestic, floating castle. This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic
of the ancient world, except without the sinking,
thanks to our pal, Archimedes.

riding on that question. Hundreds of workmen were to labor
for years on constructing the Syracusia out of beams of pine 
and fir from Mount Etna, ropes from hemp grown in Spain, and pitch from France. The top deck, on which 
eight watchtowers were to stand, was to be supported not by columns, but by vast wooden images of Atlas
holding the world on his shoulders. On the ship's bow, a massive catapult would be able 
to fire 180 pound stone missiles. For the enjoyment of its passengers, the ship was to feature 
a flower-lined promenade, a sheltered swimming pool, and bathhouse with heated water, a library filled with books and statues, a temple to the goddess Aphrodite, and a gymnasium. And just to make things 
more difficult for Archimedes, Hieron intended to pack 
the vessel full of cargo: 400 tons of grain, 10,000 jars of pickled fish, 74 tons of drinking water, and 600 tons of wool. It would have carried well over
a thousand people on board, including 600 soldiers. And it housed 20 horses

1,000 tons of water, well, Hieron wouldn't be too happy. This is the law of buoyancy, and engineers still 
call it Archimedes' Principle. It explains why a steel supertanker
can float as easily as a wooden rowboat or a bathtub. If the weight of water displaced
by the vessel below the keel is equivalent to the vessel's weight, whatever is above the keel
will remain afloat above the waterline. This sounds a lot like another story
involving Archimedes and a bathtub, and it's possible that's because
they're actually the same story, twisted by the vagaries of history. The classical story of Archimedes' Eureka!
and subsequent streak through the streets centers around a crown, 
or corona in Latin. At the core of the Syracusia story
is a keel, or korone in Greek. Could one have been 
mixed up for the other? We may never know. On the day the Syracusia arrived in Egypt
on its first and only voyage, we can only imagine how residents
of Alexandria thronged the harbor to marvel at the arrival 
of this majestic, floating castle. This extraordinary vessel was the Titanic
of the ancient world, except without the sinking,
thanks to our pal, Archimedes.

**Transcript**:
For most of human history, medical workers sought 
to treat diseases or cure them. The rise of vaccination 
in the 19th century enhanced the potential to prevent people from contracting illnesses
in the first place. But only in recent decades did it 
become possible to ensure that a particular disease
never threatens humanity again. The story of smallpox, the first and, so far, the only disease to be permanently 
eradicated from the world, shows how disease eradication can happen
and why it is so difficult to achieve. Smallpox emerged in human populations
thousands of years ago as a contagious virus that spread rapidly, primarily through close, 
face to face contact, causing fever, aches and rashes. It killed up to 30% of its victims and often left survivors with life-long
disfiguring scars. The devastating impact 
of smallpox was so great that several cultures had religious 
deities specifically dedicated to it. In the 20th century alone, it is estimated to have killed
more than 300 million people worldwide. With the effective 
deployment of vaccination, the number of cases began to decrease. By seeking out infected individuals, isolating them, and vaccinating their contacts 
to prevent further transmission, scientists realized that the spread
of the disease could be haulted. In fact, because smallpox could
only survive in human hosts, vaccinating all of an infected persons'
potential contacts would stop the virus dead in its tracks and eliminate it from that region. Once this strategy had succeeded in ridding most industrialized countries
from disease, health officials realized that eradicating
it worldwide was within reach. But this was not an easy process, proving especially difficult in places
suffering from poor infrastructure or civil wars. The eradication effort took decades and involved millions 
of people working together, from world leaders
and international organizations to rural doctors and community workers. In India, one of the last 
strongholds of the disease, health workers visited every one
of the country's 100 million households to search for cases. Through this unprecedented 
worldwide effort, in which even rival 
superpowers cooperated, smallpox was finally 
declared eradicated in 1980, saving approximately 40 million lives
over the following two decades. There were several factors that made smallpox
an ideal candidate for eradication. First, humans are essential
to the smallpox lifecycle, so breaking the chain 
of human to human transmission causes the virus to die out. In contrast, many other pathogens,
like ebola or the bubonic plague, can survive in animal carriers, while the bacteria that cause tetanus
can even live in the soil. Secondly, individuals 
infected with smallpox displayed a characteristic rash,
making them easy to identify, even without a lab test. The lack of such practical 
diagnostic tools for diseases with non-specific symptoms,
or that have long incubation periods, such as AIDS,
makes their eradication more difficult. Third, the availability 
of a smallpox vaccine that provided immunity 
for five to ten years in a single dose meant that there was 
an effective intervention to stop the virus from spreading. And finally, the initial success
of several countries in eliminating the disease 
within their borders served as a proof of principle
for its eradication worldwide. Today, the same criteria 
are applied to determine whether other diseases 
can be similarly eliminated. And even though smallpox remains
the only success story thus far, several other pathogens 
may be next in line. Great progress has been made
towards eradicating guinea worm disease simply by use of water filters. And vaccination for polio, which previously disabled hundreds
of thousands of people each year is estimated to have prevented 13 million
cases of paralysis, and 650,000 deaths since 1988. With a 99% drop in infections
since the eradication effort began, one final push is all that is needed to ensure that polio 
will never paralyze another child. Disease eradication is one public health
effort that benefits all of humanity and challenges us to work together
as a global community. Beyond eliminating specific diseases, eradication programs benefit 
local populations by improving health infrastructure. For example, Nigeria recently 
used facilities and personnel from their polio eradication program
to effectively control an ebola outbreak. Further more, globalization 
and international travel means that even a single infection
anywhere in the world can potentially spread to other regions. By helping to protect others,
we help to protect ourselves. Disease eradication is the ultimate gift
we can give to everyone alive today, as well as all future 
generations of humanity.

**Transcript**:
For most of human history, medical workers sought 
to treat diseases or cure them. The rise of vaccination 
in the 19th century enhanced the potential to prevent people from contracting illnesses
in the first place. But only in recent decades did it 
become possible to ensure that a particular disease
never threatens humanity again. The story of smallpox, the first and, so far, the only disease to be permanently 
eradicated from the world, shows how disease eradication can happen
and why it is so difficult to achieve. Smallpox emerged in human populations
thousands of years ago as a contagious virus that spread rapidly, primarily through close, 
face to face contact, causing fever, aches and rashes. It killed up to 30% of its victims and often left survivors with life-long
disfiguring scars. The devastating impact 
of smallpox was so great that several cultures had religious 
deities specifically dedicated to it. In the 20th century alone, it is estimated to have killed
more than 300 million people worldwide. With the effective 
deployment of vaccination, the number of cases began to decrease. By seeking out infected individuals, isolating them, and vaccinating their contacts 
to prevent further transmission, scientists realized that the spread
of the disease could be haulted. In fact, because smallpox could
only survive in human hosts, vaccinating all of an infected persons'
potential contacts would stop the virus dead in its tracks and eliminate it from that region. Once this strategy had succeeded in ridding most industrialized countries
from disease, health officials realized that eradicating
it worldwide was within reach. But this was not an easy process, proving especially difficult in places
suffering from poor infrastructure or civil wars. The eradication effort took decades and involved millions 
of people working together, from world leaders
and international organizations to rural doctors and community workers. In India, one of the last 
strongholds of the disease, health workers visited every one
of the country's 100 million households to search for cases. Through this unprecedented 
worldwide effort, in which even rival 
superpowers cooperated, smallpox was finally 
declared eradicated in 1980, saving approximately 40 million lives
over the following two decades. There were several factors that made smallpox
an ideal candidate for eradication. First, humans are essential
to the smallpox lifecycle, so breaking the chain 
of human to human transmission causes the virus to die out. In contrast, many other pathogens,
like ebola or the bubonic plague, can survive in animal carriers, while the bacteria that cause tetanus
can even live in the soil. Secondly, individuals 
infected with smallpox displayed a characteristic rash,
making them easy to identify, even without a lab test. The lack of such practical 
diagnostic tools for diseases with non-specific symptoms,
or that have long incubation periods, such as AIDS,
makes their eradication more difficult. Third, the availability 
of a smallpox vaccine that provided immunity 
for five to ten years in a single dose meant that there was 
an effective intervention to stop the virus from spreading. And finally, the initial success
of several countries in eliminating the disease 
within their borders served as a proof of principle
for its eradication worldwide. Today, the same criteria 
are applied to determine whether other diseases 
can be similarly eliminated. And even though smallpox remains
the only success story thus far, several other pathogens 
may be next in line. Great progress has been made
towards eradicating guinea worm disease simply by use of water filters. And vaccination for polio, which previously disabled hundreds
of thousands of people each year is estimated to have prevented 13 million
cases of paralysis, and 650,000 deaths since 1988. With a 99% drop in infections
since the eradication effort began, one final push is all that is needed to ensure that polio 
will never paralyze another child. Disease eradication is one public health
effort that benefits all of humanity and challenges us to work together
as a global community. Beyond eliminating specific diseases, eradication programs benefit 
local populations by improving health infrastructure. For example, Nigeria recently 
used facilities and personnel from their polio eradication program
to effectively control an ebola outbreak. Further more, globalization 
and international travel means that even a single infection
anywhere in the world can potentially spread to other regions. By helping to protect others,
we help to protect ourselves. Disease eradication is the ultimate gift
we can give to everyone alive today, as well as all future 
generations of humanity.

**Transcript**:
Which of these entities 
has evolved the ability to manipulate an animal
many times its size? The answer is all of them. These are all parasites, organisms that live on 
or inside another host organism, which they harm and sometimes even kill. Parasite survival depends on transmitting
from one host to the next, sometimes through 
an intermediate species. Our parasites elegantly achieve this
by manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,
but the cricket prefers dry land. So once it's big enough to reproduce, the worm produces proteins that garble
the cricket's navigational system. The confused cricket 
jumps around erratically, moves closer to water, and eventually leaps in,
often drowning in the process. The worm then wriggles out to mate and its eggs get eaten 
by little water insects that mature, colonize land, and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets. And thus, the Gordian worm lives on. And here's the rabies virus,
another mind-altering parasite. This virus infects mammals, often dogs, and travels up the animal's 
nerves to its brain where it causes inflammation 
that eventually kills the host. But before it does, it often increases
its host's aggressiveness and ramps up the production
of rabies-transmitting saliva, while making it hard to swallow. These factors make the host 
more likely to bite another animal and more likely to pass 
the virus on when it does. And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,
also known as the zombie fungus. Its host of choice is tropical ants
that normally live in treetops. After Ophiocordyceps spores 
pierce the ant's exoskeleton, they set off convulsions 
that make the ant fall from the tree. The fungus changes the ant's behavior,
compelling it to wander mindlessly until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with
the perfect fungal breeding conditions, which it latches onto. The ant then dies, and the fungus parasitizes its body
to build a tall, thin stalk from its neck. Within several weeks, 
the stalk shoots off spores, which turn more ants 
into six-legged leaf-seeking zombies. One of humanity's most deadly assailants
is a behavior-altering parasite, though if it's any consolation, it's not our brains 
that are being hijacked. I'm talking about Plasmodium,
which causes malaria. This parasite needs mosquitoes
to shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently
and for longer. There's also evidence 
that humans infected with malaria are more attractive to mosquitoes, which will bite them 
and transfer the parasite further. This multi-species system is so effective, that there are hundreds of millions
of malaria cases every year. And finally, there are cats. Don't worry, there probably 
aren't any cats living in your body and controlling your thoughts. I mean, probably. But there is a microorganism
called Toxoplasma that needs both cats and rodents
to complete its life cycle. When a rat gets infected
by eating cat feces, the parasite changes chemical levels
in the rat's brain, making it less cautious
around the hungry felines, maybe even attracted to them. This makes them easy prey, so these infected rodents
get eaten and pass the parasite on. Mind control successful. There's even evidence that the parasite
affects human behavior. In most cases, 
we don't completely understand how these parasites manage 
their feats of behavior modification. But from what we do know, we can tell that they have 
a pretty diverse toolbox. Gordian worms seem to affect
crickets' brains directly. The malaria parasite, on the other hand, blocks an enzyme 
that helps the mosquitoes feed, forcing them to bite over 
and over and over again. The rabies virus may cause 
that snarling, slobbering behavior by putting the immune system
into overdrive. But whatever the method, when you think about how effectively these parasites control 
the behavior of their hosts, you may wonder how much of human behavior
is actually parasites doing the talking. Since more than half of the species
on Earth are parasites, it could be more than we think.

by manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,
but the cricket prefers dry land. So once it's big enough to reproduce, the worm produces proteins that garble
the cricket's navigational system. The confused cricket 
jumps around erratically, moves closer to water, and eventually leaps in,
often drowning in the process. The worm then wriggles out to mate and its eggs get eaten 
by little water insects that mature, colonize land, and are, in turn, eaten by new crickets. And thus, the Gordian worm lives on. And here's the rabies virus,
another mind-altering parasite. This virus infects mammals, often dogs, and travels up the animal's 
nerves to its brain where it causes inflammation 
that eventually kills the host. But before it does, it often increases
its host's aggressiveness and ramps up the production
of rabies-transmitting saliva, while making it hard to swallow. These factors make the host 
more likely to bite another animal and more likely to pass 
the virus on when it does. And now, meet Ophiocordyceps,
also known as the zombie fungus. Its host of choice is tropical ants
that normally live in treetops. After Ophiocordyceps spores 
pierce the ant's exoskeleton, they set off convulsions 
that make the ant fall from the tree. The fungus changes the ant's behavior,
compelling it to wander mindlessly until it stumbles onto a plant leaf with
the perfect fungal breeding conditions, which it latches onto. The ant then dies, and the fungus parasitizes its body
to build a tall, thin stalk from its neck. Within several weeks, 
the stalk shoots off spores, which turn more ants 
into six-legged leaf-seeking zombies. One of humanity's most deadly assailants
is a behavior-altering parasite, though if it's any consolation, it's not our brains 
that are being hijacked. I'm talking about Plasmodium,
which causes malaria. This parasite needs mosquitoes
to shuttle it between hosts, so it makes them bite more frequently
and for longer. There's also evidence 
that humans infected with malaria are more attractive to mosquitoes, which will bite them 
and transfer the parasite further. This multi-species system is so effective, that there are hundreds of millions
of malaria cases every year. And finally, there are cats. Don't worry, there probably 
aren't any cats living in your body and controlling your thoughts. I mean, probably. But there is a microorganism
called Toxoplasma that needs both cats and rodents
to complete its life cycle. When a rat gets infected
by eating cat feces, the parasite changes chemical levels
in the rat's brain, making it less cautious
around the hungry felines, maybe even attracted to them. This makes them easy prey, so these infected rodents
get eaten and pass the parasite on. Mind control successful. There's even evidence that the parasite
affects human behavior. In most cases, 
we don't completely understand how these parasites manage 
their feats of behavior modification. But from what we do know, we can tell that they have 
a pretty diverse toolbox. Gordian worms seem to affect
crickets' brains directly. The malaria parasite, on the other hand, blocks an enzyme 
that helps the mosquitoes feed, forcing them to bite over 
and over and over again. The rabies virus may cause 
that snarling, slobbering behavior by putting the immune system
into overdrive. But whatever the method, when you think about how effectively these parasites control 
the behavior of their hosts, you may wonder how much of human behavior
is actually parasites doing the talking. Since more than half of the species
on Earth are parasites, it could be more than we think.

Which of these entities 
has evolved the ability to manipulate an animal
many times its size? The answer is all of them. These are all parasites, organisms that live on 
or inside another host organism, which they harm and sometimes even kill. Parasite survival depends on transmitting
from one host to the next, sometimes through 
an intermediate species. Our parasites elegantly achieve this
by manipulating their host's behavior, sometimes through direct brain hijacking. For example, this is the Gordian worm. One of its hosts, this cricket. The Gordian worm needs water to mate,

Many modern musical instruments
are cumbersome or have a lot of parts. Some need a stand or a stool. But the cajon is a drum, a stand
and a seat all in one convenient box. And this simplicity may be key to its
journey across continents and cultures to become one of the most popular 
percussion instruments in the world today. The cajon's story begins in West Africa, whose Indigenousness people
had rich musical traditions centered on drumming and dancing. When many of them were captured
and brought to the Americas as slaves, they brought this culture with them, but without their native instruments,
they had to improvise. African slaves in coastal Peru
didn't have the materials or the opportunity to craft 
one of their traditional drums such as a djembe or a djun djun. But what they did have 
were plenty of shipping crates. Not only were these readily accessible, but their inconspicuous appearance may have helped get around laws 
prohibiting slaves from playing music. Early Peruvian cajons 
consisted of a simple box with five thick wooden sides. The sixth side, made of 
a thinner sheet of wood, would be used as the striking surface, or more commonly known as the tapa. A sound hole was also cut into the back
to allow the sound to escape. As an Afro-Peruvian culture developed, and new forms of music and dance,
such as Zamacueca, Festejo and Landó were born, the cajon became a dedicated musical
instrument in its own right. Early modifications involved simply
bending the planks of the box to tweak the sound, and when abolition of slavery introduced
the cajon to a broader population, more improvisation 
and experimentation soon followed. Perhaps the person most responsible 
for introducing the cajon to European audiences was Spanish 
Flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía. When touring in Peru in 1977, he and his percussionist Rubem Dantas discovered the cajon 
and brought it back to Spain, recognizing its potential 
for use in Flamenco music. By stretching guitar strings 
along the inside of the tapa, the flamenco musicians were able to create
a buzz-like snare sound. Combined with the regular base tone, this gave the cajon a sound 
close to a basic drum set. The cajon quickly caught on, not only becoming standard in Flamenco, but being used in genres like folk,
jazz, blues, and rock. Today, many specialized cajons 
are manufactured, some with adjustable strings, some with multiple playing surfaces, and some with a snare mechansim. But the basic concept remains the same, and the story of the cajon shows that the simplest things 
can have the most amazing potential when you think outside and inside the box.

**Transcript**:
Many modern musical instruments
are cumbersome or have a lot of parts. Some need a stand or a stool. But the cajon is a drum, a stand
and a seat all in one convenient box. And this simplicity may be key to its
journey across continents and cultures to become one of the most popular 
percussion instruments in the world today. The cajon's story begins in West Africa, whose Indigenousness people
had rich musical traditions centered on drumming and dancing. When many of them were captured
and brought to the Americas as slaves, they brought this culture with them, but without their native instruments,
they had to improvise. African slaves in coastal Peru
didn't have the materials or the opportunity to craft 
one of their traditional drums such as a djembe or a djun djun. But what they did have 
were plenty of shipping crates. Not only were these readily accessible, but their inconspicuous appearance may have helped get around laws 
prohibiting slaves from playing music. Early Peruvian cajons 
consisted of a simple box with five thick wooden sides. The sixth side, made of 
a thinner sheet of wood, would be used as the striking surface, or more commonly known as the tapa. A sound hole was also cut into the back
to allow the sound to escape. As an Afro-Peruvian culture developed, and new forms of music and dance,
such as Zamacueca, Festejo and Landó were born, the cajon became a dedicated musical
instrument in its own right. Early modifications involved simply
bending the planks of the box to tweak the sound, and when abolition of slavery introduced
the cajon to a broader population, more improvisation 
and experimentation soon followed. Perhaps the person most responsible 
for introducing the cajon to European audiences was Spanish 
Flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucía. When touring in Peru in 1977, he and his percussionist Rubem Dantas discovered the cajon 
and brought it back to Spain, recognizing its potential 
for use in Flamenco music. By stretching guitar strings 
along the inside of the tapa, the flamenco musicians were able to create
a buzz-like snare sound. Combined with the regular base tone, this gave the cajon a sound 
close to a basic drum set. The cajon quickly caught on, not only becoming standard in Flamenco, but being used in genres like folk,
jazz, blues, and rock. Today, many specialized cajons 
are manufactured, some with adjustable strings, some with multiple playing surfaces, and some with a snare mechansim. But the basic concept remains the same, and the story of the cajon shows that the simplest things 
can have the most amazing potential when you think outside and inside the box.

**Transcript**:
What if you could absorb
another organism and take on its abilities? Imagine you swallowed a small bird
and suddenly gained the ability to fly. Or if you engulfed a cobra and were then able to spit poisonous venom
from your teeth. Throughout the history of life, specifically during the evolution 
of complex eukaryotic cells, things like this happened all the time. One organism absorbed another, and they united to become a new organism
with the combined abilities of both. We think that around 2 billion years ago, the only living organisms on Earth
were prokaryotes, single-celled organisms 
lacking membrane-bound organelles. Let's look closely at just three of them. One was a big, simple blob-like cell with the ability to absorb things 
by wrapping its cell membrane around them. Another was a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar
molecules through photosynthesis. A third used oxygen gas to break down
materials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful
for life activities. The blob cells would occasionally absorb
the little photosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria then lived inside the blob
and divided like they always had, but their existence became linked. If you stumbled upon 
this living arrangement, you might just think that the whole thing
was one organism, that the green photosynthetic bacteria
were just a part of the blob that performed one of its life functions, just like your heart is a part of you that performs the function 
of pumping your blood. This process of cells living together
is called endosymbiosis, one organism living inside another. But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there. What would happen
if the other bacteria moved in, too? Now the cells of this species started
becoming highly complex. They were big and full 
of intricate structures that we call chloroplasts 
and mitochondria. These structures work together 
to harness sunlight, make sugar, and break down that sugar using the oxygen that right around this time started 
to appear in the Earth's atmosphere. Organisms absorbing other organisms was one way species adapted
to the changing environmental conditions of their surroundings. This little story highlights what 
biologists call the endosymbiotic theory, the current best explanation
of how complex cells evolved. There's a lot of evidence 
that supports this theory, but let's look at three main pieces. First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria
in our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, which are still around, by the way. In fact, if you destroy these structures
in a cell, no new ones will appear. The cell can't make them. They can only make more of themselves. Second piece of evidence. Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain
their own DNA and ribosomes. Their DNA has a circular structure that is strikingly similar to the DNA
of the ancient bacteria, and it also contains many similar genes. The ribosomes, or protein assembly 
machines of chloroplasts and mitochondria, also have the same structure as ribosomes
of ancient bacteria, but are different from the ribosomes hanging around
the rest of eukaryotic cell. Lastly, think about the membranes involved
in the engulfing process. Chloroplasts and mitochondria
both have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. Their inner membrane contains 
some particular lipids and proteins that are not present 
in the outer membrane. Why is that significant? Because their outer membrane
used to belong to the blob cell. When they were engulfed
in the endosymbiosis process, they got wrapped up in that membrane
and kept their own as their inner one. Surely enough, those same lipids and proteins are found on the membranes
of the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast 
variety of eukaryotic organisms. Take the green algae that grow on 
the walls of swimming pools. A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning 
tail structures, or flagella, at some point absorbed algae like these
to form what we now call euglena. Euglena can perform photosynthesis, break down sugar using oxygen, and swim around pond water. And as the theory would predict, the chloroplasts in these euglena
have three membranes since they had two before being engulfed. The absorbing process
of endosymbiotic theory allowed organisms to combine 
powerful abilities to become better adapted to life on Earth. The results were species 
capable of much more than when they were separate organisms, and this was an evolutionary leap that lead to the microorganisms, plants, and animals we observe 
on the planet today.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What if you could absorb
another organism and take on its abilities? Imagine you swallowed a small bird
and suddenly gained the ability to fly. Or if you engulfed a cobra and were then able to spit poisonous venom
from your teeth. Throughout the history of life, specifically during the evolution 
of complex eukaryotic cells, things like this happened all the time. One organism absorbed another, and they united to become a new organism
with the combined abilities of both. We think that around 2 billion years ago, the only living organisms on Earth
were prokaryotes, single-celled organisms 
lacking membrane-bound organelles. Let's look closely at just three of them. One was a big, simple blob-like cell with the ability to absorb things 
by wrapping its cell membrane around them. Another was a bacterial cell that converted solar energy into sugar
molecules through photosynthesis. A third used oxygen gas to break down
materials like sugar and release its energy into a form useful
for life activities. The blob cells would occasionally absorb
the little photosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria then lived inside the blob
and divided like they always had, but their existence became linked. If you stumbled upon 
this living arrangement, you might just think that the whole thing
was one organism, that the green photosynthetic bacteria
were just a part of the blob that performed one of its life functions, just like your heart is a part of you that performs the function 
of pumping your blood. This process of cells living together
is called endosymbiosis, one organism living inside another. But the endosymbiosis didn't stop there. What would happen
if the other bacteria moved in, too? Now the cells of this species started
becoming highly complex. They were big and full 
of intricate structures that we call chloroplasts 
and mitochondria. These structures work together 
to harness sunlight, make sugar, and break down that sugar using the oxygen that right around this time started 
to appear in the Earth's atmosphere. Organisms absorbing other organisms was one way species adapted
to the changing environmental conditions of their surroundings. This little story highlights what 
biologists call the endosymbiotic theory, the current best explanation
of how complex cells evolved. There's a lot of evidence 
that supports this theory, but let's look at three main pieces. First, the chloroplasts and mitochondria
in our cells multiply the very same way as those ancient bacteria, which are still around, by the way. In fact, if you destroy these structures
in a cell, no new ones will appear. The cell can't make them. They can only make more of themselves. Second piece of evidence. Chloroplasts and mitochondria both contain
their own DNA and ribosomes. Their DNA has a circular structure that is strikingly similar to the DNA
of the ancient bacteria, and it also contains many similar genes. The ribosomes, or protein assembly 
machines of chloroplasts and mitochondria, also have the same structure as ribosomes
of ancient bacteria, but are different from the ribosomes hanging around
the rest of eukaryotic cell. Lastly, think about the membranes involved
in the engulfing process. Chloroplasts and mitochondria
both have two membranes surrounding them, an inner and outer membrane. Their inner membrane contains 
some particular lipids and proteins that are not present 
in the outer membrane. Why is that significant? Because their outer membrane
used to belong to the blob cell. When they were engulfed
in the endosymbiosis process, they got wrapped up in that membrane
and kept their own as their inner one. Surely enough, those same lipids and proteins are found on the membranes
of the ancient bacteria. Biologists now use this theory to explain the origin of the vast 
variety of eukaryotic organisms. Take the green algae that grow on 
the walls of swimming pools. A larger eukaryotic cell with spinning 
tail structures, or flagella, at some point absorbed algae like these
to form what we now call euglena. Euglena can perform photosynthesis, break down sugar using oxygen, and swim around pond water. And as the theory would predict, the chloroplasts in these euglena
have three membranes since they had two before being engulfed. The absorbing process
of endosymbiotic theory allowed organisms to combine 
powerful abilities to become better adapted to life on Earth. The results were species 
capable of much more than when they were separate organisms, and this was an evolutionary leap that lead to the microorganisms, plants, and animals we observe 
on the planet today.
