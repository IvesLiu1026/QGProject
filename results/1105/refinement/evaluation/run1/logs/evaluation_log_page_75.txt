Welcome to the TED-Ed beta website tour. I'm Logan Smalley, I'm Bedirhan Cinar, I'm Jordan Reeves, and I'm Stephanie Lo. We represent the TED-Ed team. We're going to tell you about
how the website is organized, about the lessons
that surround each video, how you can customize or flip
your own lesson, and how you can measure
the lesson's effect on your class or the world. Towards the end of the tour, we'll reveal one more major feature that directly affects
every person viewing this video. Let's get started with the home page. On the home page,
you'll find original TED-Ed videos, each is a lesson recorded
by an actual educator that's visualized
by a professional animator. You can nominate educators and animators in the "Get Involved" section of the site. The TED-Ed library can be browsed
through two different lenses. Learners can use the "Series" view
to browse videos thematically and based on their own curiosity. And teachers can use
the browse by "Subject" view to find the perfect short video
to show in class or to assign as homework. Every video on TED-Ed
is accompanied by a lesson. These lessons don't replace good teaching, but they can be supplementary resources for students and teachers
around the world. Let's look at this one, created by a teacher in the US
and an animator in the UK. When you arrive on the lesson page,
simply click play; the video will continue to play as you navigate the lesson's sections
that surround it. In the "Quick Quiz" section, you'll find multiple-choice questions that check for basic
comprehension of the video. You get real-time feedback on your answers and if you get one wrong,
you can use the video hint. You'll find open-answer questions
in the "Think" section. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you'll find additional resources
for exploring the topic. You can complete the lessons anonymously, but if you log in, you can track
your own learning across the site. Just visit the "Recent Activity" feed, and you'll find answers you've saved to lessons that you've already
started or completed. And now to one of the most powerful
features of the TED-Ed website: flipping a lesson. Flipping a featured lesson allows you
to edit each of the lesson's sections. You can edit the title
as it relates to your class. You can use the "Let's Begin" section to provide instructions
or context for the lesson. You can select or deselect
any "Quick Quiz" question. In the "Think" section, you can add your own
open-answer questions. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you can use the resources provided
or add your own. When you finish flipping a lesson, it'll publish to a new and unique URL. And because the link is unique, it can measure the progress
of any learner you share it with. You can use it to measure participation and accuracy of any individual
student's answers. So that's how you flip
a featured TED-Ed video, We've got one more major feature
to tell you about. Using the TED-Ed platform, you can flip any video from YouTube. That means you can create a lesson
around any TED Talk, any TEDx Talk, but also any of the other thousands
of great educational videos on YouTube, including the ones that you yourself
could record, upload and flip. And through flipping these lessons, together we'll create
a free and remarkable library of lessons worth sharing.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5: What is the benefit of flipping a featured lesson on the TED-Ed platform? 

However, the options provided in Question 5 do not exactly match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about the meaning of flipping a lesson.

Among the provided options, Question 5 is the closest match, but it does not perfectly align with the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose an index, I would say:

Index: 5

However, I would like to note that a more accurate generated MCQ would be one that directly asks "What does flipping a lesson mean?" with options that include "Customizing a lesson found on the TED-Ed website" as the correct answer.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I noticed that none of them directly ask about the meaning of flipping a lesson. Therefore, while Question 5 is the closest match, it is not a perfect match.

If possible, I would recommend generating new MCQs that directly address the concept of flipping a lesson to find a more accurate match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, I can try to find the one that is most similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about how to nominate an educator or animator, and the correct option is to go to the "Get Involved" page.

Among the generated MCQs, none of them ask about nominating an educator or animator directly. However, Question 2 mentions the "Series" view, which is related to browsing the TED-Ed library, and it also mentions that learners can use this view to browse videos thematically.

But Question 1 is the most similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of intent, as it asks about the primary purpose of the TED-Ed website, which is related to the website's features and functionality, including the "Get Involved" page.

However, I must note that the similarity between the ground truth MCQ and any of the generated MCQs is very low.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not among the provided options, as none of them match the ground truth MCQ's intent and content.

However, if I really had to choose one from the provided options, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but only very vaguely, and I would not consider it a good match.

So, my answer would be "None of the above," but if I really had to choose one, I would say:

 Question 1 (but with a very low confidence level).

**Transcript**:
Welcome to the TED-Ed beta website tour. I'm Logan Smalley, I'm Bedirhan Cinar, I'm Jordan Reeves, and I'm Stephanie Lo. We represent the TED-Ed team. We're going to tell you about
how the website is organized, about the lessons
that surround each video, how you can customize or flip
your own lesson, and how you can measure
the lesson's effect on your class or the world. Towards the end of the tour, we'll reveal one more major feature that directly affects
every person viewing this video. Let's get started with the home page. On the home page,
you'll find original TED-Ed videos, each is a lesson recorded
by an actual educator that's visualized
by a professional animator. You can nominate educators and animators in the "Get Involved" section of the site. The TED-Ed library can be browsed
through two different lenses. Learners can use the "Series" view
to browse videos thematically and based on their own curiosity. And teachers can use
the browse by "Subject" view to find the perfect short video
to show in class or to assign as homework. Every video on TED-Ed
is accompanied by a lesson. These lessons don't replace good teaching, but they can be supplementary resources for students and teachers
around the world. Let's look at this one, created by a teacher in the US
and an animator in the UK. When you arrive on the lesson page,
simply click play; the video will continue to play as you navigate the lesson's sections
that surround it. In the "Quick Quiz" section, you'll find multiple-choice questions that check for basic
comprehension of the video. You get real-time feedback on your answers and if you get one wrong,
you can use the video hint. You'll find open-answer questions
in the "Think" section. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you'll find additional resources
for exploring the topic. You can complete the lessons anonymously, but if you log in, you can track
your own learning across the site. Just visit the "Recent Activity" feed, and you'll find answers you've saved to lessons that you've already
started or completed. And now to one of the most powerful
features of the TED-Ed website: flipping a lesson. Flipping a featured lesson allows you
to edit each of the lesson's sections. You can edit the title
as it relates to your class. You can use the "Let's Begin" section to provide instructions
or context for the lesson. You can select or deselect
any "Quick Quiz" question. In the "Think" section, you can add your own
open-answer questions. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you can use the resources provided
or add your own. When you finish flipping a lesson, it'll publish to a new and unique URL. And because the link is unique, it can measure the progress
of any learner you share it with. You can use it to measure participation and accuracy of any individual
student's answers. So that's how you flip
a featured TED-Ed video, We've got one more major feature
to tell you about. Using the TED-Ed platform, you can flip any video from YouTube. That means you can create a lesson
around any TED Talk, any TEDx Talk, but also any of the other thousands
of great educational videos on YouTube, including the ones that you yourself
could record, upload and flip. And through flipping these lessons, together we'll create
a free and remarkable library of lessons worth sharing.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the options in Question 2 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent is the same, which is to ask about how learners can browse the TED-Ed library. The correct option in Question 2 is B, which is "By using the 'Series' view to browse videos thematically." The ground truth MCQ mentions that learners can browse by series and subject, which is not fully captured in Question 2. However, among the provided generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest match.

A more ideal match would be a generated MCQ with options that include both "By series" and "By subject" as separate options or a single option that mentions both, such as the ground truth MCQ's option D, "All of the above." However, given the provided generated MCQs, Question 2 is the most similar.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 2.

**Transcript**:
Welcome to the TED-Ed beta website tour. I'm Logan Smalley, I'm Bedirhan Cinar, I'm Jordan Reeves, and I'm Stephanie Lo. We represent the TED-Ed team. We're going to tell you about
how the website is organized, about the lessons
that surround each video, how you can customize or flip
your own lesson, and how you can measure
the lesson's effect on your class or the world. Towards the end of the tour, we'll reveal one more major feature that directly affects
every person viewing this video. Let's get started with the home page. On the home page,
you'll find original TED-Ed videos, each is a lesson recorded
by an actual educator that's visualized
by a professional animator. You can nominate educators and animators in the "Get Involved" section of the site. The TED-Ed library can be browsed
through two different lenses. Learners can use the "Series" view
to browse videos thematically and based on their own curiosity. And teachers can use
the browse by "Subject" view to find the perfect short video
to show in class or to assign as homework. Every video on TED-Ed
is accompanied by a lesson. These lessons don't replace good teaching, but they can be supplementary resources for students and teachers
around the world. Let's look at this one, created by a teacher in the US
and an animator in the UK. When you arrive on the lesson page,
simply click play; the video will continue to play as you navigate the lesson's sections
that surround it. In the "Quick Quiz" section, you'll find multiple-choice questions that check for basic
comprehension of the video. You get real-time feedback on your answers and if you get one wrong,
you can use the video hint. You'll find open-answer questions
in the "Think" section. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you'll find additional resources
for exploring the topic. You can complete the lessons anonymously, but if you log in, you can track
your own learning across the site. Just visit the "Recent Activity" feed, and you'll find answers you've saved to lessons that you've already
started or completed. And now to one of the most powerful
features of the TED-Ed website: flipping a lesson. Flipping a featured lesson allows you
to edit each of the lesson's sections. You can edit the title
as it relates to your class. You can use the "Let's Begin" section to provide instructions
or context for the lesson. You can select or deselect
any "Quick Quiz" question. In the "Think" section, you can add your own
open-answer questions. And in the "Dig Deeper" section, you can use the resources provided
or add your own. When you finish flipping a lesson, it'll publish to a new and unique URL. And because the link is unique, it can measure the progress
of any learner you share it with. You can use it to measure participation and accuracy of any individual
student's answers. So that's how you flip
