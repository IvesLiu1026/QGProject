**Transcript**:
It’s 5 p.m. and you’ve just realized 
that report you’ve been putting off is due tomorrow. It’s time to buckle down, 
open your computer... and check your phone. Maybe catch up on your favorite
YouTube channel? Actually, you should probably 
make dinner first. You usually like cooking, though it’s hard to enjoy with this work
hanging over your head, and oh— it’s actually pretty late! Maybe you should just try again
in the morning? This is the cycle of procrastination,
and I promise you, we have all been there. But why do we keep procrastinating 
even when we know it’s bad for us? To be clear, putting something off isn’t
always procrastinating. Responsible time management requires
deciding which tasks are important and which ones can wait. Procrastination is when we avoid a task 
we said we would do, for no good reason, despite expecting our behavior 
to bring negative consequences. Obviously, it’s irrational to do something
you expect to harm you. But ironically, procrastination is the 
result of our bodies trying to protect us, specifically by avoiding a task 
we see as threatening. When you realize you need
to write that report, your brain responds like it would
to any incoming threat. Your amygdala, a set of neurons 
involved in emotional processing and threat identification, releases hormones including adrenaline
that kick off a fear response. This stress-induced panic can overpower
the impulses from your prefrontal cortex, which typically help you think 
long term and regulate your emotions. And it’s in the midst
of this fight, flight, or freeze response that you decide to handle the threat by avoiding it in favor
of some less stressful task. This response might seem extreme— after all, it’s just a deadline,
not a bear attack. But we’re most likely to procrastinate
tasks that evoke negative feelings, such as dread, incompetence,
and insecurity. Studies of procrastinating university
students have found participants were more likely to put off tasks they
perceived as stressful or challenging. And the perception of how difficult
the task is increases while you’re putting it off. In one experiment, students were given
reminders to study throughout the day. While they were studying,
most reported that it wasn’t so bad. But when they were procrastinating, they consistently rated the idea
of studying as very stressful, making it difficult to get started. Because procrastination is motivated
by our negative feelings, some individuals are more susceptible
to it than others. People who have difficulty
regulating their emotions and those who struggle 
with low self-esteem are much more likely to procrastinate, regardless of how good
they are at time management. However, it's a common misconception
that all procrastinators are lazy. In the body and brain, laziness is marked
by no energy and general apathy. When you’re feeling lazy, you’re more
likely to sit around doing nothing than distract yourself 
with unimportant tasks. In fact, many people procrastinate
because they care too much. Procrastinators often report
a high fear of failure, putting things off because they’re afraid
their work won’t live up to their high standards. Whatever the reason for procrastination, 
the results are often the same. Frequent procrastinators are likely 
to suffer from anxiety and depression, ongoing feelings of shame, higher stress levels and physical ailments
associated with high stress. Worst of all, while procrastination
hurts us in the long run, it does temporarily reduce
our stress level, reinforcing it as a bodily response
for coping with stressful tasks. So, how can we break the cycle
of procrastination? Traditionally, people thought 
procrastinators needed to cultivate discipline and practice 
strict time management. But today, many researchers
feel the exact opposite. Being too hard on yourself can layer
additional bad emotions onto a task, making the threat even more intense. To short-circuit this stress response, we need to address and reduce
these negative emotions. Some simple strategies include breaking
a task into smaller elements or journaling about why
it's stressing you out and addressing those underlying concerns. Try removing nearby distractions that make
it easy to impulsively procrastinate. And more than anything, it helps to
cultivate an attitude of self-compassion, forgiving yourself,
and making a plan to do better next time. Because a culture that perpetuates
this cycle of stress and procrastination hurts all of us in the long term.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 7: What is the main misconception about procrastinators?**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match can be found by analyzing the options of the generated MCQs.

A better match is **Question 3: Why do people often procrastinate tasks that evoke negative feelings?**, but it still doesn't perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon closer inspection, I found that **none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ**. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose:

**Question 8: Why is it common for people to procrastinate tasks that they perceive as stressful or challenging?**

This question is related to the characteristics of procrastinators, but it does not directly ask about the groups of people most likely to be procrastinators.

If I had to choose an answer, I would say that **Question 8** is the most similar generated MCQ, but I want to emphasize that it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the groups of people most likely to be procrastinators, such as:

Question: Which of the following groups of people are most likely to procrastinate?
Options: A. People who struggle with self-control and impulsivity, B. People who struggle with low self-esteem and emotional regulation, C. People who struggle with low energy and general apathy, D. People who struggle with insomnia and dietary balance

Unfortunately, this question is not among the generated MCQs.

Therefore, my answer is **8**, but I want to emphasize that it's not a perfect match.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 1, Question 5
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
It’s 5 p.m. and you’ve just realized 
that report you’ve been putting off is due tomorrow. It’s time to buckle down, 
open your computer... and check your phone. Maybe catch up on your favorite
YouTube channel? Actually, you should probably 
make dinner first. You usually like cooking, though it’s hard to enjoy with this work
hanging over your head, and oh— it’s actually pretty late! Maybe you should just try again
in the morning? This is the cycle of procrastination,
and I promise you, we have all been there. But why do we keep procrastinating 
even when we know it’s bad for us? To be clear, putting something off isn’t
always procrastinating. Responsible time management requires
deciding which tasks are important and which ones can wait. Procrastination is when we avoid a task 
we said we would do, for no good reason, despite expecting our behavior 
to bring negative consequences. Obviously, it’s irrational to do something
you expect to harm you. But ironically, procrastination is the 
result of our bodies trying to protect us, specifically by avoiding a task 
we see as threatening. When you realize you need
to write that report, your brain responds like it would
to any incoming threat. Your amygdala, a set of neurons 
involved in emotional processing and threat identification, releases hormones including adrenaline
that kick off a fear response. This stress-induced panic can overpower
the impulses from your prefrontal cortex, which typically help you think 
long term and regulate your emotions. And it’s in the midst
of this fight, flight, or freeze response that you decide to handle the threat by avoiding it in favor
of some less stressful task. This response might seem extreme— after all, it’s just a deadline,
not a bear attack. But we’re most likely to procrastinate
tasks that evoke negative feelings, such as dread, incompetence,
and insecurity. Studies of procrastinating university
students have found participants were more likely to put off tasks they
perceived as stressful or challenging. And the perception of how difficult
the task is increases while you’re putting it off. In one experiment, students were given
reminders to study throughout the day. While they were studying,
most reported that it wasn’t so bad. But when they were procrastinating, they consistently rated the idea
of studying as very stressful, making it difficult to get started. Because procrastination is motivated
by our negative feelings, some individuals are more susceptible
to it than others. People who have difficulty
regulating their emotions and those who struggle 
with low self-esteem are much more likely to procrastinate, regardless of how good
they are at time management. However, it's a common misconception
that all procrastinators are lazy. In the body and brain, laziness is marked
by no energy and general apathy. When you’re feeling lazy, you’re more
likely to sit around doing nothing than distract yourself 
with unimportant tasks. In fact, many people procrastinate
because they care too much. Procrastinators often report
a high fear of failure, putting things off because they’re afraid
their work won’t live up to their high standards. Whatever the reason for procrastination, 
the results are often the same. Frequent procrastinators are likely 
to suffer from anxiety and depression, ongoing feelings of shame, higher stress levels and physical ailments
associated with high stress. Worst of all, while procrastination
hurts us in the long run, it does temporarily reduce
our stress level, reinforcing it as a bodily response
for coping with stressful tasks. So, how can we break the cycle
of procrastination? Traditionally, people thought 
procrastinators needed to cultivate discipline and practice 
strict time management. But today, many researchers
feel the exact opposite. Being too hard on yourself can layer
additional bad emotions onto a task, making the threat even more intense. To short-circuit this stress response, we need to address and reduce
these negative emotions. Some simple strategies include breaking
a task into smaller elements or journaling about why
it's stressing you out and addressing those underlying concerns. Try removing nearby distractions that make
it easy to impulsively procrastinate. And more than anything, it helps to
cultivate an attitude of self-compassion, forgiving yourself,
and making a plan to do better next time. Because a culture that perpetuates
this cycle of stress and procrastination hurts all of us in the long term.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
¿Hablas español? Parlez-vous français? 
你会说中文吗？ If you answered, "sí," "oui," or "会"
and you're watching this in English, chances are you belong to the world's
bilingual and multilingual majority. And besides having 
an easier time traveling or watching movies without subtitles, knowing two or more languages
means that your brain may actually look and work differently
than those of your monolingual friends. So what does it really 
mean to know a language? Language ability is typically measured
in two active parts, speaking and writing, and two passive parts, 
listening and reading. While a balanced bilingual has near equal abilities across the board 
in two languages, most bilinguals around the world
know and use their languages in varying proportions. And depending on their situation
and how they acquired each language, they can be classified into
three general types. For example, let's take Gabriella, whose family immigrates to the US 
from Peru when she's two-years old. As a compound bilingual, Gabriella develops two linguistic 
codes simultaneously, with a single set of concepts, learning both English and Spanish as she begins to process 
the world around her. Her teenage brother, on the other hand,
might be a coordinate bilingual, working with two sets of concepts, learning English in school, while continuing to speak Spanish
at home and with friends. Finally, Gabriella's parents are likely
to be subordinate bilinguals who learn a secondary language by filtering it through
their primary language. Because all types of bilingual people
can become fully proficient in a language regardless of accent or pronunciation, the difference may not be apparent
to a casual observer. But recent advances 
in brain imaging technology have given neurolinguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language
learning affect the bilingual brain. It's well known that the brain's
left hemisphere is more dominant and analytical in logical processes, while the right hemisphere is more active
in emotional and social ones, though this is a matter of degree,
not an absolute split. The fact that language involves
both types of functions while lateralization develops
gradually with age, has lead to the critical 
period hypothesis. According to this theory, children learn languages more easily because the plasticity 
of their developing brains lets them use both hemispheres
in language acquisition, while in most adults, language 
is lateralized to one hemisphere, usually the left. If this is true, learning a language
in childhood may give you a more holistic grasp
of its social and emotional contexts. Conversely, recent research showed that people who learned 
a second language in adulthood exhibit less emotional bias
and a more rational approach when confronting problems
in the second language than in their native one. But regardless of when you acquire
additional languages, being multilingual gives your brain
some remarkable advantages. Some of these are even visible, such as higher density of the grey matter that contains most of your brain's 
neurons and synapses, and more activity in certain regions
when engaging a second language. The heightened workout a bilingual
brain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases,
like Alzheimer's and dementia by as much as five years. The idea of major cognitive 
benefits to bilingualism may seem intuitive now, but it would have surprised 
earlier experts. Before the 1960s, bilingualism
was considered a handicap that slowed a child's development by forcing them to spend too much energy
distinguishing between languages, a view based largely on flawed studies. And while a more recent study did show that reaction times and errors increase
for some bilingual students in cross-language tests, it also showed that the effort
and attention needed to switch between languages
triggered more activity in, and potentially strengthened,
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This is the part of the brain
that plays a large role in executive function, problem solving,
switching between tasks, and focusing while filtering out
irrelevant information. So, while bilingualism may not
necessarily make you smarter, it does make your brain more healthy,
complex and actively engaged, and even if you didn't have 
the good fortune of learning a second language as a child, it's never too late to do 
yourself a favor and make the linguistic 
leap from, "Hello," to, "Hola," "Bonjour" or "你好’s" because when it comes to our brains
a little exercise can go a long way.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match.

Although Question 8 does not directly ask about the parts in which language ability is typically measured, it does relate to the concept of language lateralization in the brain, which is mentioned in the same section of the transcript as the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a question that is more related to the concept of language ability, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, as it talks about the differences in language processing between different types of bilinguals, which is somewhat related to the concept of language ability.

However, please note that this is a very weak match, and it would be better to generate new MCQs that more directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1 (with a big caveat that it's not a great match)

**Transcript**:
Hunger claws at your grumbling belly. It tugs at your intestines, 
which begin to writhe, aching to be fed. Being hungry generates a powerful,
often unpleasant physical sensation that's almost impossible to ignore. After you've reacted by gorging
on your morning pancakes, you start to experience 
an opposing force, fullness, but how does your body actually know
when you're full? The sensation of fullness is set in motion
as food moves from your mouth down your esophagus. Once it hits your stomach,
it gradually fills the space. That causes the surrounding
muscular wall to stretch, expanding slowly like a balloon. A multitude of nerves wrapped
intricately around the stomach wall sense the stretching. They communicate with the vagus nerve
up to the brainstem and hypothalamus, the main parts of the brain
that control food intake. But that's just one input your brain uses
to sense fullness. After all, if you fill 
your stomach with water, you won't feel full for long. Your brain also takes into account
chemical messengers in the form of hormones produced
by endocrine cells throughout your digestive system. These respond to the presence of specific
nutrients in your gut and bloodstream, which gradually increase 
as you digest your food. As the hormones seep out, 
they're swept up by the blood and eventually reach the hypothalamus
in the brain. Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones 
are involved in moderating our appetites. One example is cholecystokinin, which is produced in response to food
by cells in the upper small bowel. When it reached the hypothalamus, it causes a reduction in the feeling
of reward you get when you eat food. When that occurs, the sense
of being satiated starts to sink in and you stop eating. Cholecystokinin also slows down
the movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. That makes your stomach stretch
more over a period of time, allowing your body to register
that you're filling up. This seems to be why when you eat slowly,
you actually feel fuller compared to when you consume your food
at lightning speed. When you eat quickly, your body doesn't
have time to recognize the state it's in. Once nutrients and gastrointestinal
hormones are present in the blood, they trigger the pancreas
to release insulin. Insulin stimulates the body's fat cells
to make another hormone called leptin. Leptin reacts with receptors
on neuron populations in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has two sets of neurons
important for our feeling of hunger. One set produces the sensation of hunger
by making and releasing certain proteins. The other set inhibits hunger through
its own set of compounds. Leptin inhibits the hypothalamus neurons
that drive food intake and stimulates the neurons 
that suppress it. By this point, your body has reached
peak fullness. Through the constant exchange 
of information between hormones, the vagus nerve, the brainstem, and the different portions 
of hypothalamus, your brain gets the signal
that you've eaten enough. Researchers have discovered that some foods produce 
more long-lasting fullness than others. For instance, boiled potatoes are ranked as some of the most 
hunger-satisfying foods, while croissants 
are particularly unsatisfying. In general, foods with more protein,
fiber, and water tend to keep hunger at bay for longer. But feeling full won't last forever. After a few hours, your gut and brain
begin their conversation again. Your empty stomach produces
other hormones, such as ghrelin, that increase the activity of 
the hunger-causing nerve cells in the hypothalamus. Eventually, the growling beast of hunger
is reawakened. Luckily, there's a dependable 
antidote for that.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. However, it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks about the part of the brain that controls food intake, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the parts of the body that sense the fullness of the stomach.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the vagus nerve, brainstem, and hypothalamus. Unfortunately, there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the content, I would choose Question 4. It mentions the vagus nerve and the process of registering the state of fullness, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the options, I would choose Question 6. It mentions the hypothalamus neurons, which is one of the correct options in the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a perfect match, I will choose Question 4 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it is the closest match based on the content.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 4 is not the most similar, but Question 11 has some elements of the ground truth MCQ. However the most similar is Question 3's option D precursor:** 
 Question 3 mentions "stretched due to food intake" this implies nutrients are in the stomach which is an element of the ground truth MCQ. However, this is still not the most similar.

**The most similar is Question 11's precursor: Question 4's precursor:** 
 Question 4 mentions "register the state it's in" which is a signal or a result of nutrients in the stomach, this question is still not the most similar but it has elements that can be used to create the most similar.

**The most similar generated MCQ is not among the options, however the most similar is a question that can be created using elements of question 3 and question 4:**
 Since the most similar generated MCQ is not among the options, I will choose the generated MCQ that has the most elements of the ground truth MCQ.

**The most similar generated MCQ is Question 11:** 
Although Question 11 does not directly ask about the signal for the release of satiety hormones, it does mention the presence of certain nutrients, fiber, and water, which are related to the release of satiety hormones.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs either ask about different aspects of the topic or have different options.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 11 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
Hunger claws at your grumbling belly. It tugs at your intestines, 
which begin to writhe, aching to be fed. Being hungry generates a powerful,
often unpleasant physical sensation that's almost impossible to ignore. After you've reacted by gorging
on your morning pancakes, you start to experience 
an opposing force, fullness, but how does your body actually know
when you're full? The sensation of fullness is set in motion
as food moves from your mouth down your esophagus. Once it hits your stomach,
it gradually fills the space. That causes the surrounding
muscular wall to stretch, expanding slowly like a balloon. A multitude of nerves wrapped
intricately around the stomach wall sense the stretching. They communicate with the vagus nerve
up to the brainstem and hypothalamus, the main parts of the brain
that control food intake. But that's just one input your brain uses
to sense fullness. After all, if you fill 
your stomach with water, you won't feel full for long. Your brain also takes into account
chemical messengers in the form of hormones produced
by endocrine cells throughout your digestive system. These respond to the presence of specific
nutrients in your gut and bloodstream, which gradually increase 
as you digest your food. As the hormones seep out, 
they're swept up by the blood and eventually reach the hypothalamus
in the brain. Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones 
are involved in moderating our appetites. One example is cholecystokinin, which is produced in response to food
by cells in the upper small bowel. When it reached the hypothalamus, it causes a reduction in the feeling
of reward you get when you eat food. When that occurs, the sense
of being satiated starts to sink in and you stop eating. Cholecystokinin also slows down
the movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. That makes your stomach stretch
more over a period of time, allowing your body to register
that you're filling up. This seems to be why when you eat slowly,
you actually feel fuller compared to when you consume your food
at lightning speed. When you eat quickly, your body doesn't
have time to recognize the state it's in. Once nutrients and gastrointestinal
hormones are present in the blood, they trigger the pancreas
to release insulin. Insulin stimulates the body's fat cells
to make another hormone called leptin. Leptin reacts with receptors
on neuron populations in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has two sets of neurons
important for our feeling of hunger. One set produces the sensation of hunger
by making and releasing certain proteins. The other set inhibits hunger through
its own set of compounds. Leptin inhibits the hypothalamus neurons
that drive food intake and stimulates the neurons 
that suppress it. By this point, your body has reached
peak fullness. Through the constant exchange 
of information between hormones, the vagus nerve, the brainstem, and the different portions 
of hypothalamus, your brain gets the signal
that you've eaten enough. Researchers have discovered that some foods produce 
more long-lasting fullness than others. For instance, boiled potatoes are ranked as some of the most 
hunger-satisfying foods, while croissants 
are particularly unsatisfying. In general, foods with more protein,
fiber, and water tend to keep hunger at bay for longer. But feeling full won't last forever. After a few hours, your gut and brain
begin their conversation again. Your empty stomach produces
other hormones, such as ghrelin, that increase the activity of 
the hunger-causing nerve cells in the hypothalamus. Eventually, the growling beast of hunger
is reawakened. Luckily, there's a dependable 
antidote for that.

Right now, you're probably sitting down
to watch this video and staying seated for a few minutes
to view it is probably okay. But the longer you stay put,
the more agitated your body becomes. It sits there counting down the moments
until you stand up again and take it for a walk. That may sound ridiculous. Our bodies love to sit, right? Not really. Sure, sitting for brief periods 
can help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise. But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit
much more than we move around, and our bodies simply aren't built
for such a sedentary existence. In fact, just the opposite is true. The human body is built to move, and you can see evidence of that
in the way it's structured. Inside us are over 360 joints,
and about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy, fluid motion. The body's unique physical structure
gives us the ability to stand up straight against the pull of gravity. Our blood depends on us moving around
to be able to circulate properly. Our nerve cells benefit from movement, and our skin is elastic, 
meaning it molds to our motions. So if every inch of the body
is ready and waiting for you to move, what happens when you just don't? Let's start with the backbone
of the problem, literally. Your spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs
that sit between them. Joints, muscles and ligaments
that are attached to the bones hold it all together. A common way of sitting is with a
curved back and slumped shoulders, a position that puts uneven
pressure on your spine. Over time, this causes wear and tear
in your spinal discs, overworks certain ligaments and joints, and puts strain on muscles that stretch to accommodate 
your back's curved position. This hunched shape also shrinks
your chest cavity while you sit, meaning your lungs have less space
to expand into when you breath. That's a problem because it temporarily
limits the amount of oxygen that fills your lungs
and filters into your blood. Around the skeleton are the muscles,
nerves, arteries and veins that form the body's soft tissue layers. The very act of sitting squashes,
pressurizes and compresses, and these more delicate tissues
really feel the brunt. Have you ever experienced numbness
and swelling in your limbs when you sit? In areas that are the most compressed, your nerves, arteries and veins
can become blocked, which limits nerve signaling,
causing the numbness, and reduces blood flow in your limbs,
causing them to swell. Sitting for long periods also temporarily
deactivates lipoprotein lipase, a special enzyme in the walls
of blood capillaries that breaks down fats in the blood, so when you sit, you're not burning fat
nearly as well as when you move around. What effect does all of this stasis
have on the brain? Most of the time, 
you probably sit down to use your brain, but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting
actually run counter to this goal. Being stationary reduces blood flow and the amount of oxygen entering
your blood stream through your lungs. Your brain requires both 
of those things to remain alert, so your concentration levels
will most likely dip as your brain activity slows. Unfortunately, the ill effects of being
seated don't only exist in the short term. Recent studies have found 
that sitting for long periods is linked with some types of cancers
and heart disease and can contribute to diabetes,
kidney and liver problems. In fact, researchers 
have worked out that, worldwide, inactivity causes about 
9% of premature deaths a year. That's over 5 million people. So what seems like such a harmless habit actually has the power 
to change our health. But luckily, the solutions to this
mounting threat are simple and intuitive. When you have no choice but to sit, try switching the slouch 
for a straighter spine, and when you don't have 
to be bound to your seat, aim to move around much more, perhaps by setting a reminder
to yourself to get up every half hour. But mostly, just appreciate that bodies
are built for motion, not for stillness. In fact, since the video's almost over,
why not stand up and stretch right now? Treat your body to a walk. It'll thank you later.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ because they appear to be related to a different topic, specifically vitamins and supplements, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the negative effects of sitting.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall intent of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you'd like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that are more relevant to the topic of the transcript, and then I can try to find a match.

**Transcript**:
Right now, you're probably sitting down
to watch this video and staying seated for a few minutes
to view it is probably okay. But the longer you stay put,
the more agitated your body becomes. It sits there counting down the moments
until you stand up again and take it for a walk. That may sound ridiculous. Our bodies love to sit, right? Not really. Sure, sitting for brief periods 
can help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise. But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit
much more than we move around, and our bodies simply aren't built
for such a sedentary existence. In fact, just the opposite is true. The human body is built to move, and you can see evidence of that
in the way it's structured. Inside us are over 360 joints,
and about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy, fluid motion. The body's unique physical structure
gives us the ability to stand up straight against the pull of gravity. Our blood depends on us moving around
to be able to circulate properly. Our nerve cells benefit from movement, and our skin is elastic, 
meaning it molds to our motions. So if every inch of the body
is ready and waiting for you to move, what happens when you just don't? Let's start with the backbone
of the problem, literally. Your spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs
that sit between them. Joints, muscles and ligaments
that are attached to the bones hold it all together. A common way of sitting is with a
curved back and slumped shoulders, a position that puts uneven
pressure on your spine. Over time, this causes wear and tear
in your spinal discs, overworks certain ligaments and joints, and puts strain on muscles that stretch to accommodate 
your back's curved position. This hunched shape also shrinks
your chest cavity while you sit, meaning your lungs have less space
to expand into when you breath. That's a problem because it temporarily
limits the amount of oxygen that fills your lungs
and filters into your blood. Around the skeleton are the muscles,
nerves, arteries and veins that form the body's soft tissue layers. The very act of sitting squashes,
pressurizes and compresses, and these more delicate tissues
really feel the brunt. Have you ever experienced numbness
and swelling in your limbs when you sit? In areas that are the most compressed, your nerves, arteries and veins
can become blocked, which limits nerve signaling,
causing the numbness, and reduces blood flow in your limbs,
causing them to swell. Sitting for long periods also temporarily
deactivates lipoprotein lipase, a special enzyme in the walls
of blood capillaries that breaks down fats in the blood, so when you sit, you're not burning fat
nearly as well as when you move around. What effect does all of this stasis
have on the brain? Most of the time, 
you probably sit down to use your brain, but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting
actually run counter to this goal. Being stationary reduces blood flow and the amount of oxygen entering
your blood stream through your lungs. Your brain requires both 
of those things to remain alert, so your concentration levels
will most likely dip as your brain activity slows. Unfortunately, the ill effects of being
seated don't only exist in the short term. Recent studies have found 
that sitting for long periods is linked with some types of cancers
and heart disease and can contribute to diabetes,
kidney and liver problems. In fact, researchers 
have worked out that, worldwide, inactivity causes about 
9% of premature deaths a year. That's over 5 million people. So what seems like such a harmless habit actually has the power 
to change our health. But luckily, the solutions to this
mounting threat are simple and intuitive. When you have no choice but to sit, try switching the slouch 
for a straighter spine, and when you don't have 
to be bound to your seat, aim to move around much more, perhaps by setting a reminder
to yourself to get up every half hour. But mostly, just appreciate that bodies
are built for motion, not for stillness. In fact, since the video's almost over,

**Transcript**:
(intro song) From colorful pills to chewy gummies in the shape of your favorite cartoon character There are tons of multivitamin supplements to choose from and people spend billions of dollars every year trying to boost their health with them. But if you look on the back of the bottle lots of these supplements have more than 100%. Sometimes up to 500% or 2000% of the recommended daily value for different vitamins inside. So, why are they so jam-packed with vitamins? And is taking all these supplements actually good for you? Well, if you are healthy and eating a balanced diet, you should be getting all the vitamins you need. So at best, they probably aren't doing very much. At worst, they could be doing you harm. Vitamins are important compounds that our bodies need to grow and function. But we need to get them from food because we can't make them, or enough of them, ourselves. There are fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K which means they dissolve in lipids and B vitamins and Vitamin C are water-soluble which means they dissolve in water. And different vitamins come from different foods. Vitamin K, for example, can come from dark green vegetables, while Vitamin C is in all kinds of citrus fruits, and your body can vitamin D after spending some time in the sun. If you're deficient in any of them, your cells and enzymes won't be able to work properly, and you could be prone to diseases. So the reason to taking multi-vitamin supplements is usually to prevent any vitamin deficiencies. Sounds reasonable. But taking supplements when you don't actually need them can cause problems. Multi-vitamins generally have more than 100% of your Recommended Dietary Allowance, or RDA. RDA values are set by national organizations that study food and nutrition. They're basically the estimated nutrient requirements for healthy people. The same scientific committees also estimate a tolerable Upper intake Level, or UL which is the max amount of these nutrients you can take, without risking some negative health effects. Generally, the levels for water-soluble vitamins are a lot higher than for fat-soluable vitamins. Either way, when you take a multivitamin that has more than 100% of the RDA for different vitamins, your body might not be digesting and absorbing it all. Your body tends to get rid of any excess water-soluble vitamins by peeing them out. But it stores the extra fat-soluble vitamins in your fatty tissues. The problem is megadoses of vitamins. If you consistently take the UL dose over weeks or months, especially with fat-soluble vitamins, these vitamins will keep building up in your body, and eventually cause toxicity or other health problems. For example, Vitamin D normally helps your body absorb calcium but a lot Vitamin D could cause a buildup of calcium in your blood called Hypercalcemia or even damage your heart. So even though your body needs vitamins to survive, taking multivitamins doesn't replace the nutrients you get from a balanced diet, and can even be harmful if you overdo it. If you have some sort of health condition, or pregnant, definitely listen to your doctor and the supplements they recommend. But, usually just taking a bunch of extra multivitamins won't do much for your health. Thanks to Patreon patreon Richard Willis for asking this question.

So even though your body needs vitamins to survive, taking multivitamins doesn't replace the nutrients you get from a balanced diet, and can even be harmful if you overdo it. If you have some sort of health condition, or pregnant, definitely listen to your doctor and the supplements they recommend. But, usually just taking a bunch of extra multivitamins won't do much for your health. Thanks to Patreon patreon Richard Willis for asking this question.

**Transcript**:
It's easy to tell when someone's
not paying attention, but it can be surprisingly tricky to know
what truly excellent listening looks like. Behavioral scientists have found
that good listening is one of the most important things 
we can do to improve our relationships, develop our worldview, and potentially
even change people's minds. So, what can we do to become
better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one
conversation is about taking an interest in another person 
and making them feel understood. There’s no universally agreed 
upon definition of high-quality listening, but some recurring features include
attentiveness, conveying understanding, and showing a positive intention
towards the speaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply
go through the motions— researchers have found
that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals doesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly
performative about listening in that it’s important to show 
you’re doing it. So, in addition to actively attending
to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions
and body language that indicate their understanding
and their desire to understand. This might feel awkward at first, and what’s most effective might depend
on your relationship with the speaker. But with time and practice you can
internalize these basic behaviors. So let’s say a good friend wants
to tell you about an issue they’re having with their partner. Before even starting your conversation, remove any distractions 
in the environment. Turn off the TV, take off your headphones 
and put your phone away— far away. One study showed that even
the visible presence of a phone made conversations feel less
intimate and fulfilling to those involved. Once the conversation begins, one of the most important things 
you can do is also the most obvious— try not to interrupt. This doesn’t mean
you need to stay completely silent. But if you do interject, 
look for natural pauses to ask open-ended questions
that benefit the speaker, not just your curiosity. Questions like “What happened next?”
or “How did that make you feel?” confirm that you’re following
the story while also helping the speaker dive deeper into their own thoughts. Another great way to show your
understanding is by summarizing what you just heard 
and asking if you’ve missed anything. Summaries like this show the speaker that
you're truly trying to understand them rather than just waiting
for your turn to talk. Speaking of which, while a good
conversation requires back and forth, planning out your response 
while the speaker is talking is a common way to miss what’s being said. So try to stay present 
and if you lose focus, don't be shy about asking the speaker
to repeat what you missed. This might feel embarrassing, but asking for clarification actually
shows that you’re committed to understanding. Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to ask for a moment to formulate
your response and taking a beat to think can help 
speakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small changes, 
but together they make a big difference. And when people feel heard, 
they report more satisfaction, trust, and connection 
in their relationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard
generally experience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened
to them more favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be
easy to listen to some people, it can be hard to muster all
this focus and attention if you disagree with 
or dislike the speaker. But these situations might actually
benefit most from your efforts to listen openly. The theory of psychological reactance
suggests that trying to force someone to change their mind makes them
more likely to defend their point of view. However, recent studies suggest 
that high-quality listening fosters open-mindedness by creating 
a non-judgmental and psychologically safe environment. Of course, truly open-minded listening
isn’t about changing people’s minds. Good listening is not 
the same as agreeing, and conversations don’t have 
to end with a happy resolution. But even during a disagreement, sometimes being heard is enough 
to start a deeper conversation.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the purpose of listening in a one-on-one conversation, and the correct option is "Making the speaker feel understood."

Among the generated MCQs, Question 14 is about people's relationship with their phones, but it's not directly related to the ground truth MCQ. However, I found that Question 16 is about the relationship between technology and our attention, which is somewhat related to the concept of listening.

But the most similar generated MCQ I could find is not among the provided options. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as phone usage, boredom, and creativity.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 14 is the most similar, but it's still not a good match. Therefore, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that is more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I must provide an index, I would say:

Index: 14 (Please note that this is not a good match, and a new generated MCQ should be created to match the ground truth MCQ.)

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about identifying a behavior that is NOT a good way to show someone you're listening to them. The correct answer is "Interrupting to offer a personal anecdote."

Among the generated MCQs, I found that Question 13 is somewhat related to the topic of listening and attention. However, it's not a direct match.

A more relevant question would be one that discusses good or bad listening habits. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address this topic.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 16. This question discusses the relationship between technology and our attention, which is tangentially related to the topic of listening.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 16 (Note: This is a weak match, and a more relevant question would be needed to accurately assess the topic of good or bad listening habits.)

you're truly trying to understand them rather than just waiting
for your turn to talk. Speaking of which, while a good
conversation requires back and forth, planning out your response 
while the speaker is talking is a common way to miss what’s being said. So try to stay present 
and if you lose focus, don't be shy about asking the speaker
to repeat what you missed. This might feel embarrassing, but asking for clarification actually
shows that you’re committed to understanding. Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to ask for a moment to formulate
your response and taking a beat to think can help 
speakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small changes, 
but together they make a big difference. And when people feel heard, 
they report more satisfaction, trust, and connection 
in their relationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard
generally experience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened
to them more favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be
easy to listen to some people, it can be hard to muster all
this focus and attention if you disagree with 
or dislike the speaker. But these situations might actually
benefit most from your efforts to listen openly. The theory of psychological reactance
suggests that trying to force someone to change their mind makes them
more likely to defend their point of view. However, recent studies suggest 
that high-quality listening fosters open-mindedness by creating 
a non-judgmental and psychologically safe environment. Of course, truly open-minded listening
isn’t about changing people’s minds. Good listening is not 
the same as agreeing, and conversations don’t have 
to end with a happy resolution. But even during a disagreement, sometimes being heard is enough 
to start a deeper conversation.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the importance of staying present in a conversation and not planning one's response while the speaker is talking. The correct answer is "D. All of the above," which includes the reasons that the listener is not remaining present in the conversation, might miss details of what is being said, and may be displaying a lack of interest in the speaker's thoughts.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 13 is the most similar in terms of intent and content. It asks about what happens to the brain when we multitask, and the correct answer is "B. We rapidly shift between tasks and deplete neural resources." Although this question is not directly related to the importance of staying present in a conversation, it touches on the idea of divided attention and the potential consequences of not focusing on a single task.

However, I must note that Question 13 is not a perfect match, and the ground truth MCQ is more specific to the context of conversations and listening.

If I had to choose an index, I would say that Question 13 is the most similar generated MCQ, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
It's easy to tell when someone's
not paying attention, but it can be surprisingly tricky to know
what truly excellent listening looks like. Behavioral scientists have found
that good listening is one of the most important things 
we can do to improve our relationships, develop our worldview, and potentially
even change people's minds. So, what can we do to become
better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one
conversation is about taking an interest in another person 
and making them feel understood. There’s no universally agreed 
upon definition of high-quality listening, but some recurring features include
attentiveness, conveying understanding, and showing a positive intention
towards the speaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply
go through the motions— researchers have found
that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals doesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly
performative about listening in that it’s important to show 
you’re doing it. So, in addition to actively attending
to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions
and body language that indicate their understanding
and their desire to understand. This might feel awkward at first, and what’s most effective might depend
on your relationship with the speaker. But with time and practice you can
internalize these basic behaviors. So let’s say a good friend wants
to tell you about an issue they’re having with their partner. Before even starting your conversation, remove any distractions 
in the environment. Turn off the TV, take off your headphones 
and put your phone away— far away. One study showed that even
the visible presence of a phone made conversations feel less
intimate and fulfilling to those involved. Once the conversation begins, one of the most important things 
you can do is also the most obvious— try not to interrupt. This doesn’t mean
you need to stay completely silent. But if you do interject, 
look for natural pauses to ask open-ended questions
that benefit the speaker, not just your curiosity. Questions like “What happened next?”
or “How did that make you feel?” confirm that you’re following
the story while also helping the speaker dive deeper into their own thoughts. Another great way to show your
understanding is by summarizing what you just heard 
and asking if you’ve missed anything. Summaries like this show the speaker that
you're truly trying to understand them rather than just waiting
for your turn to talk. Speaking of which, while a good
conversation requires back and forth, planning out your response 
while the speaker is talking is a common way to miss what’s being said. So try to stay present 
and if you lose focus, don't be shy about asking the speaker
to repeat what you missed. This might feel embarrassing, but asking for clarification actually
shows that you’re committed to understanding. Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to ask for a moment to formulate
your response and taking a beat to think can help 
speakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small changes, 
but together they make a big difference. And when people feel heard, 
they report more satisfaction, trust, and connection 
in their relationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard
generally experience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened
to them more favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be
easy to listen to some people, it can be hard to muster all
this focus and attention if you disagree with

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the outcome of people feeling heard, which is related to the topic of listening and its effects on relationships.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 12 is the most similar in terms of intent and content. It discusses the outcome of a challenge (although unrelated to listening) and its effects on people's behavior.

However, a closer match is not available. If I had to choose, I would say that Question 12 is the most similar, but with a low confidence score.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 12

Please note that this is not an exact match, and the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic (technology and phone usage) than the ground truth MCQ (listening and relationships).

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the benefits of being a good listener in situations where you disagree with the speaker. The correct option mentions that open-mindedness creates a less defensive environment.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 16 is the most similar in terms of intent and content. It discusses the relationship between technology and our attention, and option B mentions that technology is designed to get more attention from us. However, this is not a direct match.

A more relevant generated MCQ is not available in the provided options. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 13 is the most similar, as it discusses the effects of multitasking on the brain, which can be related to the concept of listening and attention.

But since none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest generating new MCQs that are more relevant to the topic of listening and attention.

If you would like, I can help generate new MCQs that are more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice. Practice is the repetition of an action
with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease,
speed, and confidence. So what does practice do in our brains
to make us better at things? Our brains have two kinds 
of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter. The grey matter processes information
in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli
to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up
of fatty tissue and nerve fibers. In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from
the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers
called axons to our muscles. So how does practice or repetition
affect the inner workings of our brains? The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance
called myelin. And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,
that seems to change with practice. Myelin is similar to insulation
on electrical cables. It prevents energy loss from electrical
signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently
along neural pathways. Some recent studies in mice suggest
that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath
that insulates the axons. And the more layers, the greater
the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway
for information connecting your brain to your muscles. So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes 
to muscle memory, muscles themselves 
don't really have memory. Rather, it may be the myelination
of neural pathways that gives these athletes 
and performers their edge with faster and more efficient 
neural pathways. There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours,
days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill. While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about
the amount of hours of practice. It's also the quality and effectiveness
of that practice. Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge 
of one's current abilities. So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most 
out of our practice time? Try these tips. Focus on the task at hand. Minimize potential distractions by turning
off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone 
on airplane mode. In one study, researchers observed 260
students studying. On average, those students were able to stay 
on task for only six minutes at a time. Laptops, smartphones, 
and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions. Start out slowly or in slow-motion. Coordination is built with repetitions,
whether correct or incorrect. If you gradually increase the speed
of the quality repetitons, you have a better chance 
of doing them correctly. Next, frequent repetitions with allotted
breaks are common practice habits of elite performers. Studies have shown that many top athletes,
musicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities
related to their craft. Many divide their time 
used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions
of limited duration. And finally, practice in your brain
in vivid detail. It's a bit surprising, but a number
of studies suggest that once a physical motion 
has been established, it can be reinforced 
just by imagining it. In one study, 144 basketball players
were divided into two groups. Group A physically practiced 
one-handed free throws while Group B only 
mentally practiced them. When they were tested at the end
of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced
players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount. As scientists get closer to unraveling
the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice
will only improve. In the meantime, effective practice
is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to the topic of hydration and water, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of practice and mastery.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match. This is because Question 2 has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question that asks about a specific concept and options that include a combination of answers (i.e., "All of the above").

But again, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease,
speed, and confidence. So what does practice do in our brains
to make us better at things? Our brains have two kinds 
of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter. The grey matter processes information
in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli
to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up
of fatty tissue and nerve fibers. In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from
the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers
called axons to our muscles. So how does practice or repetition
affect the inner workings of our brains? The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance
called myelin. And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,
that seems to change with practice. Myelin is similar to insulation
on electrical cables. It prevents energy loss from electrical
signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently
along neural pathways. Some recent studies in mice suggest
that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath
that insulates the axons. And the more layers, the greater
the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway
for information connecting your brain to your muscles. So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes 
to muscle memory, muscles themselves 
don't really have memory. Rather, it may be the myelination
of neural pathways that gives these athletes 
and performers their edge with faster and more efficient 
neural pathways. There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours,
days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill. While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about
the amount of hours of practice. It's also the quality and effectiveness
of that practice. Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge 
of one's current abilities. So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most 
out of our practice time? Try these tips. Focus on the task at hand. Minimize potential distractions by turning
off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone 
on airplane mode. In one study, researchers observed 260
students studying. On average, those students were able to stay 
on task for only six minutes at a time. Laptops, smartphones, 
and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions. Start out slowly or in slow-motion. Coordination is built with repetitions,
whether correct or incorrect. If you gradually increase the speed
of the quality repetitons, you have a better chance 
of doing them correctly. Next, frequent repetitions with allotted
breaks are common practice habits of elite performers. Studies have shown that many top athletes,
musicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities
related to their craft. Many divide their time 
used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions
of limited duration. And finally, practice in your brain
in vivid detail. It's a bit surprising, but a number
of studies suggest that once a physical motion 
has been established, it can be reinforced 
just by imagining it. In one study, 144 basketball players
were divided into two groups. Group A physically practiced 
one-handed free throws while Group B only 
mentally practiced them. When they were tested at the end
of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced
players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount. As scientists get closer to unraveling
the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice
will only improve. In the meantime, effective practice
is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, specifically hydration and water intake, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to practice habits of successful athletes and performers.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 10 is the closest match. This is because Question 10 has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question that asks about a specific topic and options that include "All of the above" as the correct answer.

But again, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent, and Question 10 is only a match in terms of format and structure.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, 
they are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65%
by their first birthday. So what role does water 
play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink
to stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion
and lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost
three quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount
of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones
are 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters
through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing. While these functions 
are essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level
is essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating
effects on overall health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors 
in the brain's hypothalamus signal the release 
of antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, 
it creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood
to absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause
notable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder 
to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks
because of its lack of water. Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption
of water in a short amount of time. Athletes are often the victims 
of over-hydration because of complications 
in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain amps
up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows,
or even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body
become diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with 
the resulting volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures
or death. But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system
is easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough 
to have access to clean drinking water. For a long time, conventional wisdom said
that we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned. Now, the consensus is that the amount
of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight
and environment. The recommended daily intake varies from
between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up 
or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine 
like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And water within food makes up 
about a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while
providing valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have various
long-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration
can lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk
of certain types of cancer. No matter what, getting the right amount
of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.

**Transcript**:
Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, 
they are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65%
by their first birthday. So what role does water 
play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink
to stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion
and lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost
three quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount
of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones
are 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters
through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing. While these functions 
are essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level
is essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating
effects on overall health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors 
in the brain's hypothalamus signal the release 
of antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, 
it creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood
to absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause
notable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder 
to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks
because of its lack of water. Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption
of water in a short amount of time. Athletes are often the victims 
of over-hydration because of complications 
in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain amps
up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows,
or even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body
become diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with 
the resulting volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures
or death. But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system
is easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough 
to have access to clean drinking water. For a long time, conventional wisdom said
that we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned. Now, the consensus is that the amount
of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight
and environment. The recommended daily intake varies from
between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up 
or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine 
like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And water within food makes up 
about a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while
providing valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have various
long-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration
can lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk
of certain types of cancer. No matter what, getting the right amount
of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.

**Transcript**:
Each year in the United States, players of sports 
and recreational activities receive between 2.5 
and 4 million concussions. How dangerous are all those concussions? The answer is complicated, and lies in how the brain responds
when something strikes it. The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,
with a consistency something like jello. Inside its protective membranes
and the skull's hard casing, this delicate organ 
is usually well-shielded. But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against 
the skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue
isn't uniform. It's made of a vast network
of 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long
axons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. This spindly structure makes 
them very fragile so that when impacted, neurons
will stretch and even tear. That not only disrupts their ability
to communicate but as destroyed axons begin
to degenerate, they also release toxins
causing the death of other neurons, too. This combination of events causes
a concussion. The damage can manifest 
in many different ways including blackout, headache, blurry vision, balance problems, altered mood and behavior, problems with memory, 
thinking, and sleeping, and the onset of anxiety and depression. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences
of concussions vary so widely. Luckily, the majority of concussions
fully heal and symptoms disappear
within a matter of days or weeks. Lots of rest and a gradual return
to activity allows the brain to heal itself. On the subject of rest, many people have heard that
you're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concussion
because you might slip into a coma. That's a myth. So long as doctors aren't concerned there
may also be a more severe brain injury, like a brain bleed, there's no documented problem with
going to sleep after a concussion. Sometimes, victims of concussion can
experience something called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS. People with PCS may experience
constant headaches, learning difficulties, and behavioral symptoms that even
affect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury. Trying to play through a concussion,
even for only a few minutes, or returning to sports too soon
after a concussion, makes it more likely to develop PCS. In some cases, a concussion 
can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly
over time. That's often true of 
subconcussive impacts which result from lower impact jolts
to the head than those that cause concussions. This category of injury doesn't cause
noticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative
brain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Take soccer players, who are known
for repeatedly heading soccer balls. Using a technique called
Diffusion Tensor Imaging, we're beginning to find out what effect
that has on the brain. This method allows scientists to find
large axon bundles and see how milder blows
might alter them structurally. In 2013, researchers using 
this technique discovered that athletes who had 
headed the ball most, about 1,800 times a year, had damaged the structural integrity
of their axon bundles. The damage was similar to how
a rope will fail when the individual fibers start to fray. Those players also performed worse
on short-term memory tests, so even though no one suffered
full-blown concussions, these subconcussive hits added up
to measurable damage over time. In fact, researchers know that an
overload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease
known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. People with CTE suffer from changes
in their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s followed by problems with thinking
and memory that can, in some cases, even result
in dementia. The culprit is a protein called tau. Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes
inside our axons called microtubules. It's thought that repeated subconcussive
hits damage the microtubules, causing the tau proteins to dislodge
and clump together. The clumps disrupt transport
and communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connections
within the brain. Once the tau proteins 
start clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread 
throughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. The data show that at least
among football players, between 50 and 80% of concussions
go unreported and untreated. Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell a concussion has occurred 
in the first place. But it's also often due to pressure
or a desire to keep going despite the fact that something's wrong. This doesn't just undermine recovery. It's also dangerous. Our brains aren't invincible. They still need us to shield 
them from harm and help them undo damage
once it's been done.

**Transcript**:
Each year in the United States, players of sports 
and recreational activities receive between 2.5 
and 4 million concussions. How dangerous are all those concussions? The answer is complicated, and lies in how the brain responds
when something strikes it. The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,
with a consistency something like jello. Inside its protective membranes
and the skull's hard casing, this delicate organ 
is usually well-shielded. But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against 
the skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue
isn't uniform. It's made of a vast network
of 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long
axons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. This spindly structure makes 
them very fragile so that when impacted, neurons
will stretch and even tear. That not only disrupts their ability
to communicate but as destroyed axons begin
to degenerate, they also release toxins
causing the death of other neurons, too. This combination of events causes
a concussion. The damage can manifest 
in many different ways including blackout, headache, blurry vision, balance problems, altered mood and behavior, problems with memory, 
thinking, and sleeping, and the onset of anxiety and depression. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences
of concussions vary so widely. Luckily, the majority of concussions
fully heal and symptoms disappear
within a matter of days or weeks. Lots of rest and a gradual return
to activity allows the brain to heal itself. On the subject of rest, many people have heard that
you're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concussion
because you might slip into a coma. That's a myth. So long as doctors aren't concerned there
may also be a more severe brain injury, like a brain bleed, there's no documented problem with
going to sleep after a concussion. Sometimes, victims of concussion can
experience something called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS. People with PCS may experience
constant headaches, learning difficulties, and behavioral symptoms that even
affect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury. Trying to play through a concussion,
even for only a few minutes, or returning to sports too soon
after a concussion, makes it more likely to develop PCS. In some cases, a concussion 
can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly
over time. That's often true of 
subconcussive impacts which result from lower impact jolts
to the head than those that cause concussions. This category of injury doesn't cause
noticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative
brain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Take soccer players, who are known
for repeatedly heading soccer balls. Using a technique called
Diffusion Tensor Imaging, we're beginning to find out what effect
that has on the brain. This method allows scientists to find
large axon bundles and see how milder blows
might alter them structurally. In 2013, researchers using 
this technique discovered that athletes who had 
headed the ball most, about 1,800 times a year, had damaged the structural integrity
of their axon bundles. The damage was similar to how
a rope will fail when the individual fibers start to fray. Those players also performed worse
on short-term memory tests, so even though no one suffered
full-blown concussions, these subconcussive hits added up
to measurable damage over time. In fact, researchers know that an
overload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease
known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. People with CTE suffer from changes
in their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s followed by problems with thinking
and memory that can, in some cases, even result
in dementia. The culprit is a protein called tau. Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes
inside our axons called microtubules. It's thought that repeated subconcussive
hits damage the microtubules, causing the tau proteins to dislodge
and clump together. The clumps disrupt transport
and communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connections
within the brain. Once the tau proteins 
start clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread 
throughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. The data show that at least
among football players, between 50 and 80% of concussions
go unreported and untreated. Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell a concussion has occurred 
in the first place. But it's also often due to pressure
or a desire to keep going despite the fact that something's wrong. This doesn't just undermine recovery. It's also dangerous. Our brains aren't invincible. They still need us to shield 
them from harm and help them undo damage
once it's been done.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as debate, intellectual humility, and public discourse, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to concussions.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 6: **Evaluation** is the closest match. This question has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question that requires evaluation and options that present different statements. However, the content and intent of the question are still quite different.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, it would be Question 6: **Evaluation**.

Index: 6 (Note: This is not a good match, and a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of concussions would be needed to find a suitable match.)

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as debate, intellectual humility, and public discourse, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and its causes and effects.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 4: **Analysis** is the closest match. This question asks about the relationship between two concepts, which is similar to the ground truth MCQ that asks about the statements related to CTE. However, the content and options of Question 4 are not related to CTE or concussions.

Therefore, I would say that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of concussions and CTE would be needed to find a match.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Across the whole planet, humans eat on average between
one and 2.7 kilograms of food a day. That's over 365 kilograms 
a year per person, and more than 28,800 kilograms
over the course of a lifetime. And every last scrap makes its way
through the digestive system. Comprised of ten organs 
covering nine meters, and containing 
over 20 specialized cell types, this is one of the most diverse
and complicated systems in the human body. Its parts continuously work in unison
to fulfill a singular task: transforming the raw materials
of your food into the nutrients and energy
that keep you alive. Spanning the entire length of your torso, the digestive system 
has four main components. First, there's the gastrointestinal tract, a twisting channel 
that transports your food and has an internal surface area
of between 30 and 40 square meters, enough to cover half a badminton court. Second, there's the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver, a trio of organs that break down food
using an array of special juices. Third, the body's enzymes, hormones, nerves, and blood all work together to break down food, modulate the digestive process, and deliver its final products. Finally, there's the mesentery, a large stretch of tissue that supports and positions all your digestive organs 
in the abdomen, enabling them to do their jobs. The digestive process begins
before food even hits your tongue. Anticipating a tasty morsel, glands in your mouth start 
to pump out saliva. We produce about 1.5 liters
of this liquid each day. Once inside your mouth, chewing combines with the sloshing saliva to turn food into a moist lump 
called the bolus. Enzymes present in the saliva
break down any starch. Then, your food finds itself at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube 
called the esophagus, down which it must plunge 
to reach the stomach. Nerves in the surrounding 
esophageal tissue sense the bolus's presence 
and trigger peristalsis, a series of defined muscular contractions. That propels the food into the stomach, where it's left at the mercy
of the muscular stomach walls, which bound the bolus, 
breaking it into chunks. Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining,
trigger the release of acids and enzyme-rich juices 
from the stomach wall that start to dissolve the food
and break down its proteins. These hormones also alert the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to produce digestive juices and transfer bile, a yellowish-green 
liquid that digests fat, in preparation for the next stage. After three hours inside the stomach, the once shapely bolus is now
a frothy liquid called chyme, and it's ready to move into
the small intestine. The liver sends bile 
to the gallbladder, which secretes it into the first portion of
the small intestine called the duodenum. Here, it dissolves the fats
floating in the slurry of chyme so they can be easily digested
by the pancreatic and intestinal juices that have leached onto the scene. These enzyme-rich juices break the fat
molecules down into fatty acids and glycerol for easier 
absorption into the body. The enzymes also carry out 
the final deconstruction of proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose. This happens in the 
small intestine's lower regions, the jejunum and ileum, which are coated in millions 
of tiny projections called villi. These create a huge surface area
to maximize molecule absorption and transference into the blood stream. The blood takes them on the final
leg of their journey to feed the body's organs and tissues. But it's not over quite yet. Leftover fiber, water, and dead cells 
sloughed off during digestion make it into the large intestine,
also known as the colon. The body drains out most of the remaining
fluid through the intestinal wall. What's left is a soft mass called stool. The colon squeezes this byproduct
into a pouch called the rectum, where nerves sense it expanding and tell the body when 
it's time to expel the waste. The byproducts of digestion
exit through the anus and the food's long journey, typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours, is finally complete.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Across the whole planet, humans eat on average between
one and 2.7 kilograms of food a day. That's over 365 kilograms 
a year per person, and more than 28,800 kilograms
over the course of a lifetime. And every last scrap makes its way
through the digestive system. Comprised of ten organs 
covering nine meters, and containing 
over 20 specialized cell types, this is one of the most diverse
and complicated systems in the human body. Its parts continuously work in unison
to fulfill a singular task: transforming the raw materials
of your food into the nutrients and energy
that keep you alive. Spanning the entire length of your torso, the digestive system 
has four main components. First, there's the gastrointestinal tract, a twisting channel 
that transports your food and has an internal surface area
of between 30 and 40 square meters, enough to cover half a badminton court. Second, there's the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver, a trio of organs that break down food
using an array of special juices. Third, the body's enzymes, hormones, nerves, and blood all work together to break down food, modulate the digestive process, and deliver its final products. Finally, there's the mesentery, a large stretch of tissue that supports and positions all your digestive organs 
in the abdomen, enabling them to do their jobs. The digestive process begins
before food even hits your tongue. Anticipating a tasty morsel, glands in your mouth start 
to pump out saliva. We produce about 1.5 liters
of this liquid each day. Once inside your mouth, chewing combines with the sloshing saliva to turn food into a moist lump 
called the bolus. Enzymes present in the saliva
break down any starch. Then, your food finds itself at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube 
called the esophagus, down which it must plunge 
to reach the stomach. Nerves in the surrounding 
esophageal tissue sense the bolus's presence 
and trigger peristalsis, a series of defined muscular contractions. That propels the food into the stomach, where it's left at the mercy
of the muscular stomach walls, which bound the bolus, 
breaking it into chunks. Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining,
trigger the release of acids and enzyme-rich juices 
from the stomach wall that start to dissolve the food
and break down its proteins. These hormones also alert the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to produce digestive juices and transfer bile, a yellowish-green 
liquid that digests fat, in preparation for the next stage. After three hours inside the stomach, the once shapely bolus is now
a frothy liquid called chyme, and it's ready to move into
the small intestine. The liver sends bile 
to the gallbladder, which secretes it into the first portion of
the small intestine called the duodenum. Here, it dissolves the fats
floating in the slurry of chyme so they can be easily digested
by the pancreatic and intestinal juices that have leached onto the scene. These enzyme-rich juices break the fat
molecules down into fatty acids and glycerol for easier 
absorption into the body. The enzymes also carry out 
the final deconstruction of proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose. This happens in the 
small intestine's lower regions, the jejunum and ileum, which are coated in millions 
of tiny projections called villi. These create a huge surface area
to maximize molecule absorption and transference into the blood stream. The blood takes them on the final
leg of their journey to feed the body's organs and tissues. But it's not over quite yet. Leftover fiber, water, and dead cells 
sloughed off during digestion make it into the large intestine,
also known as the colon. The body drains out most of the remaining
fluid through the intestinal wall. What's left is a soft mass called stool. The colon squeezes this byproduct
into a pouch called the rectum, where nerves sense it expanding and tell the body when 
it's time to expel the waste. The byproducts of digestion
exit through the anus and the food's long journey, typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours, is finally complete.

Finally, there's the mesentery, a large stretch of tissue that supports and positions all your digestive organs 
in the abdomen, enabling them to do their jobs. The digestive process begins
before food even hits your tongue. Anticipating a tasty morsel, glands in your mouth start 
to pump out saliva. We produce about 1.5 liters
of this liquid each day. Once inside your mouth, chewing combines with the sloshing saliva to turn food into a moist lump 
called the bolus. Enzymes present in the saliva
break down any starch. Then, your food finds itself at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube 
called the esophagus, down which it must plunge 
to reach the stomach. Nerves in the surrounding 
esophageal tissue sense the bolus's presence 
and trigger peristalsis, a series of defined muscular contractions. That propels the food into the stomach, where it's left at the mercy
of the muscular stomach walls, which bound the bolus, 
breaking it into chunks. Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining,
trigger the release of acids and enzyme-rich juices 
from the stomach wall that start to dissolve the food
and break down its proteins. These hormones also alert the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to produce digestive juices and transfer bile, a yellowish-green 
liquid that digests fat, in preparation for the next stage. After three hours inside the stomach, the once shapely bolus is now
a frothy liquid called chyme, and it's ready to move into
the small intestine. The liver sends bile 
to the gallbladder, which secretes it into the first portion of
the small intestine called the duodenum. Here, it dissolves the fats
floating in the slurry of chyme so they can be easily digested
by the pancreatic and intestinal juices that have leached onto the scene. These enzyme-rich juices break the fat
molecules down into fatty acids and glycerol for easier 
absorption into the body. The enzymes also carry out 
the final deconstruction of proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose. This happens in the 
small intestine's lower regions, the jejunum and ileum, which are coated in millions 
of tiny projections called villi. These create a huge surface area
to maximize molecule absorption and transference into the blood stream. The blood takes them on the final
leg of their journey to feed the body's organs and tissues. But it's not over quite yet. Leftover fiber, water, and dead cells 
sloughed off during digestion make it into the large intestine,
also known as the colon. The body drains out most of the remaining
fluid through the intestinal wall. What's left is a soft mass called stool. The colon squeezes this byproduct
into a pouch called the rectum, where nerves sense it expanding and tell the body when 
it's time to expel the waste. The byproducts of digestion
exit through the anus and the food's long journey, typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours, is finally complete.

Transcriber: TED Translators Admin
Reviewer: Camille Martínez TED has already persuaded me
to change my life in one small way, by persuading me to change
the opening of my speech. I love this idea of engagement. So, when you leave here today, I'm going to ask you
to engage or re-engage with some of the most important
people in your lives: your brothers and sisters. It can be a profoundly
life-affirming thing to do, even if it isn't always easy. This is a man named Elliot, for whom things were very difficult. Elliot was a drunk. He spent most of his life
battling alcoholism, depression, morphine addiction, and that life ended
when he was just 34 years old. What made things harder for Elliot
is that his last name was Roosevelt. And he could never quite
get past the comparisons with his big brother Teddy, for whom things always seemed
to come a little bit easier. It wasn't easy being Bobby, either. He was also the sibling of a president. But he adored his brother, Jack. He fought for him, he worked for him. And when Jack died, he bled for him, too. In the years that followed,
Bobby would smile, but it seemed labored. He'd lose himself in his work, but it seemed tortured. Bobby's own death, so similar to John's, seems somehow fitting. John Kennedy was robbed of his young life; Bobby seemed almost
to have been relieved of his. There may be no relationship
that effects us more profoundly, that's closer, finer, harder, sweeter, happier, sadder, more filled with joy or fraught with woe than the relationship we have
with our brothers and sisters. There's power in the sibling bond. There's pageantry. There's petulance, too, as when Neil Bush, sibling of both a president
and a governor, famously griped, "I've lost patience for being compared
to my older brothers," as if Jeb and George W
were somehow responsible for the savings and loan scandal
and the messy divorce that marked Neil in the public eye. But more important
than all of these things, the sibling bond can be
a thing of abiding love. Our parents leave us too early, our spouse and our children
come along too late. Our siblings are the only ones
who are with us for the entire ride. Over the arc of decades,
there may be nothing that defines us and forms us
more powerfully than our relationship
with our sisters and brothers. It was true for me, it's true for your children and if you have siblings,
it's true for you, too. This picture was taken when Steve,
on the left, was eight years old. I was six, our brother Gary was five
and my brother Bruce was four. I will not say what year it was taken. It was not this year. (Laughter) I open my new book, "The Sibling Effect," on a Saturday morning, not long before this picture was taken, when the three older brothers decided
that it might be a very good idea to lock the younger brother
in a fuse cabinet in our playroom. (Laughter) We were, believe it or not,
trying to keep him safe. Our father was a hotheaded man, somebody who didn't take kindly
to being disturbed on Saturday mornings. I don't know what he thought his life
would be like on Saturday mornings when he had four sons, ages four years old or younger
when the youngest one was born, but they weren't quiet. He did not take to that well. And he would react to being
disturbed on a Saturday morning by stalking into the playroom and administering a very freewheeling
form of a corporal punishment, lashing out at whoever
was within arms' reach. We were by no means battered children
but we did get hit, and we found it terrifying. So we devised a sort of
scatter-and-hide drill. (Laughter) As soon as we saw or heard
the footsteps coming, Steve, the oldest, would wriggle
under the couch, I would dive into the closet
in the playroom, Gary would dive into
a window-seat toy chest, but not before we closed
Bruce inside the fuse box. We told him it was
Alan Shepard's space capsule, and that somehow made it work better. (Laughter) I dare say my father was never
fooled by this ruse. And it was only in later
years that I began to think perhaps it wasn't a good idea
to squeeze a four-year-old up against a panel of old-style,
un-screwable high-voltage fuses. (Laughter) But my brothers and I,
even through those unhappy times, came through them, with something
that was clear and hard and fine: a primal appreciation
for the bond we shared. We were a unit -- a loud, messy brawling, loyal, loving, lasting unit. We felt much stronger that way
than we ever could as individuals. And we knew that as our lives went on, we could always be able
to call on that strength. We're not alone. Until 15 years ago, scientists didn't really pay much
attention to the sibling bond. And with good reason: you have just one mother,
you have just one father if you do marriage right,
you have one spouse for life. Siblings can claim
none of that uniqueness. They're interchangeable, fungible,
a kind of household commodity. Parents set up shop and begin stocking
their shelves with inventory, the only limitation being sperm,
egg and economics. (Laughter) As long as you can keep breathing,
you may as well keep stocking. Now, nature is perfectly happy
with that arrangement, because our primal directive here is to get as many of our genes
as possible into the next generation. Animals wrestle with
these same issues, too, but they have a more straightforward way
of dealing with things. A crested penguin that has laid two eggs
will take a good look at them and boot the smaller one out of the nest, the better to focus her attentions
on the presumably heartier chick in the bigger shell. A black eagle will allow
all of her chicks to hatch and then stand back while the bigger ones
fight it out with the little ones, typically ripping them to ribbons and then settling back
to grow up in peace. Piglets, cute as they are, are born with a strange
little outward set of pointing teeth, that they use to jab at one another as they compete
for the choicest nursing spots. The problem for scientists was that this whole idea of siblings
as second-class citizens never really seemed to hold up. After the researchers
had learned all they could from the relationships in the family,
mothers and other relationships, they still came up with some
temperamental dark matter that was pulling at us, exerting a gravity all its own. And that could only be our siblings. Humans are no different from animals. After we are born, we do whatever we can to attract the attention of our parents, determining what our strongest
selling points are and marketing them ferociously. Someone's the funny one,
someone's the pretty one, someone's the athlete,
someone's the smart one. Scientists call this "deidentification." If my older brother
is a high-school football player -- which, if you saw my older
brother, you'd know he was not -- I could become a high-school
football player, too and get at most 50 percent of the applause
in my family for doing that. Or, I could become student
council president or specialize in the arts and get 100 percent
of the attention in that area. Sometimes parents contaminate
the deidentification process, communicating to their kids subtly or not, that only certain kinds of accomplishments
will be applauded in the home. Joe Kennedy was famous for this, making it clear to his nine children that they were expected to compete
with one another in athletics and were expected to win, lest they be made to eat
in the kitchen with the help, rather than in the dining room
with the family. It's no wonder that scrawny second-born Jack Kennedy
fought so hard to compete with his fitter firstborn brother, Joe, often at his peril, at one point, engaging
in a bicycle race around the house that resulted in a collision
costing John 28 stitches. Joe walked away essentially unharmed. Parents exacerbate this problem further when they exhibit favoritism, which they do overwhelmingly,
no matter how much they admit it. A study I cite in this TIME magazine
covering in the book "The Sibling Effect," found 70 percent of fathers
and 65 percent of mothers exhibit a preference
for at least one child. And keep in mind here --
the keyword is "exhibit." The remaining parents may simply be doing
a better job of concealing things. (Laughter) I like to say that 95 percent
of all parents have a favorite, five percent are lying about it. The exception is my wife and me. Honestly, we do not have a favorite. (Laughter) It's not parents' fault that they harbor
feelings of favoritism. And here, too, our natural
wiring is at work. Firstborns are the first products
on the familial assembly line. Parents typically get two years
of investing dollars, calories and so many other resources in them, so that by the time
the second born comes along, the firstborn is already ...
it's what corporations call "sunk costs," you don't want to disinvest in this one and launch the R&D on the new product. (Laughter) So what we begin to do is say,
"I'm going to lean to the Mac OS X and let the Mac OS XI come out
in a couple of years." So we tend to lean in that direction. (Laughter) But there are other forces at work, too. One of the same studies I looked at
both here and in the book found that, improbably, the most common favorite
for a father is the last-born daughter. The most common favorite
for a mother is the firstborn son. Now, this isn't Oedipal; never mind
what the Freudians would have told us a hundred years ago. And it's not just that fathers
are habitually wrapped around the fingers of their little girls, though I can tell you that,
as the father of two girls, that part definitely plays a role. Rather, there is a certain
reproductive narcissism at work. Your opposite-gender kids can never resemble you exactly. But if somehow they can resemble
you temperamentally, you'll love them all the more. As the result, the father
who is a businessman will just melt at the idea of his MBA daughter
with a tough-as-nails worldview. The mother who is a sensitive type
will go gooey over her son the poet. (Laughter) Birth order, another topic
I covered for TIME, and another topic I cover in the book, plays out in other ways as well. Long before scientists
began looking at this, parents noticed that there are
certain temperamental templates associated with all birth rankings: the serious, striving firstborn; the caught-in-a-thicket's middle born; the wild child of a last born. And once again, when science
did crack this field, they found out mom and dad are right. Firstborns across history have tended
to be bigger and healthier than later borns, in part, because of the head start
they got on food in an area in which it could be scarce. Firstborns are also
vaccinated more reliably and tend to have more
follow-up visits to doctors when they get sick. And this pattern continues today. This IQ question is, sadly -- I can
say this as a second-born -- a very real thing. Firstborns have a three-point
IQ advantage over second borns and second borns have a 1.5 IQ
advantage over later borns, partly because of the exclusive attention
firstborns get from mom and dad, and partly because they get a chance
to mentor the younger kids. All of this explains why firstborns
are likelier to be CEOs, they are likelier to be senators, they are likelier to be astronauts, and they are likelier to earn more
than other kids are. Last borns come into the world
with a whole different set of challenges. The smallest and weakest cubs in the den, they're at the greatest risk
of getting eaten alive, so they have to develop
what are called "low-power skills" -- the ability to charm and disarm, to intuit what's going on
in someone else's head, the better to duck
the punch before it lands. (Laughter) They're also flat-out funnier, which is another thing
that comes in handy, because a person who's making you laugh
is a very hard person to slug. (Laughter) It's perhaps no coincidence
that over the course of history, some of our greatest satirists -- Swift, Twain, Voltaire, Colbert -- (Laughter) are either the last borns or among the last in very large families. Most middle borns don't get
quite as sweet a deal. I think of us as the flyover states. We are -- (Laughter) we're the ones who fight harder
for recognition in the home. We're the ones who are always
raising our hands while someone else at the table
is getting called on. We're the ones who tend
to take a little longer to find their direction in life. And there can be self-esteem
issues associated with that, notwithstanding the fact
that I've been asked to do TED, so I feel much better
about these things right now. (Laughter) But the upside for middle borns
is that they also tend to develop denser and richer relationships
outside the home. But that advantage comes also
from something of a disadvantage, simply because their needs
weren't met as well in the home. The feuds in the playroom
that play out over favoritism, birth order and so many other issues are as unrelenting as they seem. In one study I cite in the book, children in the two-to-four age group engage in one fight every 6.3 minutes, or 9.5 fights an hour. That's not fighting --
that's performance art. (Laughter) That's extraordinary. One reason for this is that there are
a lot more people in your home than you think there are, or at least a lot more relationships. Every person in your house has
a discrete one-on-one relationship with every other person, and those pairings or dyads add up fast. In a family with two parents and two kids,
there are six dyads: Mom has a relationship with child A and B, Dad has a relationship with child A and B. There's the marital relationship, and there is the relationship
between the kids themselves. The formula for this
looks very chilly but it's real. K equals the number of people
in your household, and X equals the number of dyads. In a five-person family,
there are ten discrete dyads. The eight-person Brady Bunch --
never mind the sweetness here -- there were 28 dyads in that family. The original Kennedy family with nine kids
had 55 different relationships. And Bobby Kennedy, who grew up
to have 11 children of his own, had a household with a whopping 91 dyads. This overpopulation of relationships makes fights unavoidable. And far and away the biggest trigger
for all sibling fights is property. Studies have found that over 95 percent
of the fights among small children concern somebody touching, playing with, looking at the other person's stuff. (Laughter) This in its own way is healthy
if it's very noisy, and the reason is that small children
come into the world with absolutely no control. They are utterly helpless. The only way they have
of projecting their very limited power is through the objects
they can call their own. When somebody crosses
that very erasable line, they're going to go nuts,
and that's what happens. Another very common casus belli
among children is the idea of fairness, as any parent who hears 14 times a day,
"But that's unfair!" can tell you. In a way this is good, too, though. Kids are born with a very innate sense
of right and wrong, of a fair deal versus an unfair one, and this teaches them powerful lessons. Do you want to know how powerfully encoded
fairness is in the human genome? We process that phenomenon through the same lobe in our brain
that processes disgust, meaning we react to the idea
of somebody being cheated the same way we react to putrefied meat. (Laughter) Any wonder that this fellow,
Bernie Madoff, is unpopular? All of these dramas played out day to day, moment to moment, serve as a real-time,
total-immersion exercise for life. Siblings teach each other conflict
avoidance and conflict resolution, when to stand up for themselves, when to stand down; they learn love, loyalty, honesty, sharing,
caring, compromise, the disclosure of secrets
and much more important, the keeping of confidences. I listen to my young daughters --
aren’t they adorable? -- I listen to my young daughters
talking late into the night, the same way my parents, no doubt,
listened to my brothers and me talking, and sometimes I intervene,
but usually I don't. They're part of a conversation
I am not part of, nobody else in the world is part of, and it's a conversation
that can and should go on for the rest of their lives. From this will come a sense of constancy, a sense of having a permanent
traveling companion, somebody with whom they road-tested life before they ever had to get out
and travel it on their own. Brothers and sisters aren't
the sine qua non of a happy life; plenty of adult sibling
relationships are fatally broken and need to be abandoned
for the sanity of everybody involved. And only-children, throughout history,
have shown themselves to be creatively, brilliantly capable of getting their socialization
and comradeship skills through friends, through cousins,
through classmates. But having siblings and not
making the most of those bonds is, I believe, folly of the first order. If relationships are broken
and are fixable, fix them. If they work, make them even better. Failing to do so is a little like having
a thousand acres of fertile farmland and never planting it. Yes, you can always get your food
at the supermarket, but think what you're
allowing to lie fallow. Life is short, it's finite,
and it plays for keeps. Siblings may be among the richest harvests
of the time we have here. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers 
living in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this 
strange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became 
the building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, 
ripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia 
of dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic
people an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, 
fats, and minerals. But it also contained high 
quantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for 
many ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese, however, could provide all of 
milk’s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved 
and stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines 
and long winters. Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments 
found in Turkey still contain telltale residues of 
the cheese and butter they held. By the end of the Bronze Age, cheese was a standard commodity 
in maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean. In the densely populated city-states of 
Mesopotamia, cheese became a staple 
of culinary and religious life. Some of the earliest known writing includes administrative records 
of cheese quotas, listing a variety of cheeses for different
rituals and populations across Mesopotamia. Records from nearby civilizations 
in Turkey also reference rennet. This animal byproduct, produced in the
stomachs of certain mammals, can accelerate and control coagulation. Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking
tool spread around the globe, giving way to a wide variety of new, 
harder cheeses. And though some conservative food 
cultures rejected the dairy delicacy, many more embraced cheese, and quickly
added their own local flavors. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to
create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage 
cheese, straining the whey with reed mats. In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a
variety of food acids, such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer. This soft mild cheese could be added to 
curries and sauces, or simply fried as a 
quick vegetarian dish. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined
feta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano. This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean. Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,” became an essential ration for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire. And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed, cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside. In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries
scattered across Europe, medieval monks experimented endlessly 
with different types of milk, cheesemaking practices, and aging processes that led to many 
of today’s popular cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster 
and several Swiss types were all refined and perfected 
by these cheesemaking clergymen. In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was
particularly successful – producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses. By the end of the 14th century, Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands to take control of the growing 
cheese trade. Cheese remained popular through 
the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution took 
production out of the monastery and into machinery. Today, the world produces roughly 
22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. But 10,000 years after its invention, local farms are still following in the

**Transcript**:
Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers 
living in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this 
strange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became 
the building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, 
ripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia 
of dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic
people an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, 
fats, and minerals. But it also contained high 
quantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for 
many ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese, however, could provide all of 
milk’s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved 
and stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines 
and long winters. Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments 
found in Turkey still contain telltale residues of 
the cheese and butter they held. By the end of the Bronze Age, cheese was a standard commodity 
in maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean. In the densely populated city-states of 
Mesopotamia, cheese became a staple 
of culinary and religious life. Some of the earliest known writing includes administrative records 
of cheese quotas, listing a variety of cheeses for different
rituals and populations across Mesopotamia. Records from nearby civilizations 
in Turkey also reference rennet. This animal byproduct, produced in the
stomachs of certain mammals, can accelerate and control coagulation. Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking
tool spread around the globe, giving way to a wide variety of new, 
harder cheeses. And though some conservative food 
cultures rejected the dairy delicacy, many more embraced cheese, and quickly
added their own local flavors. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to
create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage 
cheese, straining the whey with reed mats. In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a
variety of food acids, such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer. This soft mild cheese could be added to 
curries and sauces, or simply fried as a 
quick vegetarian dish. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined
feta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano. This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean. Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,” became an essential ration for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire. And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed, cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside. In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries
scattered across Europe, medieval monks experimented endlessly 
with different types of milk, cheesemaking practices, and aging processes that led to many 
of today’s popular cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster 
and several Swiss types were all refined and perfected 
by these cheesemaking clergymen. In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was
particularly successful – producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses. By the end of the 14th century, Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands to take control of the growing

**Transcript**:
Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers 
living in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this 
strange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became 
the building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, 
ripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia 
of dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic
people an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, 
fats, and minerals. But it also contained high 
quantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for 
many ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese, however, could provide all of 
milk’s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved 
and stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines 
and long winters. Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments 
found in Turkey still contain telltale residues of 
the cheese and butter they held. By the end of the Bronze Age, cheese was a standard commodity 
in maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean. In the densely populated city-states of 
Mesopotamia, cheese became a staple 
of culinary and religious life. Some of the earliest known writing includes administrative records 
of cheese quotas, listing a variety of cheeses for different
rituals and populations across Mesopotamia. Records from nearby civilizations 
in Turkey also reference rennet. This animal byproduct, produced in the
stomachs of certain mammals, can accelerate and control coagulation. Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking
tool spread around the globe, giving way to a wide variety of new, 
harder cheeses. And though some conservative food 
cultures rejected the dairy delicacy, many more embraced cheese, and quickly
added their own local flavors. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to
create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage 
cheese, straining the whey with reed mats. In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a
variety of food acids, such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer. This soft mild cheese could be added to 
curries and sauces, or simply fried as a 
quick vegetarian dish. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined
feta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano. This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean. Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,” became an essential ration for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire. And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed, cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside. In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries
scattered across Europe, medieval monks experimented endlessly 
with different types of milk, cheesemaking practices, and aging processes that led to many 
of today’s popular cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster 
and several Swiss types were all refined and perfected 
by these cheesemaking clergymen. In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was
particularly successful – producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses. By the end of the 14th century, Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands to take control of the growing 
cheese trade. Cheese remained popular through 
the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution took 
production out of the monastery and into machinery. Today, the world produces roughly 
22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. But 10,000 years after its invention, local farms are still following in the 
footsteps of their Neolithic ancestors, hand crafting one of humanity’s 
oldest and favorite foods.

**Transcript**:
Late one night in 1871, a group of riders 
descended on a sleeping army camp. In minutes they stirred the camp 
into a panic, stole about 70 horses,
and disappeared. Led by a young chief 
named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest 
in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier 
between the indigenous people known as the Numunu, 
or Comanches, and the United States forces sent 
to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie 
led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel 
drew near his targets, they disappeared without 
a trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled 
this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages
around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican 
attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land 
by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ 
bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not 
one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, 
each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common 
was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child 
was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both 
other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area
with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie 
faced off. Born around 1848, Quanah 
was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, 
and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated
with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, 
capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought 
refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah 
proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young 
woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father 
and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing 
Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band 
was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast 
market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions 
of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led 
a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s 
1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, 
Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced 
certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah 
and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation 
in Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers,
they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life 
on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised
rations and supplies, but what they provided 
was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly 
in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power 
compared to others who had been 
on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect 
for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement 
leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights
with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income
for the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials
grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction 
of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges 
on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint 
one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed 
outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported 
Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders 
had supported him to lead them against 
the U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, 
Ranald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment. Quanah acted in Hollywood movies 
and befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s
inauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American 
Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, 
adopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down 
his mother and sister, eventually learning they had both 
died shortly after their capture. Quanah adapted again and again—
to different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem 
insurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, 
after Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official 
in the tribe, recognizing him 
as the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural 
survival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation
looks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens 
and countless descendants.

outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported 
Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders 
had supported him to lead them against 
the U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, 
Ranald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment. Quanah acted in Hollywood movies 
and befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s
inauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American 
Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, 
adopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down 
his mother and sister, eventually learning they had both 
died shortly after their capture. Quanah adapted again and again—
to different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem 
insurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, 
after Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official 
in the tribe, recognizing him 
as the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural 
survival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation
looks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens 
and countless descendants.

**Transcript**:
Late one night in 1871, a group of riders 
descended on a sleeping army camp. In minutes they stirred the camp 
into a panic, stole about 70 horses,
and disappeared. Led by a young chief 
named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest 
in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier 
between the indigenous people known as the Numunu, 
or Comanches, and the United States forces sent 
to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie 
led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel 
drew near his targets, they disappeared without 
a trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled 
this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages
around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican 
attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land 
by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ 
bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not 
one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, 
each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common 
was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child 
was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both 
other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area
with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie 
faced off. Born around 1848, Quanah 
was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, 
and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated
with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, 
capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought 
refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah 
proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young 
woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father 
and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing 
Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band 
was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast 
market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions 
of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led 
a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s 
1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, 
Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced 
certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah 
and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation 
in Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers,
they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life 
on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised
rations and supplies, but what they provided 
was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly 
in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power 
compared to others who had been 
on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect 
for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement 
leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights
with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income
for the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials
grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction 
of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges 
on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint 
one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed 
outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported 
Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders 
had supported him to lead them against

**Transcript**:
Baked or fried, boiled or roasted, as chips or fries. At some point in your life,
you've probably eaten a potato. Delicious, for sure, but the fact is potatoes have played a
much more significant role in our history than just that of the dietary staple
we have come to know and love today. Without the potato, our modern civilization 
might not exist at all. 8,000 years ago in South America,
high atop the Andes, ancient Peruvians were the first
to cultivate the potato. Containing high levels of proteins
and carbohydrates, as well as essential fats, vitamins
and minerals, potatoes were the perfect food source
to fuel a large Incan working class as they built and farmed 
their terraced fields, mined the Rocky Mountains, and created the sophisticated civilization
of the great Incan Empire. But considering how vital they were
to the Incan people, when Spanish sailors 
returning from the Andes first brought potatoes to Europe, the spuds were duds. Europeans simply didn't want to eat what they considered dull and tasteless
oddities from a strange new land, too closely related to the deadly
nightshade plant belladonna for comfort. So instead of consuming them, they used potatoes 
as decorative garden plants. More than 200 years would pass
before the potato caught on as a major food source throughout Europe, though even then, it was predominantly eaten 
by the lower classes. However, beginning around 1750, and thanks at least in part to the wide availability
of inexpensive and nutritious potatoes, European peasants 
with greater food security no longer found themselves at the mercy of the regularly 
occurring grain famines of the time, and so their populations steadily grew. As a result, the British, Dutch
and German Empires rose on the backs of the growing groups
of farmers, laborers, and soldiers, thus lifting the West to its place
of world dominion. However, not all European countries
sprouted empires. After the Irish adopted the potato, their population dramatically increased, as did their dependence on the tuber
as a major food staple. But then disaster struck. From 1845 to 1852, potato blight disease ravaged 
the majority of Ireland's potato crop, leading to the Irish Potato Famine, one of the deadliest famines
in world history. Over a million Irish citizens 
starved to death, and 2 million more 
left their homes behind. But of course, this wasn't the end
for the potato. The crop eventually recovered, and Europe's population,
especially the working classes, continued to increase. Aided by the influx of Irish migrants, Europe now had a large, sustainable,
and well-fed population who were capable of manning
the emerging factories that would bring about our modern world
via the Industrial Revolution. So it's almost impossible to imagine
a world without the potato. Would the Industrial Revolution 
ever have happened? Would World War II have been lost
by the Allies without this easy-to-grow crop
that fed the Allied troops? Would it even have started? When you think about it like this, many major milestones in world history
can all be at least partially attributed to the simple spud 
from the Peruvian hilltops.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the Incan civilization being aided by the potato's nutritional value, while the generated MCQs are about unrelated topics such as behavioral economics, health behavior, and a car accident.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 2 is the least dissimilar, but only because it mentions a speaker, and the ground truth MCQ is based on a transcript of a speaker. However, the content and options are completely unrelated.

So, my answer would be: None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 2, but with a strong caveat that it's not similar at all.

Index: 2 (with a strong caveat that it's not similar at all)

Matching Response:
After reviewing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not match the topic of the transcript, which is about the history and significance of potatoes. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as behavioral economics and health behavior.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of the transcript, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but only because it mentions a specific concept (present bias) and its relation to a particular field (health behavior), which is similar to how the ground truth MCQ mentions a specific concept (the potato's relation to a deadly plant species). However, the topics and question intents are still quite different.

Index: None (or 3, if I really had to choose one)

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it is the only one that mentions a specific date range, I would say:

None of the generated MCQs are similar, but if I had to choose, I would say Question 1 is the most similar, but only because it mentions a specific date (2007), not because the content or intent is similar.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" or "No match found".

**Transcript**:
Baked or fried, boiled or roasted, as chips or fries. At some point in your life,
you've probably eaten a potato. Delicious, for sure, but the fact is potatoes have played a
much more significant role in our history than just that of the dietary staple
we have come to know and love today. Without the potato, our modern civilization 
might not exist at all. 8,000 years ago in South America,
high atop the Andes, ancient Peruvians were the first
to cultivate the potato. Containing high levels of proteins
and carbohydrates, as well as essential fats, vitamins
and minerals, potatoes were the perfect food source
to fuel a large Incan working class as they built and farmed 
their terraced fields, mined the Rocky Mountains, and created the sophisticated civilization
of the great Incan Empire. But considering how vital they were
to the Incan people, when Spanish sailors 
returning from the Andes first brought potatoes to Europe, the spuds were duds. Europeans simply didn't want to eat what they considered dull and tasteless
oddities from a strange new land, too closely related to the deadly
nightshade plant belladonna for comfort. So instead of consuming them, they used potatoes 
as decorative garden plants. More than 200 years would pass
before the potato caught on as a major food source throughout Europe, though even then, it was predominantly eaten 
by the lower classes. However, beginning around 1750, and thanks at least in part to the wide availability
of inexpensive and nutritious potatoes, European peasants 
with greater food security no longer found themselves at the mercy of the regularly 
occurring grain famines of the time, and so their populations steadily grew. As a result, the British, Dutch
and German Empires rose on the backs of the growing groups
of farmers, laborers, and soldiers, thus lifting the West to its place
of world dominion. However, not all European countries
sprouted empires. After the Irish adopted the potato, their population dramatically increased, as did their dependence on the tuber
as a major food staple. But then disaster struck. From 1845 to 1852, potato blight disease ravaged 
the majority of Ireland's potato crop, leading to the Irish Potato Famine, one of the deadliest famines
in world history. Over a million Irish citizens 
starved to death, and 2 million more 
left their homes behind. But of course, this wasn't the end
for the potato. The crop eventually recovered, and Europe's population,
especially the working classes, continued to increase. Aided by the influx of Irish migrants, Europe now had a large, sustainable,
and well-fed population who were capable of manning
the emerging factories that would bring about our modern world
via the Industrial Revolution. So it's almost impossible to imagine
a world without the potato. Would the Industrial Revolution 
ever have happened? Would World War II have been lost
by the Allies without this easy-to-grow crop
that fed the Allied troops? Would it even have started? When you think about it like this, many major milestones in world history
can all be at least partially attributed to the simple spud 
from the Peruvian hilltops.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about the country that brought the potato to Europe. None of the generated MCQs are related to this topic. However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 11 is the least dissimilar, but only because it mentions a specific entity (a hospital setting) and a specific action (prescribing generic medications), similar to how the ground truth MCQ mentions a specific entity (a country) and a specific action (bringing the potato to Europe). However, please note that this is a very weak connection, and Question 11 is not similar to the ground truth MCQ in any meaningful way.

Index: 11 (but please note that this is not a good match)

**Transcript**:
Over the years, people have come 
up with some truly awful apologies. From classic non-apologies 
to evasive excuses, and flimsy corporate promises, it’s all too easy to give a bad apology. But researchers have found that good
apologies generally share certain elements and thoughtfully considering
these factors can help you make amends in a wide variety of situations. Since public apologies have their
own unique complications, we’re going to focus on some
person-to-person examples. So, picture this: your new office has
free ice cream sandwiches in the communal fridge— or at least that’s what you thought. But on Friday, when you’re helping
your co-worker Terence set up another colleague's birthday party, he finds that half the ice cream he bought
for the celebration is gone. While this is obviously 
an embarrassing accident, coming forward and apologizing 
is still the right thing to do. Understanding and accepting
responsibility for your actions is what some researchers call
the “centerpiece of an apology.” But it’s okay if this feels difficult
and vulnerable— it’s supposed to be! The costly nature of apologies is part
of what makes them meaningful. So while you might be tempted to defend
your actions as accidental, it’s important to remember 
that a good apology isn’t about making you feel better. It’s about seeking to understand 
the perspective of the wronged party and repair the damage 
to your relationship. This means that while clarifying your 
intentions non-defensively can be helpful, your mistake being an accident shouldn’t
absolve you from offering a sincere apology. But what if your mistake 
wasn’t an accident? Consider this: you promised your friend Marie that you’ll
attend her championship football match. But another friend just called
to offer you an extra ticket for your favorite musician's
farewell tour. You know this is 
a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and you can’t pass it up. Plus, you figure Marie wouldn’t
mind if you miss the game— she always has plenty of fans
supporting her. But the next day, Marie tells you 
she was really hurt when she didn’t see you in the crowd. You feel terrible for upsetting her 
and genuinely want to apologize. But while you regret hurting Marie, you’re not actually sure 
if you made the wrong choice. So how can you reach beyond
that terrible non-apology, “I’m sorry YOU feel this way”? In situations like this, it can be easy 
to focus on rationalizing your actions when you should be working to understand 
the other person’s perspective. Consider asking Marie 
how you made them feel to better understand your offense. In this case, Marie might explain 
that she was disappointed you broke your promise, and she was really counting 
on your support. This kind of clarity can help 
you recognize your wrongdoing and honestly accept how your actions
caused harm. Then you can frame your apology 
around addressing her concerns, perhaps by admitting that it was wrong
of you to break your promise, and you're sorry you weren't
there for her. Clearly acknowledging wrongdoing
indicates that you know exactly how you messed up, and it can give Marie faith that you’ll 
behave differently moving forward. But it’s always helpful to indicate 
exactly how you’ll change and what you’ll do to repair 
the damage caused by your offense. Researchers call this 
the “offer of repair,” and it's often rated as one of the most
critical parts of an apology. In some cases, these gestures
are straightforward, like offering to replace
the ice cream you eat. However, with less 
tangible transgressions, this might need to be more symbolic, like expressing your love and respect
for someone you wronged. One common offer of repair 
is a verbal commitment not to make the same mistake again, but promising to do better only works
if you actually do better. Taking the victim’s perspective, 
accepting responsibility, and making concrete offers of repair are just a few of the elements
of a good apology. But remember, apologies aren’t about
getting forgiveness and moving on; they’re about expressing remorse
and accepting accountability. And the best apologies are
just the first step on the road to reconciliation.

on your support. This kind of clarity can help 
you recognize your wrongdoing and honestly accept how your actions
caused harm. Then you can frame your apology 
around addressing her concerns, perhaps by admitting that it was wrong
of you to break your promise, and you're sorry you weren't
there for her. Clearly acknowledging wrongdoing
indicates that you know exactly how you messed up, and it can give Marie faith that you’ll 
behave differently moving forward. But it’s always helpful to indicate 
exactly how you’ll change and what you’ll do to repair 
the damage caused by your offense. Researchers call this 
the “offer of repair,” and it's often rated as one of the most
critical parts of an apology. In some cases, these gestures
are straightforward, like offering to replace
the ice cream you eat. However, with less 
tangible transgressions, this might need to be more symbolic, like expressing your love and respect
for someone you wronged. One common offer of repair 
is a verbal commitment not to make the same mistake again, but promising to do better only works
if you actually do better. Taking the victim’s perspective, 
accepting responsibility, and making concrete offers of repair are just a few of the elements
of a good apology. But remember, apologies aren’t about
getting forgiveness and moving on; they’re about expressing remorse
and accepting accountability. And the best apologies are
just the first step on the road to reconciliation.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as reactance theory, social networks, and romantic relationships, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the characteristics of a good apology.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the general theme of relationships and social interactions, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar, but only in the sense that it is the least dissimilar. However, please note that this is a very weak match, and the question intent, options, and content are still quite different.

**Transcript**:
Over the years, people have come 
up with some truly awful apologies. From classic non-apologies 
to evasive excuses, and flimsy corporate promises, it’s all too easy to give a bad apology. But researchers have found that good
apologies generally share certain elements and thoughtfully considering
these factors can help you make amends in a wide variety of situations. Since public apologies have their
own unique complications, we’re going to focus on some
person-to-person examples. So, picture this: your new office has
free ice cream sandwiches in the communal fridge— or at least that’s what you thought. But on Friday, when you’re helping
your co-worker Terence set up another colleague's birthday party, he finds that half the ice cream he bought
for the celebration is gone. While this is obviously 
an embarrassing accident, coming forward and apologizing 
is still the right thing to do. Understanding and accepting
responsibility for your actions is what some researchers call
the “centerpiece of an apology.” But it’s okay if this feels difficult
and vulnerable— it’s supposed to be! The costly nature of apologies is part
of what makes them meaningful. So while you might be tempted to defend
your actions as accidental, it’s important to remember 
that a good apology isn’t about making you feel better. It’s about seeking to understand 
the perspective of the wronged party and repair the damage 
to your relationship. This means that while clarifying your 
intentions non-defensively can be helpful, your mistake being an accident shouldn’t
absolve you from offering a sincere apology. But what if your mistake 
wasn’t an accident? Consider this: you promised your friend Marie that you’ll
attend her championship football match. But another friend just called
to offer you an extra ticket for your favorite musician's
farewell tour. You know this is 
a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and you can’t pass it up. Plus, you figure Marie wouldn’t
mind if you miss the game— she always has plenty of fans
supporting her. But the next day, Marie tells you 
she was really hurt when she didn’t see you in the crowd. You feel terrible for upsetting her 
and genuinely want to apologize. But while you regret hurting Marie, you’re not actually sure 
if you made the wrong choice. So how can you reach beyond
that terrible non-apology, “I’m sorry YOU feel this way”? In situations like this, it can be easy 
to focus on rationalizing your actions when you should be working to understand 
the other person’s perspective. Consider asking Marie 
how you made them feel to better understand your offense. In this case, Marie might explain 
that she was disappointed you broke your promise, and she was really counting 
on your support. This kind of clarity can help 
you recognize your wrongdoing and honestly accept how your actions
caused harm. Then you can frame your apology 
around addressing her concerns, perhaps by admitting that it was wrong
of you to break your promise, and you're sorry you weren't
there for her. Clearly acknowledging wrongdoing
indicates that you know exactly how you messed up, and it can give Marie faith that you’ll

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It’s 5 p.m. and you’ve just realized 
that report you’ve been putting off is due tomorrow. It’s time to buckle down, 
open your computer... and check your phone. Maybe catch up on your favorite
YouTube channel? Actually, you should probably 
make dinner first. You usually like cooking, though it’s hard to enjoy with this work
hanging over your head, and oh— it’s actually pretty late! Maybe you should just try again
in the morning? This is the cycle of procrastination,
and I promise you, we have all been there. But why do we keep procrastinating 
even when we know it’s bad for us? To be clear, putting something off isn’t
always procrastinating. Responsible time management requires
deciding which tasks are important and which ones can wait. Procrastination is when we avoid a task 
we said we would do, for no good reason, despite expecting our behavior 
to bring negative consequences. Obviously, it’s irrational to do something
you expect to harm you. But ironically, procrastination is the 
result of our bodies trying to protect us, specifically by avoiding a task 
we see as threatening. When you realize you need
to write that report, your brain responds like it would
to any incoming threat. Your amygdala, a set of neurons 
involved in emotional processing and threat identification, releases hormones including adrenaline
that kick off a fear response. This stress-induced panic can overpower
the impulses from your prefrontal cortex, which typically help you think 
long term and regulate your emotions. And it’s in the midst
of this fight, flight, or freeze response that you decide to handle the threat by avoiding it in favor
of some less stressful task. This response might seem extreme— after all, it’s just a deadline,
not a bear attack. But we’re most likely to procrastinate
tasks that evoke negative feelings, such as dread, incompetence,
and insecurity. Studies of procrastinating university
students have found participants were more likely to put off tasks they
perceived as stressful or challenging. And the perception of how difficult
the task is increases while you’re putting it off. In one experiment, students were given
reminders to study throughout the day. While they were studying,
most reported that it wasn’t so bad. But when they were procrastinating, they consistently rated the idea
of studying as very stressful, making it difficult to get started. Because procrastination is motivated
by our negative feelings, some individuals are more susceptible
to it than others. People who have difficulty
regulating their emotions and those who struggle 
with low self-esteem are much more likely to procrastinate, regardless of how good
they are at time management. However, it's a common misconception
that all procrastinators are lazy. In the body and brain, laziness is marked
by no energy and general apathy. When you’re feeling lazy, you’re more
likely to sit around doing nothing than distract yourself 
with unimportant tasks. In fact, many people procrastinate
because they care too much. Procrastinators often report
a high fear of failure, putting things off because they’re afraid
their work won’t live up to their high standards. Whatever the reason for procrastination, 
the results are often the same. Frequent procrastinators are likely 
to suffer from anxiety and depression, ongoing feelings of shame, higher stress levels and physical ailments
associated with high stress. Worst of all, while procrastination
hurts us in the long run, it does temporarily reduce
our stress level, reinforcing it as a bodily response
for coping with stressful tasks. So, how can we break the cycle
of procrastination? Traditionally, people thought 
procrastinators needed to cultivate discipline and practice 
strict time management. But today, many researchers
feel the exact opposite. Being too hard on yourself can layer
additional bad emotions onto a task, making the threat even more intense. To short-circuit this stress response, we need to address and reduce
these negative emotions. Some simple strategies include breaking
a task into smaller elements or journaling about why
it's stressing you out and addressing those underlying concerns. Try removing nearby distractions that make
it easy to impulsively procrastinate. And more than anything, it helps to
cultivate an attitude of self-compassion, forgiving yourself,
and making a plan to do better next time. Because a culture that perpetuates
this cycle of stress and procrastination hurts all of us in the long term.

Evaluation Prompt:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It’s 5 p.m. and you’ve just realized 
that report you’ve been putting off is due tomorrow. It’s time to buckle down, 
open your computer... and check your phone. Maybe catch up on your favorite
YouTube channel? Actually, you should probably 
make dinner first. You usually like cooking, though it’s hard to enjoy with this work
hanging over your head, and oh— it’s actually pretty late! Maybe you should just try again
in the morning? This is the cycle of procrastination,
and I promise you, we have all been there. But why do we keep procrastinating 
even when we know it’s bad for us? To be clear, putting something off isn’t
always procrastinating. Responsible time management requires
deciding which tasks are important and which ones can wait. Procrastination is when we avoid a task 
we said we would do, for no good reason, despite expecting our behavior 
to bring negative consequences. Obviously, it’s irrational to do something
you expect to harm you. But ironically, procrastination is the 
result of our bodies trying to protect us, specifically by avoiding a task 
we see as threatening. When you realize you need
to write that report, your brain responds like it would
to any incoming threat. Your amygdala, a set of neurons 
involved in emotional processing and threat identification, releases hormones including adrenaline
that kick off a fear response. This stress-induced panic can overpower
the impulses from your prefrontal cortex, which typically help you think 
long term and regulate your emotions. And it’s in the midst
of this fight, flight, or freeze response that you decide to handle the threat by avoiding it in favor
of some less stressful task. This response might seem extreme— after all, it’s just a deadline,
not a bear attack. But we’re most likely to procrastinate
tasks that evoke negative feelings, such as dread, incompetence,
and insecurity. Studies of procrastinating university
students have found participants were more likely to put off tasks they
perceived as stressful or challenging. And the perception of how difficult
the task is increases while you’re putting it off. In one experiment, students were given
reminders to study throughout the day. While they were studying,
most reported that it wasn’t so bad. But when they were procrastinating, they consistently rated the idea
of studying as very stressful, making it difficult to get started. Because procrastination is motivated
by our negative feelings, some individuals are more susceptible
to it than others. People who have difficulty
regulating their emotions and those who struggle 
with low self-esteem are much more likely to procrastinate, regardless of how good
they are at time management. However, it's a common misconception
that all procrastinators are lazy. In the body and brain, laziness is marked
by no energy and general apathy. When you’re feeling lazy, you’re more
likely to sit around doing nothing than distract yourself 
with unimportant tasks. In fact, many people procrastinate
because they care too much. Procrastinators often report
a high fear of failure, putting things off because they’re afraid
their work won’t live up to their high standards. Whatever the reason for procrastination, 
the results are often the same. Frequent procrastinators are likely 
to suffer from anxiety and depression, ongoing feelings of shame, higher stress levels and physical ailments
associated with high stress. Worst of all, while procrastination
hurts us in the long run, it does temporarily reduce
our stress level, reinforcing it as a bodily response
for coping with stressful tasks. So, how can we break the cycle
of procrastination? Traditionally, people thought 
procrastinators needed to cultivate discipline and practice 
strict time management. But today, many researchers
feel the exact opposite. Being too hard on yourself can layer
additional bad emotions onto a task, making the threat even more intense. To short-circuit this stress response, we need to address and reduce
these negative emotions. Some simple strategies include breaking
a task into smaller elements or journaling about why
it's stressing you out and addressing those underlying concerns. Try removing nearby distractions that make
it easy to impulsively procrastinate. And more than anything, it helps to
cultivate an attitude of self-compassion, forgiving yourself,
and making a plan to do better next time. Because a culture that perpetuates
this cycle of stress and procrastination hurts all of us in the long term.

**Transcript**:
¿Hablas español? Parlez-vous français? 
你会说中文吗？ If you answered, "sí," "oui," or "会"
and you're watching this in English, chances are you belong to the world's
bilingual and multilingual majority. And besides having 
an easier time traveling or watching movies without subtitles, knowing two or more languages
means that your brain may actually look and work differently
than those of your monolingual friends. So what does it really 
mean to know a language? Language ability is typically measured
in two active parts, speaking and writing, and two passive parts, 
listening and reading. While a balanced bilingual has near equal abilities across the board 
in two languages, most bilinguals around the world
know and use their languages in varying proportions. And depending on their situation
and how they acquired each language, they can be classified into
three general types. For example, let's take Gabriella, whose family immigrates to the US 
from Peru when she's two-years old. As a compound bilingual, Gabriella develops two linguistic 
codes simultaneously, with a single set of concepts, learning both English and Spanish as she begins to process 
the world around her. Her teenage brother, on the other hand,
might be a coordinate bilingual, working with two sets of concepts, learning English in school, while continuing to speak Spanish
at home and with friends. Finally, Gabriella's parents are likely
to be subordinate bilinguals who learn a secondary language by filtering it through
their primary language. Because all types of bilingual people
can become fully proficient in a language regardless of accent or pronunciation, the difference may not be apparent
to a casual observer. But recent advances 
in brain imaging technology have given neurolinguists a glimpse into how specific aspects of language
learning affect the bilingual brain. It's well known that the brain's
left hemisphere is more dominant and analytical in logical processes, while the right hemisphere is more active
in emotional and social ones, though this is a matter of degree,
not an absolute split. The fact that language involves
both types of functions while lateralization develops
gradually with age, has lead to the critical 
period hypothesis. According to this theory, children learn languages more easily because the plasticity 
of their developing brains lets them use both hemispheres
in language acquisition, while in most adults, language 
is lateralized to one hemisphere, usually the left. If this is true, learning a language
in childhood may give you a more holistic grasp
of its social and emotional contexts. Conversely, recent research showed that people who learned 
a second language in adulthood exhibit less emotional bias
and a more rational approach when confronting problems
in the second language than in their native one. But regardless of when you acquire
additional languages, being multilingual gives your brain
some remarkable advantages. Some of these are even visible, such as higher density of the grey matter that contains most of your brain's 
neurons and synapses, and more activity in certain regions
when engaging a second language. The heightened workout a bilingual
brain receives throughout its life can also help delay the onset of diseases,
like Alzheimer's and dementia by as much as five years. The idea of major cognitive 
benefits to bilingualism may seem intuitive now, but it would have surprised 
earlier experts. Before the 1960s, bilingualism
was considered a handicap that slowed a child's development by forcing them to spend too much energy
distinguishing between languages, a view based largely on flawed studies. And while a more recent study did show that reaction times and errors increase
for some bilingual students in cross-language tests, it also showed that the effort
and attention needed to switch between languages
triggered more activity in, and potentially strengthened,
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This is the part of the brain
that plays a large role in executive function, problem solving,
switching between tasks, and focusing while filtering out
irrelevant information. So, while bilingualism may not
necessarily make you smarter, it does make your brain more healthy,
complex and actively engaged, and even if you didn't have 
the good fortune of learning a second language as a child, it's never too late to do 
yourself a favor and make the linguistic 
leap from, "Hello," to, "Hola," "Bonjour" or "你好’s" because when it comes to our brains
a little exercise can go a long way.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Hunger claws at your grumbling belly. It tugs at your intestines, 
which begin to writhe, aching to be fed. Being hungry generates a powerful,
often unpleasant physical sensation that's almost impossible to ignore. After you've reacted by gorging
on your morning pancakes, you start to experience 
an opposing force, fullness, but how does your body actually know
when you're full? The sensation of fullness is set in motion
as food moves from your mouth down your esophagus. Once it hits your stomach,
it gradually fills the space. That causes the surrounding
muscular wall to stretch, expanding slowly like a balloon. A multitude of nerves wrapped
intricately around the stomach wall sense the stretching. They communicate with the vagus nerve
up to the brainstem and hypothalamus, the main parts of the brain
that control food intake. But that's just one input your brain uses
to sense fullness. After all, if you fill 
your stomach with water, you won't feel full for long. Your brain also takes into account
chemical messengers in the form of hormones produced
by endocrine cells throughout your digestive system. These respond to the presence of specific
nutrients in your gut and bloodstream, which gradually increase 
as you digest your food. As the hormones seep out, 
they're swept up by the blood and eventually reach the hypothalamus
in the brain. Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones 
are involved in moderating our appetites. One example is cholecystokinin, which is produced in response to food
by cells in the upper small bowel. When it reached the hypothalamus, it causes a reduction in the feeling
of reward you get when you eat food. When that occurs, the sense
of being satiated starts to sink in and you stop eating. Cholecystokinin also slows down
the movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. That makes your stomach stretch
more over a period of time, allowing your body to register
that you're filling up. This seems to be why when you eat slowly,
you actually feel fuller compared to when you consume your food
at lightning speed. When you eat quickly, your body doesn't
have time to recognize the state it's in. Once nutrients and gastrointestinal
hormones are present in the blood, they trigger the pancreas
to release insulin. Insulin stimulates the body's fat cells
to make another hormone called leptin. Leptin reacts with receptors
on neuron populations in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has two sets of neurons
important for our feeling of hunger. One set produces the sensation of hunger
by making and releasing certain proteins. The other set inhibits hunger through
its own set of compounds. Leptin inhibits the hypothalamus neurons
that drive food intake and stimulates the neurons 
that suppress it. By this point, your body has reached
peak fullness. Through the constant exchange 
of information between hormones, the vagus nerve, the brainstem, and the different portions 
of hypothalamus, your brain gets the signal
that you've eaten enough. Researchers have discovered that some foods produce 
more long-lasting fullness than others. For instance, boiled potatoes are ranked as some of the most 
hunger-satisfying foods, while croissants 
are particularly unsatisfying. In general, foods with more protein,
fiber, and water tend to keep hunger at bay for longer. But feeling full won't last forever. After a few hours, your gut and brain
begin their conversation again. Your empty stomach produces
other hormones, such as ghrelin, that increase the activity of 
the hunger-causing nerve cells in the hypothalamus. Eventually, the growling beast of hunger
is reawakened. Luckily, there's a dependable 
antidote for that.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Right now, you're probably sitting down
to watch this video and staying seated for a few minutes
to view it is probably okay. But the longer you stay put,
the more agitated your body becomes. It sits there counting down the moments
until you stand up again and take it for a walk. That may sound ridiculous. Our bodies love to sit, right? Not really. Sure, sitting for brief periods 
can help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise. But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit
much more than we move around, and our bodies simply aren't built
for such a sedentary existence. In fact, just the opposite is true. The human body is built to move, and you can see evidence of that
in the way it's structured. Inside us are over 360 joints,
and about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy, fluid motion. The body's unique physical structure
gives us the ability to stand up straight against the pull of gravity. Our blood depends on us moving around
to be able to circulate properly. Our nerve cells benefit from movement, and our skin is elastic, 
meaning it molds to our motions. So if every inch of the body
is ready and waiting for you to move, what happens when you just don't? Let's start with the backbone
of the problem, literally. Your spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs
that sit between them. Joints, muscles and ligaments
that are attached to the bones hold it all together. A common way of sitting is with a
curved back and slumped shoulders, a position that puts uneven
pressure on your spine. Over time, this causes wear and tear
in your spinal discs, overworks certain ligaments and joints, and puts strain on muscles that stretch to accommodate 
your back's curved position. This hunched shape also shrinks
your chest cavity while you sit, meaning your lungs have less space
to expand into when you breath. That's a problem because it temporarily
limits the amount of oxygen that fills your lungs
and filters into your blood. Around the skeleton are the muscles,
nerves, arteries and veins that form the body's soft tissue layers. The very act of sitting squashes,
pressurizes and compresses, and these more delicate tissues
really feel the brunt. Have you ever experienced numbness
and swelling in your limbs when you sit? In areas that are the most compressed, your nerves, arteries and veins
can become blocked, which limits nerve signaling,
causing the numbness, and reduces blood flow in your limbs,
causing them to swell. Sitting for long periods also temporarily
deactivates lipoprotein lipase, a special enzyme in the walls
of blood capillaries that breaks down fats in the blood, so when you sit, you're not burning fat
nearly as well as when you move around. What effect does all of this stasis
have on the brain? Most of the time, 
you probably sit down to use your brain, but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting
actually run counter to this goal. Being stationary reduces blood flow and the amount of oxygen entering
your blood stream through your lungs. Your brain requires both 
of those things to remain alert, so your concentration levels
will most likely dip as your brain activity slows. Unfortunately, the ill effects of being
seated don't only exist in the short term. Recent studies have found 
that sitting for long periods is linked with some types of cancers
and heart disease and can contribute to diabetes,
kidney and liver problems. In fact, researchers 
have worked out that, worldwide, inactivity causes about 
9% of premature deaths a year. That's over 5 million people. So what seems like such a harmless habit actually has the power 
to change our health. But luckily, the solutions to this
mounting threat are simple and intuitive. When you have no choice but to sit, try switching the slouch 
for a straighter spine, and when you don't have 
to be bound to your seat, aim to move around much more, perhaps by setting a reminder
to yourself to get up every half hour. But mostly, just appreciate that bodies
are built for motion, not for stillness. In fact, since the video's almost over,
why not stand up and stretch right now? Treat your body to a walk. It'll thank you later.

**Transcript**:
(intro song) From colorful pills to chewy gummies in the shape of your favorite cartoon character There are tons of multivitamin supplements to choose from and people spend billions of dollars every year trying to boost their health with them. But if you look on the back of the bottle lots of these supplements have more than 100%. Sometimes up to 500% or 2000% of the recommended daily value for different vitamins inside. So, why are they so jam-packed with vitamins? And is taking all these supplements actually good for you? Well, if you are healthy and eating a balanced diet, you should be getting all the vitamins you need. So at best, they probably aren't doing very much. At worst, they could be doing you harm. Vitamins are important compounds that our bodies need to grow and function. But we need to get them from food because we can't make them, or enough of them, ourselves. There are fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K which means they dissolve in lipids and B vitamins and Vitamin C are water-soluble which means they dissolve in water. And different vitamins come from different foods. Vitamin K, for example, can come from dark green vegetables, while Vitamin C is in all kinds of citrus fruits, and your body can vitamin D after spending some time in the sun. If you're deficient in any of them, your cells and enzymes won't be able to work properly, and you could be prone to diseases. So the reason to taking multi-vitamin supplements is usually to prevent any vitamin deficiencies. Sounds reasonable. But taking supplements when you don't actually need them can cause problems. Multi-vitamins generally have more than 100% of your Recommended Dietary Allowance, or RDA. RDA values are set by national organizations that study food and nutrition. They're basically the estimated nutrient requirements for healthy people. The same scientific committees also estimate a tolerable Upper intake Level, or UL which is the max amount of these nutrients you can take, without risking some negative health effects. Generally, the levels for water-soluble vitamins are a lot higher than for fat-soluable vitamins. Either way, when you take a multivitamin that has more than 100% of the RDA for different vitamins, your body might not be digesting and absorbing it all. Your body tends to get rid of any excess water-soluble vitamins by peeing them out. But it stores the extra fat-soluble vitamins in your fatty tissues. The problem is megadoses of vitamins. If you consistently take the UL dose over weeks or months, especially with fat-soluble vitamins, these vitamins will keep building up in your body, and eventually cause toxicity or other health problems. For example, Vitamin D normally helps your body absorb calcium but a lot Vitamin D could cause a buildup of calcium in your blood called Hypercalcemia or even damage your heart. So even though your body needs vitamins to survive, taking multivitamins doesn't replace the nutrients you get from a balanced diet, and can even be harmful if you overdo it. If you have some sort of health condition, or pregnant, definitely listen to your doctor and the supplements they recommend. But, usually just taking a bunch of extra multivitamins won't do much for your health. Thanks to Patreon patreon Richard Willis for asking this question.

**Transcript**:
It's easy to tell when someone's
not paying attention, but it can be surprisingly tricky to know
what truly excellent listening looks like. Behavioral scientists have found
that good listening is one of the most important things 
we can do to improve our relationships, develop our worldview, and potentially
even change people's minds. So, what can we do to become
better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one
conversation is about taking an interest in another person 
and making them feel understood. There’s no universally agreed 
upon definition of high-quality listening, but some recurring features include
attentiveness, conveying understanding, and showing a positive intention
towards the speaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply
go through the motions— researchers have found
that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals doesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly
performative about listening in that it’s important to show 
you’re doing it. So, in addition to actively attending
to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions
and body language that indicate their understanding
and their desire to understand. This might feel awkward at first, and what’s most effective might depend
on your relationship with the speaker. But with time and practice you can
internalize these basic behaviors. So let’s say a good friend wants
to tell you about an issue they’re having with their partner. Before even starting your conversation, remove any distractions 
in the environment. Turn off the TV, take off your headphones 
and put your phone away— far away. One study showed that even
the visible presence of a phone made conversations feel less
intimate and fulfilling to those involved. Once the conversation begins, one of the most important things 
you can do is also the most obvious— try not to interrupt. This doesn’t mean
you need to stay completely silent. But if you do interject, 
look for natural pauses to ask open-ended questions
that benefit the speaker, not just your curiosity. Questions like “What happened next?”
or “How did that make you feel?” confirm that you’re following
the story while also helping the speaker dive deeper into their own thoughts. Another great way to show your
understanding is by summarizing what you just heard 
and asking if you’ve missed anything. Summaries like this show the speaker that
you're truly trying to understand them rather than just waiting
for your turn to talk. Speaking of which, while a good
conversation requires back and forth, planning out your response 
while the speaker is talking is a common way to miss what’s being said. So try to stay present 
and if you lose focus, don't be shy about asking the speaker
to repeat what you missed. This might feel embarrassing, but asking for clarification actually
shows that you’re committed to understanding. Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to ask for a moment to formulate
your response and taking a beat to think can help 
speakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small changes, 
but together they make a big difference. And when people feel heard, 
they report more satisfaction, trust, and connection 
in their relationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard
generally experience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened
to them more favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be
easy to listen to some people, it can be hard to muster all
this focus and attention if you disagree with 
or dislike the speaker. But these situations might actually
benefit most from your efforts to listen openly. The theory of psychological reactance
suggests that trying to force someone to change their mind makes them
more likely to defend their point of view. However, recent studies suggest 
that high-quality listening fosters open-mindedness by creating 
a non-judgmental and psychologically safe environment. Of course, truly open-minded listening
isn’t about changing people’s minds. Good listening is not 
the same as agreeing, and conversations don’t have 
to end with a happy resolution. But even during a disagreement, sometimes being heard is enough 
to start a deeper conversation.

**Transcript**:
It's easy to tell when someone's
not paying attention, but it can be surprisingly tricky to know
what truly excellent listening looks like. Behavioral scientists have found
that good listening is one of the most important things 
we can do to improve our relationships, develop our worldview, and potentially
even change people's minds. So, what can we do to become
better listeners? At its core, listening in a one-on-one
conversation is about taking an interest in another person 
and making them feel understood. There’s no universally agreed 
upon definition of high-quality listening, but some recurring features include
attentiveness, conveying understanding, and showing a positive intention
towards the speaker. This doesn’t mean you can simply
go through the motions— researchers have found
that merely smiling and nodding at set intervals doesn’t quite work. However, there is something slightly
performative about listening in that it’s important to show 
you’re doing it. So, in addition to actively attending
to a speaker’s words, good listeners also use questions
and body language that indicate their understanding
and their desire to understand. This might feel awkward at first, and what’s most effective might depend
on your relationship with the speaker. But with time and practice you can
internalize these basic behaviors. So let’s say a good friend wants
to tell you about an issue they’re having with their partner. Before even starting your conversation, remove any distractions 
in the environment. Turn off the TV, take off your headphones 
and put your phone away— far away. One study showed that even
the visible presence of a phone made conversations feel less
intimate and fulfilling to those involved. Once the conversation begins, one of the most important things 
you can do is also the most obvious— try not to interrupt. This doesn’t mean
you need to stay completely silent. But if you do interject, 
look for natural pauses to ask open-ended questions
that benefit the speaker, not just your curiosity. Questions like “What happened next?”
or “How did that make you feel?” confirm that you’re following
the story while also helping the speaker dive deeper into their own thoughts. Another great way to show your
understanding is by summarizing what you just heard 
and asking if you’ve missed anything. Summaries like this show the speaker that
you're truly trying to understand them rather than just waiting
for your turn to talk. Speaking of which, while a good
conversation requires back and forth, planning out your response 
while the speaker is talking is a common way to miss what’s being said. So try to stay present 
and if you lose focus, don't be shy about asking the speaker
to repeat what you missed. This might feel embarrassing, but asking for clarification actually
shows that you’re committed to understanding. Finally, don’t be afraid of silence. It’s okay to ask for a moment to formulate
your response and taking a beat to think can help 
speakers reflect on their speech as well. These might seem like small changes, 
but together they make a big difference. And when people feel heard, 
they report more satisfaction, trust, and connection 
in their relationships. In the workplace, employees who feel heard
generally experience less burnout, and perceive the managers who listened
to them more favorably. Unfortunately, while it might be
easy to listen to some people, it can be hard to muster all
this focus and attention if you disagree with 
or dislike the speaker. But these situations might actually
benefit most from your efforts to listen openly. The theory of psychological reactance
suggests that trying to force someone to change their mind makes them
more likely to defend their point of view. However, recent studies suggest 
that high-quality listening fosters open-mindedness by creating 
a non-judgmental and psychologically safe environment. Of course, truly open-minded listening
isn’t about changing people’s minds. Good listening is not 
the same as agreeing, and conversations don’t have 
to end with a happy resolution. But even during a disagreement, sometimes being heard is enough 
to start a deeper conversation.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 2
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice. Practice is the repetition of an action
with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease,
speed, and confidence. So what does practice do in our brains
to make us better at things? Our brains have two kinds 
of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter. The grey matter processes information
in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli
to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up
of fatty tissue and nerve fibers. In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from
the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers
called axons to our muscles. So how does practice or repetition
affect the inner workings of our brains? The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance
called myelin. And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,
that seems to change with practice. Myelin is similar to insulation
on electrical cables. It prevents energy loss from electrical
signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently
along neural pathways. Some recent studies in mice suggest
that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath
that insulates the axons. And the more layers, the greater
the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway
for information connecting your brain to your muscles. So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes 
to muscle memory, muscles themselves 
don't really have memory. Rather, it may be the myelination
of neural pathways that gives these athletes 
and performers their edge with faster and more efficient 
neural pathways. There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours,
days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill. While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about
the amount of hours of practice. It's also the quality and effectiveness
of that practice. Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge 
of one's current abilities. So if effective practice is the key, how can we get the most 
out of our practice time? Try these tips. Focus on the task at hand. Minimize potential distractions by turning
off the computer or TV and putting your cell phone 
on airplane mode. In one study, researchers observed 260
students studying. On average, those students were able to stay 
on task for only six minutes at a time. Laptops, smartphones, 
and particularly Facebook were the root of most distractions. Start out slowly or in slow-motion. Coordination is built with repetitions,
whether correct or incorrect. If you gradually increase the speed
of the quality repetitons, you have a better chance 
of doing them correctly. Next, frequent repetitions with allotted
breaks are common practice habits of elite performers. Studies have shown that many top athletes,
musicians, and dancers spend 50-60 hours per week on activities
related to their craft. Many divide their time 
used for effective practice into multiple daily practice sessions
of limited duration. And finally, practice in your brain
in vivid detail. It's a bit surprising, but a number
of studies suggest that once a physical motion 
has been established, it can be reinforced 
just by imagining it. In one study, 144 basketball players
were divided into two groups. Group A physically practiced 
one-handed free throws while Group B only 
mentally practiced them. When they were tested at the end
of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced
players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount. As scientists get closer to unraveling
the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice
will only improve. In the meantime, effective practice
is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Mastering any physical skill, be it performing a pirouette, playing an instrument, or throwing a baseball, takes practice. Practice is the repetition of an action
with the goal of improvement, and it helps us perform with more ease,
speed, and confidence. So what does practice do in our brains
to make us better at things? Our brains have two kinds 
of neural tissue: grey matter and white matter. The grey matter processes information
in the brain, directing signals and sensory stimuli
to nerve cells, while white matter is mostly made up
of fatty tissue and nerve fibers. In order for our bodies to move, information needs to travel from
the brain's grey matter, down the spinal cord, through a chain of nerve fibers
called axons to our muscles. So how does practice or repetition
affect the inner workings of our brains? The axons that exist in the white matter are wrapped with a fatty substance
called myelin. And it's this myelin covering, or sheath,
that seems to change with practice. Myelin is similar to insulation
on electrical cables. It prevents energy loss from electrical
signals that the brain uses, moving them more efficiently
along neural pathways. Some recent studies in mice suggest
that the repetition of a physical motion increases the layers of myelin sheath
that insulates the axons. And the more layers, the greater
the insulation around the axon chains, forming a sort of superhighway
for information connecting your brain to your muscles. So while many athletes and performers attribute their successes 
to muscle memory, muscles themselves 
don't really have memory. Rather, it may be the myelination
of neural pathways that gives these athletes 
and performers their edge with faster and more efficient 
neural pathways. There are many theories that attempt to quantify the number of hours,
days, and even years of practice that it takes to master a skill. While we don't yet have a magic number, we do know that mastery isn't simply about
the amount of hours of practice. It's also the quality and effectiveness
of that practice. Effective practice is consistent, intensely focused, and targets content or weaknesses that lie at the edge

has been established, it can be reinforced 
just by imagining it. In one study, 144 basketball players
were divided into two groups. Group A physically practiced 
one-handed free throws while Group B only 
mentally practiced them. When they were tested at the end
of the two week experiment, the intermediate and experienced
players in both groups had improved by nearly the same amount. As scientists get closer to unraveling
the secrets of our brains, our understanding of effective practice
will only improve. In the meantime, effective practice
is the best way we have of pushing our individual limits, achieving new heights, and maximizing our potential.

Evaluation Prompt:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, 
they are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65%
by their first birthday. So what role does water 
play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink
to stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion
and lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost
three quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount
of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones
are 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters
through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing. While these functions 
are essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level
is essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating
effects on overall health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors 
in the brain's hypothalamus signal the release 
of antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys, 
it creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood
to absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause
notable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder 
to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks
because of its lack of water. Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption
of water in a short amount of time. Athletes are often the victims 
of over-hydration because of complications 
in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain amps
up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows,
or even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body
become diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with 
the resulting volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures
or death. But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system
is easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough 
to have access to clean drinking water. For a long time, conventional wisdom said
that we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned. Now, the consensus is that the amount
of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight
and environment. The recommended daily intake varies from
between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up 
or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine 
like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And water within food makes up 
about a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while
providing valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have various
long-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration
can lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk
of certain types of cancer. No matter what, getting the right amount
of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Each year in the United States, players of sports 
and recreational activities receive between 2.5 
and 4 million concussions. How dangerous are all those concussions? The answer is complicated, and lies in how the brain responds
when something strikes it. The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,
with a consistency something like jello. Inside its protective membranes
and the skull's hard casing, this delicate organ 
is usually well-shielded. But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against 
the skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue
isn't uniform. It's made of a vast network
of 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long
axons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. This spindly structure makes 
them very fragile so that when impacted, neurons
will stretch and even tear. That not only disrupts their ability
to communicate but as destroyed axons begin
to degenerate, they also release toxins
causing the death of other neurons, too. This combination of events causes
a concussion. The damage can manifest 
in many different ways including blackout, headache, blurry vision, balance problems, altered mood and behavior, problems with memory, 
thinking, and sleeping, and the onset of anxiety and depression. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences
of concussions vary so widely. Luckily, the majority of concussions
fully heal and symptoms disappear
within a matter of days or weeks. Lots of rest and a gradual return
to activity allows the brain to heal itself. On the subject of rest, many people have heard that
you're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concussion
because you might slip into a coma. That's a myth. So long as doctors aren't concerned there
may also be a more severe brain injury, like a brain bleed, there's no documented problem with
going to sleep after a concussion. Sometimes, victims of concussion can
experience something called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS. People with PCS may experience
constant headaches, learning difficulties, and behavioral symptoms that even
affect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury. Trying to play through a concussion,
even for only a few minutes, or returning to sports too soon
after a concussion, makes it more likely to develop PCS. In some cases, a concussion 
can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly
over time. That's often true of 
subconcussive impacts which result from lower impact jolts
to the head than those that cause concussions. This category of injury doesn't cause
noticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative
brain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Take soccer players, who are known
for repeatedly heading soccer balls. Using a technique called
Diffusion Tensor Imaging, we're beginning to find out what effect
that has on the brain. This method allows scientists to find
large axon bundles and see how milder blows
might alter them structurally. In 2013, researchers using 
this technique discovered that athletes who had 
headed the ball most, about 1,800 times a year, had damaged the structural integrity
of their axon bundles. The damage was similar to how
a rope will fail when the individual fibers start to fray. Those players also performed worse
on short-term memory tests, so even though no one suffered
full-blown concussions, these subconcussive hits added up
to measurable damage over time. In fact, researchers know that an
overload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease
known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. People with CTE suffer from changes
in their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s followed by problems with thinking
and memory that can, in some cases, even result
in dementia. The culprit is a protein called tau. Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes
inside our axons called microtubules. It's thought that repeated subconcussive
hits damage the microtubules, causing the tau proteins to dislodge
and clump together. The clumps disrupt transport
and communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connections
within the brain. Once the tau proteins 
start clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread 
throughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. The data show that at least
among football players, between 50 and 80% of concussions
go unreported and untreated. Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell a concussion has occurred 
in the first place. But it's also often due to pressure
or a desire to keep going despite the fact that something's wrong. This doesn't just undermine recovery. It's also dangerous. Our brains aren't invincible. They still need us to shield 
them from harm and help them undo damage
once it's been done.

**Transcript**:
Each year in the United States, players of sports 
and recreational activities receive between 2.5 
and 4 million concussions. How dangerous are all those concussions? The answer is complicated, and lies in how the brain responds
when something strikes it. The brain is made of soft fatty tissue,
with a consistency something like jello. Inside its protective membranes
and the skull's hard casing, this delicate organ 
is usually well-shielded. But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against 
the skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue
isn't uniform. It's made of a vast network
of 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long
axons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. This spindly structure makes 
them very fragile so that when impacted, neurons
will stretch and even tear. That not only disrupts their ability
to communicate but as destroyed axons begin
to degenerate, they also release toxins
causing the death of other neurons, too. This combination of events causes
a concussion. The damage can manifest 
in many different ways including blackout, headache, blurry vision, balance problems, altered mood and behavior, problems with memory, 
thinking, and sleeping, and the onset of anxiety and depression. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences
of concussions vary so widely. Luckily, the majority of concussions
fully heal and symptoms disappear
within a matter of days or weeks. Lots of rest and a gradual return
to activity allows the brain to heal itself. On the subject of rest, many people have heard that
you're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concussion
because you might slip into a coma. That's a myth. So long as doctors aren't concerned there
may also be a more severe brain injury, like a brain bleed, there's no documented problem with
going to sleep after a concussion. Sometimes, victims of concussion can
experience something called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS. People with PCS may experience
constant headaches, learning difficulties, and behavioral symptoms that even
affect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury. Trying to play through a concussion,
even for only a few minutes, or returning to sports too soon
after a concussion, makes it more likely to develop PCS. In some cases, a concussion 
can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly
over time. That's often true of 
subconcussive impacts which result from lower impact jolts
to the head than those that cause concussions. This category of injury doesn't cause
noticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative
brain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Take soccer players, who are known
for repeatedly heading soccer balls. Using a technique called
Diffusion Tensor Imaging, we're beginning to find out what effect
that has on the brain. This method allows scientists to find
large axon bundles and see how milder blows
might alter them structurally. In 2013, researchers using 
this technique discovered that athletes who had 
headed the ball most, about 1,800 times a year, had damaged the structural integrity
of their axon bundles. The damage was similar to how
a rope will fail when the individual fibers start to fray. Those players also performed worse
on short-term memory tests, so even though no one suffered
full-blown concussions, these subconcussive hits added up
to measurable damage over time. In fact, researchers know that an
overload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease
known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. People with CTE suffer from changes
in their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s followed by problems with thinking
and memory that can, in some cases, even result
in dementia. The culprit is a protein called tau. Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes
inside our axons called microtubules. It's thought that repeated subconcussive
hits damage the microtubules, causing the tau proteins to dislodge
and clump together. The clumps disrupt transport
and communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connections
within the brain. Once the tau proteins 
start clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread 
throughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. The data show that at least
among football players, between 50 and 80% of concussions
go unreported and untreated. Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell a concussion has occurred 
in the first place. But it's also often due to pressure

**Transcript**:
Across the whole planet, humans eat on average between
one and 2.7 kilograms of food a day. That's over 365 kilograms 
a year per person, and more than 28,800 kilograms
over the course of a lifetime. And every last scrap makes its way
through the digestive system. Comprised of ten organs 
covering nine meters, and containing 
over 20 specialized cell types, this is one of the most diverse
and complicated systems in the human body. Its parts continuously work in unison
to fulfill a singular task: transforming the raw materials
of your food into the nutrients and energy
that keep you alive. Spanning the entire length of your torso, the digestive system 
has four main components. First, there's the gastrointestinal tract, a twisting channel 
that transports your food and has an internal surface area
of between 30 and 40 square meters, enough to cover half a badminton court. Second, there's the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver, a trio of organs that break down food
using an array of special juices. Third, the body's enzymes, hormones, nerves, and blood all work together to break down food, modulate the digestive process, and deliver its final products. Finally, there's the mesentery, a large stretch of tissue that supports and positions all your digestive organs 
in the abdomen, enabling them to do their jobs. The digestive process begins
before food even hits your tongue. Anticipating a tasty morsel, glands in your mouth start 
to pump out saliva. We produce about 1.5 liters
of this liquid each day. Once inside your mouth, chewing combines with the sloshing saliva to turn food into a moist lump 
called the bolus. Enzymes present in the saliva
break down any starch. Then, your food finds itself at the rim of a 25-centimeter-long tube 
called the esophagus, down which it must plunge 
to reach the stomach. Nerves in the surrounding 
esophageal tissue sense the bolus's presence 
and trigger peristalsis, a series of defined muscular contractions. That propels the food into the stomach, where it's left at the mercy
of the muscular stomach walls, which bound the bolus, 
breaking it into chunks. Hormones, secreted by cells in the lining,
trigger the release of acids and enzyme-rich juices 
from the stomach wall that start to dissolve the food
and break down its proteins. These hormones also alert the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder to produce digestive juices and transfer bile, a yellowish-green 
liquid that digests fat, in preparation for the next stage. After three hours inside the stomach, the once shapely bolus is now
a frothy liquid called chyme, and it's ready to move into
the small intestine. The liver sends bile 
to the gallbladder, which secretes it into the first portion of
the small intestine called the duodenum. Here, it dissolves the fats
floating in the slurry of chyme so they can be easily digested
by the pancreatic and intestinal juices that have leached onto the scene. These enzyme-rich juices break the fat
molecules down into fatty acids and glycerol for easier 
absorption into the body. The enzymes also carry out 
the final deconstruction of proteins into amino acids and carbohydrates into glucose. This happens in the 
small intestine's lower regions, the jejunum and ileum, which are coated in millions 
of tiny projections called villi. These create a huge surface area
to maximize molecule absorption and transference into the blood stream. The blood takes them on the final
leg of their journey to feed the body's organs and tissues. But it's not over quite yet. Leftover fiber, water, and dead cells 
sloughed off during digestion make it into the large intestine,
also known as the colon. The body drains out most of the remaining
fluid through the intestinal wall. What's left is a soft mass called stool. The colon squeezes this byproduct
into a pouch called the rectum, where nerves sense it expanding and tell the body when 
it's time to expel the waste. The byproducts of digestion
exit through the anus and the food's long journey, typically lasting between 30 and 40 hours, is finally complete.

**Transcript**:
Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers 
living in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this 
strange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became 
the building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, 
ripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia 
of dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic
people an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, 
fats, and minerals. But it also contained high 
quantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for 
many ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese, however, could provide all of 
milk’s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved 
and stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines 
and long winters. Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments 
found in Turkey still contain telltale residues of 
the cheese and butter they held. By the end of the Bronze Age, cheese was a standard commodity 
in maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean. In the densely populated city-states of 
Mesopotamia, cheese became a staple 
of culinary and religious life. Some of the earliest known writing includes administrative records 
of cheese quotas, listing a variety of cheeses for different
rituals and populations across Mesopotamia. Records from nearby civilizations 
in Turkey also reference rennet. This animal byproduct, produced in the
stomachs of certain mammals, can accelerate and control coagulation. Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking
tool spread around the globe, giving way to a wide variety of new, 
harder cheeses. And though some conservative food 
cultures rejected the dairy delicacy, many more embraced cheese, and quickly
added their own local flavors. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to
create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage 
cheese, straining the whey with reed mats. In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a
variety of food acids, such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer. This soft mild cheese could be added to 
curries and sauces, or simply fried as a 
quick vegetarian dish. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined
feta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano. This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean. Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,” became an essential ration for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire. And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed, cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside. In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries
scattered across Europe, medieval monks experimented endlessly 
with different types of milk, cheesemaking practices, and aging processes that led to many 
of today’s popular cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster 
and several Swiss types were all refined and perfected 
by these cheesemaking clergymen. In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was
particularly successful – producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses. By the end of the 14th century, Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands to take control of the growing 
cheese trade. Cheese remained popular through

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Before empires and royalty, before pottery and writing, before metal tools and weapons – there was cheese. As early as 8000 BCE, the earliest Neolithic farmers 
living in the Fertile Crescent began a legacy of cheesemaking almost as old as civilization itself. The rise of agriculture led to 
domesticated sheep and goats, which ancient farmers harvested for milk. But when left in warm conditions 
for several hours, that fresh milk began to sour. Its lactic acids caused proteins to 
coagulate, binding into soft clumps. Upon discovering this 
strange transformation, the farmers drained the remaining liquid – later named whey – and found the yellowish globs could be 
eaten fresh as a soft, spreadable meal. These clumps, or curds, became 
the building blocks of cheese, which would eventually be aged, pressed, 
ripened, and whizzed into a diverse cornucopia 
of dairy delights. The discovery of cheese gave Neolithic
people an enormous survival advantage. Milk was rich with essential proteins, 
fats, and minerals. But it also contained high 
quantities of lactose – a sugar which is difficult to process for 
many ancient and modern stomachs. Cheese, however, could provide all of 
milk’s advantages with much less lactose. And since it could be preserved 
and stockpiled, these essential nutrients could be eaten throughout scarce famines 
and long winters. Some 7th millennium BCE pottery fragments 
found in Turkey still contain telltale residues of 
the cheese and butter they held. By the end of the Bronze Age, cheese was a standard commodity 
in maritime trade throughout the eastern Mediterranean. In the densely populated city-states of 
Mesopotamia, cheese became a staple 
of culinary and religious life. Some of the earliest known writing includes administrative records 
of cheese quotas, listing a variety of cheeses for different
rituals and populations across Mesopotamia. Records from nearby civilizations 
in Turkey also reference rennet. This animal byproduct, produced in the
stomachs of certain mammals, can accelerate and control coagulation. Eventually this sophisticated cheesemaking
tool spread around the globe, giving way to a wide variety of new, 
harder cheeses. And though some conservative food 
cultures rejected the dairy delicacy, many more embraced cheese, and quickly
added their own local flavors. Nomadic Mongolians used yaks’ milk to
create hard, sundried wedges of Byaslag. Egyptians enjoyed goats’ milk cottage 
cheese, straining the whey with reed mats. In South Asia, milk was coagulated with a
variety of food acids, such as lemon juice, vinegar, or yogurt and then hung to dry into loafs of paneer. This soft mild cheese could be added to 
curries and sauces, or simply fried as a 
quick vegetarian dish. The Greeks produced bricks of salty brined
feta cheese, alongside a harder variety similar to 
today’s pecorino romano. This grating cheese was produced in Sicily and used in dishes all across the 
Mediterranean. Under Roman rule, “dry cheese” 
or “caseus aridus,” became an essential ration for the nearly 500,000 soldiers guarding
the vast borders of the Roman Empire. And when the Western Roman 
Empire collapsed, cheesemaking continued to evolve in the manors that dotted the medieval
European countryside. In the hundreds of Benedictine monasteries
scattered across Europe, medieval monks experimented endlessly 
with different types of milk, cheesemaking practices, and aging processes that led to many 
of today’s popular cheeses. Parmesan, Roquefort, Munster 
and several Swiss types were all refined and perfected 
by these cheesemaking clergymen. In the Alps, Swiss cheesemaking was
particularly successful – producing a myriad of cow’s milk cheeses. By the end of the 14th century, Alpine cheese from the Gruyere region of
Switzerland had become so profitable that a neighboring state invaded the 
Gruyere highlands to take control of the growing 
cheese trade. Cheese remained popular through 
the Renaissance, and the Industrial Revolution took 
production out of the monastery and into machinery. Today, the world produces roughly 
22 billion kilograms of cheese a year, shipped and consumed around the globe. But 10,000 years after its invention, local farms are still following in the

**Transcript**:
Late one night in 1871, a group of riders 
descended on a sleeping army camp. In minutes they stirred the camp 
into a panic, stole about 70 horses,
and disappeared. Led by a young chief 
named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest 
in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier 
between the indigenous people known as the Numunu, 
or Comanches, and the United States forces sent 
to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie 
led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel 
drew near his targets, they disappeared without 
a trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled 
this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages
around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican 
attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land 
by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ 
bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not 
one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, 
each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common 
was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child 
was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both 
other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area
with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie 
faced off. Born around 1848, Quanah 
was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, 
and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated
with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, 
capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought 
refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah 
proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young 
woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father 
and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing 
Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band 
was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast 
market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions 
of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led 
a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s 
1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, 
Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced 
certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah 
and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation 
in Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers,
they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life 
on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised
rations and supplies, but what they provided 
was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly 
in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power 
compared to others who had been 
on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect 
for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement 
leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights
with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income
for the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials
grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction 
of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges 
on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint 
one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed 
outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported 
Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders 
had supported him to lead them against 
the U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, 
Ranald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment. Quanah acted in Hollywood movies 
and befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s
inauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American 
Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, 
adopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down 
his mother and sister, eventually learning they had both 
died shortly after their capture. Quanah adapted again and again—
to different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem 
insurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, 
after Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official 
in the tribe, recognizing him 
as the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural 
survival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation
looks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens 
and countless descendants.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Late one night in 1871, a group of riders 
descended on a sleeping army camp. In minutes they stirred the camp 
into a panic, stole about 70 horses,
and disappeared. Led by a young chief 
named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest 
in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier 
between the indigenous people known as the Numunu, 
or Comanches, and the United States forces sent 
to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie 
led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel 
drew near his targets, they disappeared without 
a trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled 
this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages
around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican 
attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land 
by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ 
bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not 
one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, 
each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common 
was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child 
was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both 
other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area
with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie 
faced off. Born around 1848, Quanah 
was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, 
and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated
with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, 
capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought 
refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah 
proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young 
woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father 
and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing 
Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band 
was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast 
market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions 
of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led 
a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s 
1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, 
Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced 
certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah 
and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation 
in Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers,
they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life 
on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised
rations and supplies, but what they provided 
was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly 
in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power 
compared to others who had been 
on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect 
for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement 
leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights
with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income
for the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials
grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction 
of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges 
on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint 
one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed

Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker,

**Transcript**:
Late one night in 1871, a group of riders 
descended on a sleeping army camp. In minutes they stirred the camp 
into a panic, stole about 70 horses,
and disappeared. Led by a young chief 
named Quanah Parker, the raid was the latest 
in a long series of altercations along the Texas frontier 
between the indigenous people known as the Numunu, 
or Comanches, and the United States forces sent 
to steal Comanche lands for white settlers. Though the conflict was decades old, U.S. Colonel Ranald MacKenzie 
led the latest iteration. From summer to winter, he tracked Quanah. But Quanah was also tracking him, and each time the colonel 
drew near his targets, they disappeared without 
a trace into the vast plains. The Comanches had controlled 
this territory for nearly 200 years, hunting buffalo and moving whole villages
around the plains. They suppressed Spanish and Mexican 
attacks from the south, attempts to settle the land 
by the United States from the east, and numerous other indigenous peoples’ 
bids for power. The Comanche Empire was not 
one unified group under central control, but rather a number of bands, 
each with its own leaders. What all of these bands had in common 
was their prowess as riders— every man, woman, and child 
was adept on horseback. Their combat skills on horseback far surpassed those of both 
other indigenous peoples and colonists, allowing them to control an enormous area
with relatively few people— probably about 40,000 at their peak and only about 4-5,000 by the time Quanah Parker and Ranald Mackenzie 
faced off. Born around 1848, Quanah 
was the eldest child of Peta Nocona, a leader of the Nokoni band, 
and Cynthia Ann Parker, a kidnapped white settler who assimilated
with the Comanches and took the name Naduah. When Quanah was a preteen, U.S. forces ambushed his village, 
capturing his mother and sister. Quanah and his younger brother sought 
refuge with a different Comanche band, the Quahada. In the years that followed, Quanah 
proved himself as a warrior and leader. In his early twenties, he and a young 
woman named Weakeah eloped, enraging her powerful father 
and several other leaders. They stayed on the run for a year, attracting followers and establishing 
Quanah as a paraibo, or chief, at an exceptionally young age. Under his leadership the Quahada band 
was able to elude the U.S. military and continue their way of life. But in the early 1870s, the East Coast 
market for buffalo hides became lucrative, and hunters slaughtered millions 
of buffalo in just a few years. Meanwhile, U.S. forces led 
a surprise attack, killing nearly all the Quahada band’s 
1,400 horses and stealing the rest. Though he had vowed to never surrender, 
Quanah knew that without bison or horses, the Comanches faced 
certain starvation in winter. So in 1875 Quanah 
and the Quahada band moved to the Fort Sill reservation 
in Oklahoma. As hunter-gatherers,
they could not transition easily to an agricultural way of life 
on the reservation. The U.S. government had promised
rations and supplies, but what they provided 
was wildly insufficient. Quanah, meanwhile, was suddenly 
in a weak political position: he had no wealth or power 
compared to others who had been 
on the reservation longer. Still, he saw an opportunity. The reservation included ample grasslands— useless to the Comanches but perfect 
for cattle ranchers to graze their herds. He began a profitable arrangement 
leasing the land to cattle ranchers, quietly at first. Eventually, he negotiated leasing rights
with the U.S. government, which ensured a steady source of income
for the Comanches on the reservation. As Quanah’s status on the reservation and recognition from government officials
grew, he secured better rations, advocated for the construction 
of schools and houses, and became one of three tribal judges 
on the reservation court. Tired of speaking with multiple leaders, the U.S. government wanted to appoint 
one chief of all Comanches— a role that hadn’t existed 
outside the reservation. Still, many Comanches supported 
Quanah for this role, just as several older leaders 
had supported him to lead them against 
the U.S. armed forces. Even Quanah’s former adversary, 
Ranald MacKenzie, advocated for his appointment. Quanah acted in Hollywood movies 
and befriended American politicians, riding in Theodore Roosevelt’s
inauguration parade. Still, he never cut his long braids and advocated for the Native American 
Church and the use of peyote. He began to go by Quanah Parker, 
adopting his mother’s surname, and tried to track down 
his mother and sister, eventually learning they had both 
died shortly after their capture. Quanah adapted again and again—
to different worlds, different roles, and circumstances that would seem 
insurmountable to most. Though he wasn’t without critics, 
after Quanah’s passing, Comanches began using the term “chairman” to designate the top elected official 
in the tribe, recognizing him 
as the last chief of the Comanches and a model of cultural 
survival and adaptation. In that spirit, today’s Comanche Nation
looks towards the future, with over 16,000 enrolled citizens 
and countless descendants.

**Transcript**:
Baked or fried, boiled or roasted, as chips or fries. At some point in your life,
you've probably eaten a potato. Delicious, for sure, but the fact is potatoes have played a
much more significant role in our history than just that of the dietary staple
we have come to know and love today. Without the potato, our modern civilization 
might not exist at all. 8,000 years ago in South America,
high atop the Andes, ancient Peruvians were the first
to cultivate the potato. Containing high levels of proteins
and carbohydrates, as well as essential fats, vitamins
and minerals, potatoes were the perfect food source
to fuel a large Incan working class as they built and farmed 
their terraced fields, mined the Rocky Mountains, and created the sophisticated civilization
of the great Incan Empire. But considering how vital they were
to the Incan people, when Spanish sailors 
returning from the Andes first brought potatoes to Europe, the spuds were duds. Europeans simply didn't want to eat what they considered dull and tasteless
oddities from a strange new land, too closely related to the deadly
nightshade plant belladonna for comfort. So instead of consuming them, they used potatoes 
as decorative garden plants. More than 200 years would pass
before the potato caught on as a major food source throughout Europe, though even then, it was predominantly eaten 
by the lower classes. However, beginning around 1750, and thanks at least in part to the wide availability
of inexpensive and nutritious potatoes, European peasants 
with greater food security no longer found themselves at the mercy of the regularly 
occurring grain famines of the time, and so their populations steadily grew. As a result, the British, Dutch
and German Empires rose on the backs of the growing groups
of farmers, laborers, and soldiers, thus lifting the West to its place
of world dominion. However, not all European countries
sprouted empires. After the Irish adopted the potato, their population dramatically increased, as did their dependence on the tuber
as a major food staple. But then disaster struck. From 1845 to 1852, potato blight disease ravaged 
the majority of Ireland's potato crop, leading to the Irish Potato Famine, one of the deadliest famines
in world history. Over a million Irish citizens 
starved to death, and 2 million more 
left their homes behind. But of course, this wasn't the end
for the potato. The crop eventually recovered, and Europe's population,
especially the working classes, continued to increase. Aided by the influx of Irish migrants, Europe now had a large, sustainable,
and well-fed population who were capable of manning
the emerging factories that would bring about our modern world
via the Industrial Revolution. So it's almost impossible to imagine
a world without the potato. Would the Industrial Revolution 
ever have happened? Would World War II have been lost
by the Allies without this easy-to-grow crop
that fed the Allied troops? Would it even have started? When you think about it like this, many major milestones in world history
can all be at least partially attributed to the simple spud 
from the Peruvian hilltops.

**Transcript**:
Baked or fried, boiled or roasted, as chips or fries. At some point in your life,
you've probably eaten a potato. Delicious, for sure, but the fact is potatoes have played a
much more significant role in our history than just that of the dietary staple
we have come to know and love today. Without the potato, our modern civilization 
might not exist at all. 8,000 years ago in South America,
high atop the Andes, ancient Peruvians were the first
to cultivate the potato. Containing high levels of proteins
and carbohydrates, as well as essential fats, vitamins
and minerals, potatoes were the perfect food source
to fuel a large Incan working class as they built and farmed 
their terraced fields, mined the Rocky Mountains, and created the sophisticated civilization
of the great Incan Empire. But considering how vital they were
to the Incan people, when Spanish sailors 
returning from the Andes first brought potatoes to Europe, the spuds were duds. Europeans simply didn't want to eat what they considered dull and tasteless
oddities from a strange new land, too closely related to the deadly
nightshade plant belladonna for comfort. So instead of consuming them, they used potatoes 
as decorative garden plants. More than 200 years would pass
before the potato caught on as a major food source throughout Europe, though even then, it was predominantly eaten 
by the lower classes. However, beginning around 1750, and thanks at least in part to the wide availability
of inexpensive and nutritious potatoes, European peasants 
with greater food security no longer found themselves at the mercy of the regularly 
occurring grain famines of the time, and so their populations steadily grew. As a result, the British, Dutch
and German Empires rose on the backs of the growing groups
of farmers, laborers, and soldiers, thus lifting the West to its place
of world dominion. However, not all European countries
sprouted empires. After the Irish adopted the potato, their population dramatically increased, as did their dependence on the tuber
as a major food staple. But then disaster struck. From 1845 to 1852, potato blight disease ravaged 
the majority of Ireland's potato crop, leading to the Irish Potato Famine, one of the deadliest famines
in world history. Over a million Irish citizens 
starved to death, and 2 million more 
left their homes behind. But of course, this wasn't the end
for the potato. The crop eventually recovered, and Europe's population,
especially the working classes, continued to increase. Aided by the influx of Irish migrants, Europe now had a large, sustainable,
and well-fed population who were capable of manning
the emerging factories that would bring about our modern world
via the Industrial Revolution. So it's almost impossible to imagine
a world without the potato. Would the Industrial Revolution 
ever have happened? Would World War II have been lost
by the Allies without this easy-to-grow crop
that fed the Allied troops? Would it even have started? When you think about it like this, many major milestones in world history
can all be at least partially attributed to the simple spud 
from the Peruvian hilltops.

**Transcript**:
Over the years, people have come 
up with some truly awful apologies. From classic non-apologies 
to evasive excuses, and flimsy corporate promises, it’s all too easy to give a bad apology. But researchers have found that good
apologies generally share certain elements and thoughtfully considering
these factors can help you make amends in a wide variety of situations. Since public apologies have their
own unique complications, we’re going to focus on some
person-to-person examples. So, picture this: your new office has
free ice cream sandwiches in the communal fridge— or at least that’s what you thought. But on Friday, when you’re helping
your co-worker Terence set up another colleague's birthday party, he finds that half the ice cream he bought
for the celebration is gone. While this is obviously 
an embarrassing accident, coming forward and apologizing 
is still the right thing to do. Understanding and accepting
responsibility for your actions is what some researchers call
the “centerpiece of an apology.” But it’s okay if this feels difficult
and vulnerable— it’s supposed to be! The costly nature of apologies is part
of what makes them meaningful. So while you might be tempted to defend
your actions as accidental, it’s important to remember 
that a good apology isn’t about making you feel better. It’s about seeking to understand 
the perspective of the wronged party and repair the damage 
to your relationship. This means that while clarifying your 
intentions non-defensively can be helpful, your mistake being an accident shouldn’t
absolve you from offering a sincere apology. But what if your mistake 
wasn’t an accident? Consider this: you promised your friend Marie that you’ll
attend her championship football match. But another friend just called
to offer you an extra ticket for your favorite musician's
farewell tour. You know this is 
a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and you can’t pass it up. Plus, you figure Marie wouldn’t
mind if you miss the game— she always has plenty of fans
supporting her. But the next day, Marie tells you 
she was really hurt when she didn’t see you in the crowd. You feel terrible for upsetting her 
and genuinely want to apologize. But while you regret hurting Marie, you’re not actually sure 
if you made the wrong choice. So how can you reach beyond
that terrible non-apology, “I’m sorry YOU feel this way”? In situations like this, it can be easy 
to focus on rationalizing your actions when you should be working to understand 
the other person’s perspective. Consider asking Marie 
how you made them feel to better understand your offense. In this case, Marie might explain 
that she was disappointed you broke your promise, and she was really counting 
on your support. This kind of clarity can help 
you recognize your wrongdoing and honestly accept how your actions
caused harm. Then you can frame your apology 
around addressing her concerns, perhaps by admitting that it was wrong
of you to break your promise, and you're sorry you weren't
there for her. Clearly acknowledging wrongdoing
indicates that you know exactly how you messed up, and it can give Marie faith that you’ll 
behave differently moving forward. But it’s always helpful to indicate 
exactly how you’ll change and what you’ll do to repair 
the damage caused by your offense. Researchers call this 
the “offer of repair,” and it's often rated as one of the most
critical parts of an apology. In some cases, these gestures
are straightforward, like offering to replace
the ice cream you eat. However, with less 
tangible transgressions, this might need to be more symbolic, like expressing your love and respect
for someone you wronged. One common offer of repair 
is a verbal commitment not to make the same mistake again, but promising to do better only works
if you actually do better. Taking the victim’s perspective, 
accepting responsibility, and making concrete offers of repair are just a few of the elements
of a good apology. But remember, apologies aren’t about
getting forgiveness and moving on; they’re about expressing remorse
and accepting accountability. And the best apologies are
just the first step on the road to reconciliation.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What do some researchers consider the "centerpiece of an apology"?
Options: A. Acknowledging the other person's feelings, B. Finding mutual blame, C. Accepting responsibility for your actions, D. Reminding the wronged party that your actions were out of character
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the primary difference between defiant and independent reactance?
Options: A. Defiant reactance is a desire for independence, while independent reactance is a desire for defiant behavior., B. Defiant reactance is impulsively doing the opposite of what we're told, while independent reactance reflects our deeper desire to make our own choices., C. Defiant reactance is a reaction to external threats, while independent reactance is a reaction to internal threats., D. Defiant reactance is a short-term response, while independent reactance is a long-term response.

the “offer of repair,” and it's often rated as one of the most
critical parts of an apology. In some cases, these gestures
are straightforward, like offering to replace
the ice cream you eat. However, with less 
tangible transgressions, this might need to be more symbolic, like expressing your love and respect
for someone you wronged. One common offer of repair 
is a verbal commitment not to make the same mistake again, but promising to do better only works
if you actually do better. Taking the victim’s perspective, 
accepting responsibility, and making concrete offers of repair are just a few of the elements
of a good apology. But remember, apologies aren’t about
getting forgiveness and moving on; they’re about expressing remorse
and accepting accountability. And the best apologies are
just the first step on the road to reconciliation.
