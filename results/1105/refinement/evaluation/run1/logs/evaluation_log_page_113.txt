**Transcript**:
On March 14th, 1970, Robert White
and his team carted two small monkeys into an operating room. The neurosurgeon lay on the verge
of an ambitious experiment, decades in the making,
which was bizarre, if not pulled straight
from his own fever dream. White’s objective? Connect the head of Monkey A
to the body of Monkey B, in what he considered
a whole-body transplant. White’s ultimate goal was to one day
perform this surgery on humans. While disturbing,
the idea of a body transplant raises ethical, biological,
and philosophical questions— on the nature of life
and the limits of science— that are still discussed today. But first, is it even medically possible? White's surgery faced several
technical hurdles. For one thing, it guaranteed paralysis as no doctor then— or now—
could reconnect a severed spinal cord. But White,
a practicing neurosurgeon, thought the surgery could be life-saving for his patients with spinal cord injuries
or progressive mobility diseases like ALS. These patients often face
multi-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing
all of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply
of oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely
interrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down
and it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was
selectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood
remained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled
the brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor
into “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team
would have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour
without causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized
the field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer
to his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught
with serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify
such an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain
and neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die
to prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics
was still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including
many in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research
and strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval
from agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt
a monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed
with temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered
the head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,
the team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject
to awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,
and extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey
could see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off
one of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation
could work. The brain appeared to survive
a head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,
could live without immune rejection. But had White performed
a body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions
about the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports
the central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons
and the microbiome suggest that the answer
may be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside
outside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected
by circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed
more than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant
he dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have
expressed interest in picking up where White left off,
reviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully
connect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge? And is extending a life
always worth the cost?

multi-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing
all of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply
of oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely
interrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down
and it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was
selectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood
remained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled
the brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor
into “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team
would have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour
without causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized
the field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer
to his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught
with serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify
such an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain
and neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die
to prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics
was still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including
many in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research
and strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval
from agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt
a monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed
with temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered
the head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,
the team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject
to awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,
and extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey
could see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off
one of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation
could work. The brain appeared to survive
a head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,
could live without immune rejection. But had White performed
a body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions
about the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports
the central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons
and the microbiome suggest that the answer
may be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside
outside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected
by circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed
more than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant
he dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have
expressed interest in picking up where White left off,
reviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully
connect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge? And is extending a life
always worth the cost?

**Transcript**:
On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men, sent by the American CIA, snuck into the cafeteria
of the Havana Libre Hotel. Their directive was to retrieve
a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake
of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour
up to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are
contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our
world’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts
and iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,
Mughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed
by the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze
these delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent
laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was
on every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil
brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors
selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered
the appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic
properties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:
the soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol
was banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented
themselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch
and Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology
was improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer
that could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped
with freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues
to take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries
may never be solved, one thing is certain:
our love for ice cream will never thaw.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the origin of the word "sherbet," while the generated MCQs are all related to heat pumps, refrigeration, and thermodynamics.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic of the transcript, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 4 is the most similar, as it is the only question that mentions a concept (thermodynamics) that is tangentially related to the topic of ice cream and refrigeration discussed in the transcript. However, the question intent and content are still not similar.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" or "No match found," as the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men, sent by the American CIA, snuck into the cafeteria
of the Havana Libre Hotel. Their directive was to retrieve
a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake
of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour
up to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are
contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our
world’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts
and iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,
Mughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed
by the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze
these delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent
laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was

**Transcript**:
Typically, with any piece of technology,
you get out what you put in. Pump one unit of energy
into an electric toaster and you get about one
out in the form of heat. That’s just the first law
of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology
called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using
their electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor
and spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—
from heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit
of energy, you get 3 to 5 units of heat out. Seems like magic, but it's just physics.

**Transcript**:
Typically, with any piece of technology,
you get out what you put in. Pump one unit of energy
into an electric toaster and you get about one
out in the form of heat. That’s just the first law
of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology
called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks

**Transcript**:
It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes
for sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066
when French speakers conquered England. French became the language
of authority and high society. But English remained the dominant
spoken language. Over time, those descended from French
speakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck
into the language. Some English speakers were also familiar
with Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing
in English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine
word choice and spelling, including the French they knew,
the Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press
arrived in England. Some of the people working the presses
may have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts
that varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers
went with various spellings based in part on what they happened
to encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways
and was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with
was one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be
represented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped
the guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing
it as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized
the spelling even though the pronunciation
eventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words
also fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges
of past pronunciations. But while the printing press
was solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing
what scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced
many vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then
been pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel
position it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”
often became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,
there's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word
depended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”
among other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”
and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough.

to encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways
and was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with
was one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be
represented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped
the guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing
it as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized
the spelling even though the pronunciation
eventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words
also fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges
of past pronunciations. But while the printing press
was solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing
what scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced
many vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then
been pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel
position it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”
often became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,
there's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word
depended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”
among other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”
and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough.

**Transcript**:
It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes
for sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066
when French speakers conquered England. French became the language
of authority and high society. But English remained the dominant
spoken language. Over time, those descended from French
speakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck
into the language. Some English speakers were also familiar
with Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing
in English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine
word choice and spelling, including the French they knew,
the Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press
arrived in England. Some of the people working the presses
may have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts
that varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the Great Vowel Shift in the English language, while the generated MCQs are about unrelated topics such as dictators, democracies, and ancient Rome.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 6 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (although it's not a good match)

To find a good match, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is the English language and its history.

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the characterization of the ancient Roman statesman Cincinnatus, while the generated MCQs are about unrelated topics and do not mention Cincinnatus.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it is the least unrelated to the topic of the transcript, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 7 is the most similar, only because it is the only question that mentions a person (although it is not Cincinnatus) and has a somewhat similar format to the ground truth MCQ. However, please note that this is a very weak match and not a good match at all.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 7 (with a big caveat that it's not a good match)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the closest match would be a question that discusses the features of a democracy and how they relate to the appeal of a dictatorship.

If I had to choose from the provided generated MCQs, I would say that none of them are a good match. However, I can try to find a question that somehow relates to the topic of democracy and dictatorship.

Question 5 mentions the transfer of wealth from young to old and how it is related to the fact that old people vote and have more power in politics. While this question is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ, it does touch on the topic of how certain aspects of a democracy (in this case, voting power) can lead to undesirable outcomes.

However, I must emphasize that this is a very weak match, and I would not recommend using Question 5 as a substitute for the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the closest match is Question 5, but I want to stress that this is not a good match.

Index: 5 (with the caveat that this is not a good match)

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the political climate in which authoritarian dictators often rise to power. While none of the generated MCQs directly address this question, Question 8 mentions "financial insecurity" as a factor contributing to stress and anxiety among younger generations. This is somewhat related to the concept of economic hardship, which is mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

However, I must emphasize that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Therefore, I will not provide an index of a matching generated MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 8, but with a strong caveat that it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated
anaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world
before the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii
form their blanket, they increase the density
of that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms
are forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water
called bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon
might be a clue to how early life evolved
the ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights
that await researchers studying Cadagno’s mysterious depths.

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated
anaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world
before the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii
form their blanket, they increase the density
of that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms
are forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water
called bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon
might be a clue to how early life evolved
the ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights
that await researchers studying Cadagno’s mysterious depths.

**Transcript**:
In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to air pollution, filtration, and masks, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about Hannah Arendt's philosophy and the modern age.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs have any resemblance to the ground truth MCQ. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 5, only because it has a faint connection to "modernity" in the sense that it talks about a limitation of a modern technology (size-based filters), but this connection is extremely weak and not relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" or "No match found".

**Transcript**:
In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection.

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
What would make you happy? Can you imagine a milestone, a win,
or even a material possession that would unlock this feeling? In this animated version of
David Steindl-Rast’s popular TED Talk, Brother David explains how a simple
adjustment in how you move through the world might just change
what you see, how you feel, and how you act. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well,
that’s very easy. When you are happy, you’re grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people
that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people
who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy,
because they want something else, or they want more of the same. And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. Now, we can ask, what really do we mean 
by gratefulness? And how does it work? Something’s given to us
that’s valuable to us. And it’s really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift. And when these two things come together, then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That’s how gratefulness happens. Now, the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this
once in a while. We can be people who live gratefully. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment
is a given moment, as we say. It’s a gift. You have no way of assuring that there
will be another moment given to you, and yet, that’s the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us, this moment,
with all the opportunity that it contains. Does that mean that we can be grateful
for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence,
for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss
of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn’t say we can be grateful
for everything. I said we can be grateful in every
given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us. So how can each one of us find
a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful,
but moment by moment to be grateful? How can we do it? It’s a very simple method:
Stop. Look. Go. That’s all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life; we don’t stop. We miss the opportunity
because we don’t stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs
into our lives. And when you stop, then the next thing
is to look. You look. You open your eyes.
You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this
wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,
our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,
to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts
to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us
to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers
to you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware
how important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,
you’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act
out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,
and you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying
the differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid
under which we live. What we need is a networking
of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups
who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to mathematics, specifically axioms and the Banach-Tarski paradox, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to gratefulness and living gratefully.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one that is vaguely similar in structure, I would say Question 3, but this is a huge stretch and not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are related to the topic of gratefulness and living gratefully, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
What would make you happy? Can you imagine a milestone, a win,
or even a material possession that would unlock this feeling? In this animated version of
David Steindl-Rast’s popular TED Talk, Brother David explains how a simple
adjustment in how you move through the world might just change
what you see, how you feel, and how you act. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well,
that’s very easy. When you are happy, you’re grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people
that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people
who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy,
because they want something else, or they want more of the same. And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. Now, we can ask, what really do we mean 
by gratefulness? And how does it work? Something’s given to us
that’s valuable to us. And it’s really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift. And when these two things come together, then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That’s how gratefulness happens. Now, the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this
once in a while. We can be people who live gratefully. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment
is a given moment, as we say. It’s a gift. You have no way of assuring that there
will be another moment given to you, and yet, that’s the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us, this moment,
with all the opportunity that it contains. Does that mean that we can be grateful
for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence,
for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss
of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn’t say we can be grateful
for everything. I said we can be grateful in every
given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us. So how can each one of us find
a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful,
but moment by moment to be grateful? How can we do it? It’s a very simple method:
Stop. Look. Go. That’s all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life; we don’t stop. We miss the opportunity
because we don’t stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs
into our lives. And when you stop, then the next thing
is to look. You look. You open your eyes.
You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this
wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,
our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,
to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts
to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us
to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers
to you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware
how important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,
you’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act
out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,
and you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying
the differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid
under which we live. What we need is a networking
of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups
who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

You might think of gas masks as
clunky, spooky, military-looking devices only found in spy movies
or World War I museums. But you probably already own a mask
that uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may
need to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled
from 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,
their smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing
more hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production
of toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new
and old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is
making sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask
in the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants
in one of two ways: filtering them out by size or
attracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,
let’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate
a wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many
different pollutants at such high concentrations
that no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel
with their own air supply. But further away,
the situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid
or liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what
you're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous
for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory
or cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these
particulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene 
or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,
they look like a thick forest, and at this scale, these branches
have a special property. Typically, when you use a sieve, you’re filtering out objects
larger than the sieve’s holes. But these polypropylene branches
can catch particles much smaller than the gaps between them. That’s because, when a particle
collides with a thread, van der Waals forces cause it to stick
as if it were made of Velcro. Plus, size-based filters can use
electrically charged fibers that attract particles not already
on a collision course. This is how even a simple N95 mask can
catch at least 95% of particulate matter. And why an N100 mask or an air purifier with a high efficiency
particulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will
filter out most airborne pollution. Unfortunately, some pollutants are still
too small for this approach, including ozone molecules. These are barely bigger than the oxygen
that we need to breathe and exposure is associated with asthma,
respiratory conditions, and even premature death. Our best chance to filter them
are activated carbon masks. At the microscopic level, activated carbon
looks like a vast black honeycomb, and it's highly microporous structure
can trap tiny ozone molecules. But this material still needs help
to capture other pollutants like hydrogen sulfide, chlorine,
and ammonia. For these threats, we need to combine
the activated carbon with some simple chemistry. If the pollutant is acidic, we can infuse
the filter with a basic chemical. Then when the two meet, they react,
and the gas is trapped. Similarly, we can use acids
to trap basic pollutants. Even with the right mask, it's still smart
to check air quality indicators and to stay indoors
when the threat level is high. And just like a mask, you'll want to make
sure your house is well sealed. You can do this by closing windows,
turning off fans that vent outside, and using HEPA filter equipped
air purifiers or their cheaper, DIY cousin,
the Corsi-Rosenthal box. Following these guidelines can help
us breathe easy as we work on preventing these pollutants
in the first place.

particulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will
filter out most airborne pollution. Unfortunately, some pollutants are still
too small for this approach, including ozone molecules. These are barely bigger than the oxygen
that we need to breathe and exposure is associated with asthma,
respiratory conditions, and even premature death. Our best chance to filter them
are activated carbon masks. At the microscopic level, activated carbon
looks like a vast black honeycomb, and it's highly microporous structure
can trap tiny ozone molecules. But this material still needs help
to capture other pollutants like hydrogen sulfide, chlorine,
and ammonia. For these threats, we need to combine
the activated carbon with some simple chemistry. If the pollutant is acidic, we can infuse
the filter with a basic chemical. Then when the two meet, they react,
and the gas is trapped. Similarly, we can use acids
to trap basic pollutants. Even with the right mask, it's still smart
to check air quality indicators and to stay indoors
when the threat level is high. And just like a mask, you'll want to make
sure your house is well sealed. You can do this by closing windows,
turning off fans that vent outside, and using HEPA filter equipped
air purifiers or their cheaper, DIY cousin,
the Corsi-Rosenthal box. Following these guidelines can help
us breathe easy as we work on preventing these pollutants
in the first place.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as ocean health and conservation, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the functioning of an N95 mask.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But, I can suggest a way to create a similar MCQ. A generated MCQ that asks about the mechanism of an N95 mask or a similar type of mask would be a good match. For example:

Question: How do N95 masks capture particulate matter?
Options: A. By using a magnetic field to capture particles, B. By electrically charged fibers attracting particles, C. By using water to trap particles, D. By heating the air to remove particles

This type of question would be a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

Since there is no similar generated MCQ, I will not provide an index.

**Transcript**:
You might think of gas masks as
clunky, spooky, military-looking devices only found in spy movies
or World War I museums. But you probably already own a mask
that uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may
need to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled
from 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,
their smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing
more hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production
of toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new
and old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is
making sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask
in the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants
in one of two ways: filtering them out by size or
attracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,
let’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate
a wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many
different pollutants at such high concentrations
that no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel
with their own air supply. But further away,
the situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid
or liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what
you're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous
for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory
or cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these
particulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene 
or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,
they look like a thick forest, and at this scale, these branches
have a special property. Typically, when you use a sieve, you’re filtering out objects
larger than the sieve’s holes. But these polypropylene branches
can catch particles much smaller than the gaps between them. That’s because, when a particle
collides with a thread, van der Waals forces cause it to stick
as if it were made of Velcro. Plus, size-based filters can use
electrically charged fibers that attract particles not already
on a collision course. This is how even a simple N95 mask can
catch at least 95% of particulate matter. And why an N100 mask or an air purifier with a high efficiency
particulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.

of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city

and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically Operation Paperclip and the recruitment of German scientists in the US after World War II.

The ground truth MCQ is about the Maya of Chichen Itza and their water sources, metal usage, and coping mechanisms with climate change. Since none of the generated MCQs relate to this topic, it is not possible to identify a matching MCQ.

If you could provide a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of the Maya of Chichen Itza, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On March 14th, 1970, Robert White
and his team carted two small monkeys into an operating room. The neurosurgeon lay on the verge
of an ambitious experiment, decades in the making,
which was bizarre, if not pulled straight
from his own fever dream. White’s objective? Connect the head of Monkey A
to the body of Monkey B, in what he considered
a whole-body transplant. White’s ultimate goal was to one day
perform this surgery on humans. While disturbing,
the idea of a body transplant raises ethical, biological,
and philosophical questions— on the nature of life
and the limits of science— that are still discussed today. But first, is it even medically possible? White's surgery faced several
technical hurdles. For one thing, it guaranteed paralysis as no doctor then— or now—
could reconnect a severed spinal cord. But White,
a practicing neurosurgeon, thought the surgery could be life-saving for his patients with spinal cord injuries
or progressive mobility diseases like ALS. These patients often face
multi-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing
all of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply
of oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely
interrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down
and it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was
selectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood
remained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled
the brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor
into “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team
would have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour
without causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized
the field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer
to his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught
with serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify
such an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain
and neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die
to prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics
was still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including
many in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research
and strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval
from agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt
a monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed
with temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered
the head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,
the team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject
to awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,
and extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey
could see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off
one of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation
could work. The brain appeared to survive
a head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,
could live without immune rejection. But had White performed
a body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions
about the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports
the central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons
and the microbiome suggest that the answer
may be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside
outside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected
by circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed
more than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant
he dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have
expressed interest in picking up where White left off,
reviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully
connect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge? And is extending a life
always worth the cost?

**Transcript**:
On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men, sent by the American CIA, snuck into the cafeteria
of the Havana Libre Hotel. Their directive was to retrieve
a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake
of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour
up to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are
contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our
world’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts
and iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,
Mughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed
by the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze
these delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent
laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was
on every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil
brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors
selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered
the appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic
properties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:
the soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol
was banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented
themselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch
and Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology
was improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer
that could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped
with freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues
to take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries
may never be solved, one thing is certain:
our love for ice cream will never thaw.

laborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built
shallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique
known as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would
naturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the
ambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today
made a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,
or sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have
originated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity
in the Middle Ages. European travelers brought
sharbat recipes home, and began creating their own
chocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored
takes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,
a Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a
unique milk-based version, which some historians dub
the first ice cream. In the 18th century,
ice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside
European settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed
by the upper classes as the process to make it
was quite laborious, and its main ingredients—
sugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent
the equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream
in one summer alone. It was on American soil that the
frozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to
engineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,
Nancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine
featuring a crank and beater, which made the process easier
for any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer
an obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”
Frederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice
to households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was
on every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil
brought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors
selling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered
the appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic
properties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:
the soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol
was banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented
themselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch
and Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology
was improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer
that could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped
with freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues
to take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries
may never be solved, one thing is certain:
our love for ice cream will never thaw.

On a hot spring afternoon in 1963, two men, sent by the American CIA, snuck into the cafeteria
of the Havana Libre Hotel. Their directive was to retrieve
a poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake
of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour
up to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are
contested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils
and broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro
many more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our

**Transcript**:
Typically, with any piece of technology,
you get out what you put in. Pump one unit of energy
into an electric toaster and you get about one
out in the form of heat. That’s just the first law
of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology
called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Typically, with any piece of technology,
you get out what you put in. Pump one unit of energy
into an electric toaster and you get about one
out in the form of heat. That’s just the first law
of thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology
called a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,
you get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed
as a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate
by burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible
for about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids
make the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient
than their counterparts, using less energy to produce
the same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,
at best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve
500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology
as air conditioners. And in fact, they often double
as air conditioners, heating your home in the winter
and cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat
from your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law
of thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will
always move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home
over coils containing a substance
called a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas
at relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy
from the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules
closer together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—
way hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the
comparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,
it starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,
which decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat
from your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work
exactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat
from outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside
when you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the
refrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there
are some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be
potent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some
of the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule
can have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays
contained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and
refrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,
the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using
their electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor
and spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—
from heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit

the refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create
new refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air
heat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings
in icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps
that draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,
rather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump
usually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need
more powerful systems, depending on the size of their home
or the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive
than installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money
on utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires
an upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks
of climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies
to help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing
seas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,
using heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps
for entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking
the first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using
their electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor
and spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—
from heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit
of energy, you get 3 to 5 units of heat out. Seems like magic, but it's just physics.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It was June 2010. Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old
wrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity
of English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have
been around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make
English spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full
of irregularities. One commonly used example of this:
take the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”
and the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that
“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic
tribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved
into Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived
around 600 CE, they devised ways to write it
down using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes
for sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066
when French speakers conquered England. French became the language
of authority and high society. But English remained the dominant
spoken language. Over time, those descended from French
speakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck
into the language. Some English speakers were also familiar
with Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing
in English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine
word choice and spelling, including the French they knew,
the Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press
arrived in England. Some of the people working the presses
may have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts
that varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers
went with various spellings based in part on what they happened
to encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways
and was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with
was one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be
represented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped
the guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing
it as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized
the spelling even though the pronunciation
eventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words
also fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges
of past pronunciations. But while the printing press
was solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing
what scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced
many vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then
been pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel
position it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”
often became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,
there's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word
depended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”
among other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”
and “dough” “dah.” These words all started
with different vowel sounds that were then affected differently
by the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was
a haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with
still distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings
that don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be
a difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,
in all its messiness, acted upon English,
making it especially tough.

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You and your partner Alex have been in a
strong, loving relationship for years, and lately you're considering
getting engaged. Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,
but you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end
in divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples
in their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t
even last five years, you feel like tying the knot
would be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just
released an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood
of divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’
social media activity, online search histories, spending habits,
and history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple
will divorce within the first five years of marriage
with 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer
any reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t
divorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not
to get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years
of getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway
and hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending
your currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting
the prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together
and remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself
would be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons
for your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues
would still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining
all these options stems from a well known issue with AI
around explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially
useful predictive models, such as those that could be used
to predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely
to reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems
reach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically
about how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem
doesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction
led you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you
reasonably offer them? That you want to end
your happy relationship because some mysterious machine
predicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people
an explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create
ethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one
of the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring
your agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused
on the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter
why you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity
over accuracy, then you'll need to understand
and appreciate the reasons for your future divorce
before ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is
essential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance
to prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,
it’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts
to defy it, and you’re just setting yourself
up for failure. 95% accuracy is high, 
but it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples
will receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone
who was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI
predicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could
be artificially maintained or even increased by these
self-fulfilling predictions. Of course, no matter what
the AI might tell you, whether you even ask for its prediction
is still up to you.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
According to legend, the ancient Roman
statesman Cincinnatus was plowing his fields
when news arrived that the Aequi, Rome’s powerful enemy to the east,
had invaded. Rome was in need of swift,
decisive action, and the senate had chosen him
to serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military
and government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,
took control and, in a matter of weeks,
saved Rome. This story reinforces the myth
of the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who
holds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, 
to address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator
exist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies
to safeguard against the potentially destructive whims
of a single individual. When functioning properly,
democracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting
against corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,
free, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative
branches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep
politicians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage
in their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,
absolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision
on society. Under certain conditions, the idea
of a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning
as it should due to corruption, economic instability,
or extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some
democratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders
present themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems
into simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian
leaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized
control through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,
and Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted
himself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative
foreign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,
the more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his
position to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence
against everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially
elected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by
embracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and
Germany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves
of mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes
into racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts
the importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually
dismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule
against them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge
unfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded
with yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty
over expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,
social, and environmental costs. But these costs can also
be hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality
by minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda
that presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible
to accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make
the trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have
punished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have
brought modest growth to their nation’s economies
and industries, most have enriched the few and left
widespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,
whose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights
and freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary 
benevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,
he stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control
to the senate was as important to the common good
as his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator
has lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away
from power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide
checks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,
authoritarian regimes.

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated
anaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world
before the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii
form their blanket, they increase the density
of that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms
are forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water
called bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon
might be a clue to how early life evolved
the ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights
that await researchers studying Cadagno’s mysterious depths.

**Transcript**:
Roughly 3 billion years ago, a single-celled photosynthetic bacterium
began burping a new chemical that was poisonous
to nearly every species on Earth. Over the following hundreds
of millions of years, more microorganisms began producing
this toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans
and eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed
the composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused
a global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,
world-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since
the Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all
multicellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places
where oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,
have re-emerged. Many of these places are
in the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water
completely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface
to explore. And one such lake is hidden high
in the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200
known meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies
of water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like
a standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly
for a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject
of local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty
is a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,
fish included. In a typical lake, the entire
body of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen
from the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,
as is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique
chemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater
flowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic
mountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the
Piora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts
such as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite
will slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen
and picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade
from sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,
salt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,
meaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any
oxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind
of anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs
creates microenvironments which feed large aggregates
of microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed
in strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms
take in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed
of pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium
that relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms
move between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t
completely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live
at the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close
to the sun as possible. But while they never cross
into the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms
like zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms
the bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s
legendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than
just a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated
anaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world
before the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii
form their blanket, they increase the density
of that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms
are forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water
called bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon
might be a clue to how early life evolved
the ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights
that await researchers studying Cadagno’s mysterious depths.

**Transcript**:
In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection.

**Transcript**:
In Jerusalem, on April 11th, 1961, Adolf Eichmann stood trial
for crimes against humanity. Eichmann had been a Nazi official
tasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews
to ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described
as an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities
from a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called
“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand
seemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature
and his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired
a disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled
her homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned
by the German secret police. As a refugee in France
and then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding
how the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,
how it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that
the Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens
looking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions
behind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism
weren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed
a theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy
our material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s
physical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly
articulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,
the life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other
industrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age
ruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear
in the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas
and shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered
societies and ideologies where individuals were seen only
for their economic value, rather than their moral
and political capacities. She believed this isolated people from
their neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,
“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided
fertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence
to increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage
as freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,
participating in the regime becomes the only way to recover
a sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this
kind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected
the Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned
his monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann
himself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man
who considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this
ordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone
could do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested
ordinary people could willingly accept
their societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon
“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever
society inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,
to question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is
the only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility
to self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking
in oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires
personal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held
Eichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted
that thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic
and technological development which would increase social alienation
and inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create
formal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations
about shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,
self-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt
is that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection.

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their
stunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected
that mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught
up to their fishing friends with a published account
of the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,
these eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months
after the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left
the mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds
its way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend
the majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,
ponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this
nymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs
for up to two years before they metamorphose
into their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such
a small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species
have a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick
to surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat
with suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,
crawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups
are the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use
their legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads
to dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,
the nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,
filtering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,
adult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays
an essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple
of freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest
particulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive
to water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot
about a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication
that something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm
of mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists
below the surface.

**Transcript**:
Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species
take to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind
of freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica
and a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies
are large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,
or the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,
adulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,
it’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all
eaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food
of many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is
a natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals
they've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,
mayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing
up to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential
to mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies
are likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully
reproduce themselves. In most of these flights,
male mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move
through until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can
reproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis
to produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly
populations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs
are made ready, the female will deposit them
on or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically
brief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their

**Transcript**:
What would make you happy? Can you imagine a milestone, a win,
or even a material possession that would unlock this feeling? In this animated version of
David Steindl-Rast’s popular TED Talk, Brother David explains how a simple
adjustment in how you move through the world might just change
what you see, how you feel, and how you act. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection
between happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well,
that’s very easy. When you are happy, you’re grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people
that are grateful? We all know quite a number of people
who have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy,
because they want something else, or they want more of the same. And we all know people
who have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves
would not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. Now, we can ask, what really do we mean 
by gratefulness? And how does it work? Something’s given to us
that’s valuable to us. And it’s really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,
and it's a real gift. And when these two things come together, then gratefulness spontaneously
rises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That’s how gratefulness happens. Now, the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this
once in a while. We can be people who live gratefully. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment
is a given moment, as we say. It’s a gift. You have no way of assuring that there
will be another moment given to you, and yet, that’s the most valuable thing
that can ever be given to us, this moment,
with all the opportunity that it contains. Does that mean that we can be grateful
for everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence,
for war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss
of a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn’t say we can be grateful
for everything. I said we can be grateful in every
given moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted
with something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity
that is given to us. So how can each one of us find
a method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful,
but moment by moment to be grateful? How can we do it? It’s a very simple method:
Stop. Look. Go. That’s all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life; we don’t stop. We miss the opportunity
because we don’t stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs
into our lives. And when you stop, then the next thing
is to look. You look. You open your eyes.
You open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this
wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,
our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,
to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts
to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us
to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers
to you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware
how important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,
you’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act
out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,
and you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying
the differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid
under which we live. What we need is a networking
of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups
who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

wonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,
and that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,
our hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,
to make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy
than when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts
to the opportunities, the opportunities invite us
to do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,
and really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers
to you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware
how important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,
you’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act
out of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,
and you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying
the differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid
under which we live. What we need is a networking
of smaller groups, smaller and smaller groups
who know one another, who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

**Transcript**:
You might think of gas masks as
clunky, spooky, military-looking devices only found in spy movies
or World War I museums. But you probably already own a mask
that uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may
need to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled
from 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,
their smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing
more hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production
of toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new
and old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is
making sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask
in the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants
in one of two ways: filtering them out by size or
attracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,
let’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate
a wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many
different pollutants at such high concentrations
that no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel
with their own air supply. But further away,
the situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid
or liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what
you're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous
for children, the elderly, and those with respiratory
or cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these
particulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene 
or glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,
they look like a thick forest, and at this scale, these branches
have a special property. Typically, when you use a sieve, you’re filtering out objects
larger than the sieve’s holes. But these polypropylene branches
can catch particles much smaller than the gaps between them. That’s because, when a particle
collides with a thread, van der Waals forces cause it to stick
as if it were made of Velcro. Plus, size-based filters can use
electrically charged fibers that attract particles not already
on a collision course. This is how even a simple N95 mask can
catch at least 95% of particulate matter. And why an N100 mask or an air purifier with a high efficiency
particulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will
filter out most airborne pollution. Unfortunately, some pollutants are still
too small for this approach, including ozone molecules. These are barely bigger than the oxygen
that we need to breathe and exposure is associated with asthma,
respiratory conditions, and even premature death. Our best chance to filter them
are activated carbon masks. At the microscopic level, activated carbon
looks like a vast black honeycomb, and it's highly microporous structure
can trap tiny ozone molecules. But this material still needs help
to capture other pollutants like hydrogen sulfide, chlorine,
and ammonia. For these threats, we need to combine
the activated carbon with some simple chemistry. If the pollutant is acidic, we can infuse
the filter with a basic chemical. Then when the two meet, they react,
and the gas is trapped. Similarly, we can use acids
to trap basic pollutants. Even with the right mask, it's still smart
to check air quality indicators and to stay indoors
when the threat level is high. And just like a mask, you'll want to make
sure your house is well sealed. You can do this by closing windows,
turning off fans that vent outside, and using HEPA filter equipped
air purifiers or their cheaper, DIY cousin,
the Corsi-Rosenthal box. Following these guidelines can help
us breathe easy as we work on preventing these pollutants
in the first place.

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
During an important calendrical
celebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat
atop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub
he’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast
K’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known
the crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing
agriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous
Central American settlements. This shifted the center
of their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,
and Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock
rapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities
to collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza
is pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an
abundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when
drought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become
the most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds
of kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s
population possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse
international culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining
a large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,
following K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted
from a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils
of the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with
destructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely
on economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might
into establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from
coastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,
turquoise, and jade from various parts
of Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted
sharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,
minerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood
from the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown
staple crops. Farming was essential
to Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious
practices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,
the transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built
a vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,
ballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple
to mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,
the feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s
central deity, and his worship transformed the city
into a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid
and temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs
with a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,
around each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows
that slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations
of Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited
by gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated
at Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence
of thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s
golden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit
and lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities
in nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the
watery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages
and the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself
through this extended drought. Population plummeted
during the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza
as the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully
abandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital
of a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name
was preserved, and its ancient stone constructions
were still standing, as they do to this day.
