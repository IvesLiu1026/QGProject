**Transcript**:
When you touch an object and it feels warm
or cold, what is that really telling you about the object? Here, I have a metal hard drive and a book
and I'm going to ask people to compare their temperatures. Which one do you think will feel warmer - the
book or the hard drive? The temperatures? Yeah, tell me if one is hotter or colder or
if they're the same temperature. How do they feel? This is slightly cooler than this one. Oh, that's warmer. Yeah, agreed. I'd say the hard drive is a lot colder than
the book. 'Cause the book's got more knowledge. Why do you think that is? Metal's normally a little bit chillier if
you leave it in a colder temperature. What if I said they're both the same temperature? What would you say? I'd tell you you're lying. I'd think you were lying, yeah. Well, maybe the way I can prove it is I have
an infrared thermometer. What do you think we're going to see? I think science might be able to answer that. And I'm not a scientist! Make a prediction for me. I still think that's colder. Would you bet me money? I don't have any cash. Let's measure the temperature of the book. What do you see? 19.0. OK. Now measure the temperature of that. 19.0. Alright, well, now I believe you. I'm trying to figure it out, actually. Trying to figure out why'd they be the same
temperature. They don't feel the same temperature, though. So, why does that feel colder if they're the
same? Good one. You know the answer? I'm coming to you guys for answers. We're creatives, not intellectuals. Well, create an answer for me! I'm not a scientist! Come on, you tell me. I'll try to answer that question with another
little experiment. Here is an aluminium block. Ooh! Nice and cold. And a plastic block. How do their temperatures compare? Completely different. Aluminium's going to be much colder. Yeah? This actually feels colder. Let's take this to the next level. I'll put an ice cube on both plates. What will we see? I'm guessing it would stay solid on this one
and melt on this one. So it's going to melt on the plastic but stay
solid on the aluminium? Yes, but maybe I'm wrong. That one will melt more quickly than on the
aluminium. You'd think so. Yeah, 'cause it's cold. I think they're the same. We put an ice cube on each of those. What do you see? It's melting quicker on the aluminium. My God, it's melting! This is melting quicker than that one, even
though this is aluminium and that's plastic. So which one felt colder? This one. How does that make sense? No idea. Could aluminium be bad for the environment? How would aluminium be bad for the environment? It's thawing the ice quicker, isn't it? You want the answer? Yes, please! It's about thermoconductivity - the rate at
which heat is transferred from one object to another. So when you felt these blocks originally,
I know this one felt a lot colder. But you know from the other example we did,
that they must both be the same temperature. True. They've both been outside for a while. We see the aluminium block is melting the
ice faster than the plastic block because it's conducting the heat to the ice cube faster. With the plastic block, it's a worse thermoconductor. So, heat is being transferred less quickly
to this ice block and so it's staying iced. OK. I believe you. Make sense? Yes. Definitely. In our first example, the hard drive felt
colder, even though it was at the same temperature as the book. That's because the aluminium conducts heat
away from your hand faster than the book conducts heat away from your hand. Sure. That seems logical. Which makes the hard drive feel colder and
the book feel warmer. So when you touch something, you don't actually
feel temperature. You feel the rate at which heat is conducted,
either towards or away from you. Think about this next time you hop out of
the shower in winter. It's much nicer to stand on the bath mat than
on a towel beside it. Not because the bath mat is warmer but because
it conducts heat less quickly away from you.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the temperature of the hard drive and the book, while the generated MCQs ask about thermoconductivity, heat transfer, and the sensation of feeling temperature.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the context of the transcript, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is slightly related, I would say Question 1, but it's not similar in terms of question intent, options, and content.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Here is an example:

Question: What was the temperature of both the hard drive and the book?
Options: A. 18.0°C, B. 19.0°C, C. 20.0°C, D. 21.0°C
Correct Option: B

This new MCQ matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Yeah. Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So I've seen enough videos on the internet of a mantis shrimp punching to have a good idea of what's going on, but I don't understand it, like at the mechanical level. So today on Smarter Every Day my sister has volunteered to model three seemingly unrelated objects to help us understand this a little bit better. But first, let's go to James Cook University and watch one punch in slow motion. OK where are we going? -We're gonna We're gonna go to a place called Yorkeys Knob. - Shut up! - That's the name of it. - To get some crabs. - We're not! - From Yorkeys Knob. (Destin) [laughs] I was hoping I could use that.. but... I can't. - It's true, the place is called Yorkeys Knob. (Destin) You weren't lying. So Yorkeys Knob, now I have to find crabs. - That one. That's a good one. Grab that one. Got him? -Got him. - There you go. Crabs in test tubes. (Destin) I have to say, I've never seen that before. - It works. It'll be cool. So what we'll do is we'll take one of the test tubes with the crab in it, we'll put the test tube down here which will keep the crab there. He'll come out and go.. bang.. hit the crab and smash the test tube. (Destin) Really? So the mantis shrimp is.. it's a peacock mantis shrimp. - Yep. - Look at that joker. It's pretty awesome. Hey don't they see more colors than any other animal? - Yeah. They've got incredible vision and their eyes are setup in parts of three. So the top bits look in a different part from the middle, which look at a different part from the bottom. - Kind of like the fovea on our eyes is different from.. - Yeah. - OK. - Out we come. Move little crab. [LOUD CLICK] - Bang! - It triggered. - Pull him out. [bang] [breaking glass] (Destin) Yeah, that's crazy. So let's back it up and watch again and you'll notice that there's a cavitation bubble generated at the exact point of impact. OK first of all, a mantis shrimp isn't even a shrimp. It's actually a stomatopod. We call it a shrimp because it kinda looks like it, but we also call it a mantis because it's similar to a preying mantis with its forearms. They have similar hunting strategies. Dr Seymour says that punch is so fast that it can't be accomplished by muscle movement alone, there has to be something else going on, which brings up Sheila Patek. Believe it or not, Dr Patek has determined that the shape of this potato chip is the secret to the punch of the mantis shrimp. Seriously. This shape is called a hyperbolic paraboloid, and if you've ever taken calculus you've seen it. It's basically a saddle shape and they're super strong. This saddle is located on top of the smasher, and the stomatopod uses his muscles to compress it like a spring and he holds it back with a latch mechanism. He then releases this potential energy and it drives the club forward at a much higher velocity than would be possible with muscle alone. So the next time you eat one of these remember there's another animal eating with the same shape you are, only he's doing it at the bottom of the ocean and he's got that shape integrated into the top of his arm. If you've ever played with a vice clamp before, you've seen this type of mechanism. You can slowly clamp down on the tool, which uses a cam-over action to lock it in place, and if you have it set right and squeeze it hard, you store mechanical strain energy. When you trip the latch the energy's released and the arm flies forward real fast, but think about this. Mantis shrimp use their little clubber to break open shells that are really hard right? So why does the shell break and the club doesn't? Let's watch another clip. This is Dr Seymour feeding a crab to the stomatopod except this time there's no test tube. - It's flicking the.. It's flicking the rock. Ohhhh! - Did you get it? - Dunno, might have. - Ohhhh I feel for that crab. [laughs] [bang] (Destin) Watch again closer and see if you can see the saddle release the energy. - Look at that. - Good grief. Snapped it straight in half. We're talking about serious forces here. In engineering we take two materials and we combine them together into composites to make them stronger. For example plywood is made of many layers of wood with the fibers oriented in two different directions. Mantis shrimps however take this to the next level with an organic polymer called chitin. At the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard, they determined that these fibers aren't rotated only in two principle directions like plywood, it's an entire helix, which gives the structure strength in many different directions. These strands are then bonded together in a mineralized matrix which makes the whole thing an incredibly strong smasher. But it gets crazier than that. The team put a section of the smasher in a synchrotron so they could analyze the material makeup. A synchrotron! That's like a particle accelerator. This is crazy science. They bombarded it hundreds of times to understand the density and the local orientation of the crystals in the material, and guess what. They found that the crystals near the surface were oriented perpendicular to the impact site and that orientation changed as we move away from the impact site. Basically the material changes composition and strength at different locations on the inside. The impact surface is incredibly hard, but the internal structure transitions smoothly to allow the distribution of a huge impulse load throughout the rest of that structure so it can punch stuff all day long without breaking. So instead of a normal composite like plywood, which are identical layers stacked up and glued together, a mantis shrimp club is a variable composite, meaning you can vary the material makeup and the strength orientation wherever you need it. This is an incredibly smart way to design a system. In summary, I want you to love the mantis shrimp. I don't want you to love it just because of the mechanics of how it throws the punch. Not because of the chemistry of the variable composition of the crystalline structure. The optics.. It can see circularly polarized light. This is an incredible, incredible animal, and I want you to think about it every time you eat a chip like this. Can you do that for me? OK I hope you enjoyed learning how mantis shrimp club. It's all about the hyperbolic paraboloid, or as my Cal 3 teacher taught me, hyperbowic pawabawoid. Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one. It's Derek! He video bombed me. [laugh] (Destin) Ho! - [ laughs] We could bring the lighting down on the chip please. Perfect. [laughs] That was really dumb. (Destin) Which is why I think I'm gonna use it.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 2: According to Dr. Seymour, what is the secret to the mantis shrimp's powerful punch? Options: A. The speed of its muscles, B. The shape of its club, specifically the hyperbolic paraboloid, C. The type of food it eats, D. The size of its club Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that asks about the origin of the mantis shrimp's name.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of the mantis shrimp's name or classification, I would choose:

**Question 1: What is the name of the location where Destin and his sister go to catch crabs for the mantis shrimp experiment? Options: A. Yorkeys Knob, B. James Cook University, C. The Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, D. Harvard University Correct Option: A**

This question is not similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content, but it does mention the mantis shrimp. However, I must note that this is a weak match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 1**, but with the caveat that it's not a strong match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ. One possible generated MCQ could be:

**Question: Why is the mantis shrimp called a "shrimp" despite not being a true shrimp? Options: A. It eats a lot of shrimp, B. It looks like a shrimp and a preying mantis, C. It mimics a shrimp's swimming abilities, D. Its primary source of food is the mantis**

This generated MCQ is a much stronger match to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In this short video,
we're going to show you how we constructed and animated a pop-up book 
to explain Earth's tectonic plates. The supercontinent Pangaea
broke apart 200,000,000 years ago, but the pieces haven't stopped shifting. Although with animation we can show
this movement easily with drawings, we thought it'd be more interesting
to depict gigantic sliding slabs of rock using a tangible object
that also moves and shifts. and the pop-up book idea was born. (music) To make your own pop-up book,
you'll need some basic paper tools, such as scissors, an X-Acto knife, glue,
double-sided Scotch tape, a ruler, a bone folder or other creasing tool,
and, of course, some paper. For this lesson, 
we first determined the visual style by making illustrations and 
deciding on the overall design, colors, shapes and elements
we wanted on each page, or spread. You can have more detailed illustrations,
but we wanted to illustrate this lesson simply by playing with shapes and colors. When you visualize your pop-up
and choose a visual style, you will want to make a bunch of
good old pencil sketches on paper and plan each movement for each spread. Plan as much as you can: all the basic shapes and how they connect
and how you want them to move, which parts you want to pop-up first. Challenge yourself, and explore multiple possibilities of how your 
main element on the spread can pop up. For the next step,
make a mock-up spread and see if your masterful 
paper engineering ideas translate from a sketch
to the actual prototype. Instead of using fancy paper,
start with the cheap stuff and allow yourself to make 
mistakes and adjustments. This prototype lets you see
how your preliminary sketches will come to life. You will want to first draw
all individual parts on a single sheet, including all your main pieces,
all the supporting pieces and the folds. You may be surprised 
that there are only two types of folds that can make your elements pop up
the way you want: a step fold and a V-fold. Here, you can see how we
used a step fold to make each layer
of the Earth step out. Then, cut all your individual elements
and assemble using glue or double-sided Scotch tape. (Music) Through trial and error,
make sure that all the elements, shapes and placements
are moving the way you imagined, and that they fold properly 
when closed and opened. (Music) Once your prototype is tested
and complete, you can proceed to making the final
product in color. Draw or paint on your main pop-up
elements as you see fit. For this lesson, we decided to just play with simple shapes
in different colors to create the world of shifting
continents we imagined. (Music) When we were planning each spread,
we knew we wanted some elements to move independently 
of the typical pop-up book using slight manipulations and animations. We had to plan well,
but also use a few tricks. As always, when you're making 
stop-motion, you may have to be creative and
use all sorts of unusual tools and props to achieve the effect that you want. In this shot, the birds had to fly
across and off the edge of the book, so we used Fun-Tak to move
the clouds across the page. Once they left the page,
they had to be trimmed to get the illusion they flew off. When the pages of the book
close at the end, we had to flip each page,
supporting it in each position long enough to be photographed
as an individual frame. We used binder clips,
wedges, Fun-Tak, and almost every handy
little thing you can think of. Once all the individual frames
were photographed, we put them all together
and composited to make our pop-up book
look like it's moving on its own. So now, think of a special occasion where you can surprise someone
with your own unique pop-up card, or an entire story that you want to tell, and start plotting the ins and outs
of your pop-up book.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 3: What was the name of the supercontinent that broke apart 200,000,000 years ago? Options: A. Pangaea, B. Gondwana, C. Laurasia, D. Rodinia Correct Option: A**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only asks about the name of the supercontinent, whereas the ground truth MCQ asks about the movement of the plates after the break-up.

A more suitable match would be a question that asks about the movement of the plates. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the content and intent, I would choose:

**Question 1: What was the main reason for using a pop-up book to explain Earth's tectonic plates? Options: A. To showcase complex illustrations, B. To make the concept more engaging and interactive, C. To create a decorative object, D. To write a scientific paper Correct Option: B**

This question is not a perfect match, but it is related to the topic of tectonic plates and the use of a pop-up book to explain the concept.

However, I must note that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a new question that specifically asks about the movement of the plates after the break-up of Pangaea would be a more suitable match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

are moving the way you imagined, and that they fold properly 
when closed and opened. (Music) Once your prototype is tested
and complete, you can proceed to making the final
product in color. Draw or paint on your main pop-up
elements as you see fit. For this lesson, we decided to just play with simple shapes
in different colors to create the world of shifting
continents we imagined. (Music) When we were planning each spread,
we knew we wanted some elements to move independently 
of the typical pop-up book using slight manipulations and animations. We had to plan well,
but also use a few tricks. As always, when you're making 
stop-motion, you may have to be creative and
use all sorts of unusual tools and props to achieve the effect that you want. In this shot, the birds had to fly
across and off the edge of the book, so we used Fun-Tak to move
the clouds across the page. Once they left the page,
they had to be trimmed to get the illusion they flew off. When the pages of the book
close at the end, we had to flip each page,
supporting it in each position long enough to be photographed
as an individual frame. We used binder clips,
wedges, Fun-Tak, and almost every handy
little thing you can think of. Once all the individual frames
were photographed, we put them all together
and composited to make our pop-up book
look like it's moving on its own. So now, think of a special occasion where you can surprise someone
with your own unique pop-up card, or an entire story that you want to tell, and start plotting the ins and outs
of your pop-up book.

**Transcript**:
In this short video,
we're going to show you how we constructed and animated a pop-up book 
to explain Earth's tectonic plates. The supercontinent Pangaea
broke apart 200,000,000 years ago, but the pieces haven't stopped shifting. Although with animation we can show
this movement easily with drawings, we thought it'd be more interesting
to depict gigantic sliding slabs of rock using a tangible object
that also moves and shifts. and the pop-up book idea was born. (music) To make your own pop-up book,
you'll need some basic paper tools, such as scissors, an X-Acto knife, glue,
double-sided Scotch tape, a ruler, a bone folder or other creasing tool,
and, of course, some paper. For this lesson, 
we first determined the visual style by making illustrations and 
deciding on the overall design, colors, shapes and elements
we wanted on each page, or spread. You can have more detailed illustrations,
but we wanted to illustrate this lesson simply by playing with shapes and colors. When you visualize your pop-up
and choose a visual style, you will want to make a bunch of
good old pencil sketches on paper and plan each movement for each spread. Plan as much as you can: all the basic shapes and how they connect
and how you want them to move, which parts you want to pop-up first. Challenge yourself, and explore multiple possibilities of how your 
main element on the spread can pop up. For the next step,
make a mock-up spread and see if your masterful 
paper engineering ideas translate from a sketch
to the actual prototype. Instead of using fancy paper,
start with the cheap stuff and allow yourself to make 
mistakes and adjustments. This prototype lets you see
how your preliminary sketches will come to life. You will want to first draw
all individual parts on a single sheet, including all your main pieces,
all the supporting pieces and the folds. You may be surprised 
that there are only two types of folds that can make your elements pop up
the way you want: a step fold and a V-fold. Here, you can see how we
used a step fold to make each layer
of the Earth step out. Then, cut all your individual elements
and assemble using glue or double-sided Scotch tape. (Music) Through trial and error,
make sure that all the elements, shapes and placements
are moving the way you imagined, and that they fold properly 
when closed and opened. (Music) Once your prototype is tested
and complete, you can proceed to making the final

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] Science is coming. [MUSIC] The Game of Thrones universe is one of the most brilliantly complex and utterly FRUSTRATING
fictional universes ever created. But it IS a fictional universe, and the only
rule of a fictional universe is that it is SELF-consistent. It doesn't have to agree
with our science, or logic, or even our commonly agreed-upon moral code that says killing people
is not a good thing. There is only one god in that universe, and his name is Gurm.
But despite that, many things in Game of Thrones can be linked to the real, ACTUAL world, drawing
inspiration as if through the thirsty roots of a weirwood tree. Many of these connections
are interpreted by fans, but some have been verified by the bearded one himself.
There are the many competing religious philosophies, the many, many, MANY similarities to real-life
historical characters or the fact that they LOOK like us? But we are not going to be talking
about those... Here's where I would give you a spoilers warning,
but . . . come on. You clicked on this. Spoilers are coming.
Why are the seasons so crazy? In the Game of Thrones universe winters and summers are
known to last years at a time and apparently show up when they damn well please. We know
that the summer/winter cycle normally averages around 5 or 6 years apiece, and as the story
begins the most recent summer has stretched to nearly ten years. On Earth, seasons are
caused by our axial tilt leaning one side of Earth toward or away from the sun during
our annual trip around it, but George's world isn't so predictable.
The Maesters of the Citadel are the geeks of Westeros, who are supposed to calculate
when the next Polar Doom will arrive. Westeros isn't an industrial society, but the architecture,
metallurgy, and medicine we see in the Known World suggests that these guys are a fairly
scientific bunch. Many theories have attempted to explain the
reason for these seasons, but most of them collapse faster than a Greyjoy's loyalty.
We know that the Westeros-ian world has a moon, and that it used to have two. Maybe
their moon isn't as large as ours so the planet's axis, unstabilized by lunar gravity, wobbles
like a broken top. But, according to astronomers, moons don't stabilize planets, rather a moonless
planet should spin more evenly than one with a moon.
Then what if its orbit, instead of a nearly circular ellipse, like ours, was extremely
elongated? Well that doesn't work either. While it could cause extreme seasons, they'd
still show up on a regular schedule. Even complex combinations of orbital stretches
and wobbles, like Earth's Milankovitch cycles, could be predicted by any society that knows
basic algebra. Well, then maybe it's tugged on by the gravity
of a neighboring planet, or its sun has a variable output. George R.R. Martin did write
his first novel about a planet falling away from its parent star.
It's most likely that the Game of Thrones planet . . . it needs a name. Planet Hodor!
lives in a very strange solar system, around a pair of stars. Last April, a group of graduate
students from Johns Hopkins University published a paper showing that if the world of Game
of Thrones was subject to the complex dynamics of three celestial bodies orbiting each other,
predicting a planet's seasons would be impossible. This has interesting implications for Tatooine
. . ? Of course, it could also be due to magic,
which is cheating. And what about that world anyway? At the amazing
planetary science blog Generation Anthropocene, Miles Traer and Mike Osborne have constructed
a detailed geologic history of Westeros stretching back more than 500 million years into the
fictional past. They determined that, since the North is cold
enough to maintain a wall of ice, which we'll come back to, year-round, it must be near
this planet's Arctic circle, and since the south is warm enough to be covered by deserts,
which primarily exist near Earth's 30th parallel that Planet Hodor has a radius of 4,297 miles
or about 10% wider than Earth. We know that the First Men crossed into Westeros
on a land bridge near Dorne, and like Africa and South America, the coastlines of Westeros
and Essos seem to fit like puzzle pieces. They were probably unzipped beginning 25 million
years ago by a spreading rift, like the one in the middle of our Atlantic Ocean.
And 40 million years ago, Westeros was likely covered by a huge ice sheet, which retreated
as glaciers, cutting the great valleys south of Winterfell and the Riverlands between Harrenhal
and The Twins. The description of the jagged Black Mountains
sounds a lot like our own Rocky Mountains, which were born around 60-80 million years
ago. This would also mark the birth of the Mountains of the Moon and the high Westerlands,
as north and south Westeros smashed together just like the fault beneath the Himalayas.
That violent uplift is what exposed all that Lannister gold from its origin deep within
the crust. That era also would have borne the Iron Islands . . . but we have a different
iron to talk about. Valyrian steel was an alloy forged in the
ancient empire of the Valyrians, lighter and stronger than regular steel, and whose secrets
were lost during the Great Doom, when volcanoes torched Valyria, and its dragons, into charcoal.
That Valyrian steel was forged with dragon fire, which is not actually a thing, but it's
almost certainly a reference to Damscus steel, an ancient steel alloy developed in India
around 300 BC. Like Valyrian steel, the secrets of its forgery were lost to history forever.
Speaking of dragon fire . . . what if dragons COULD exist? How COULD a living thing breathe
flames? My buddy Kyle Hill came up with an interesting
theory. Like the tiny bombardier beetle, dragons could secrete reactive "hypergolic" chemicals
that, when mixed, react violently and shoot out of an orifice like rocket fuel.
And if dragons chewed on certain rocks and metals, which I imagine are like cupcakes
to them, they could coat their teeth in minerals, creating a spark with rows of deadly knife-like
flint and steel. Unfortunately, our idea of a fire-breathing
flying dragon is about to come crashing back down to Earth, because physics. As Bran Stark
found out the hard way, gravity seems to work in Westeros just like it does here. And that
means the Mother of Dragons' kids are grounded. The largest bird that ever lived was the giant
teratorn, with a wingspan of 7 meters. Not big enough.
Dragons are probably more like pterosaurs. But even the largest of those, Quetzalcoatlus,
maxed out at 11 meters from wingtip to wingtip and 250 kg. But Daenarys' dragons are bigger
than that by the time they hit puberty, and dragon lore says they never stop growing.
Even with a pterosaur's hollow bones, ability to gallop on all fours to take off and huge
stretchy wings, even Hodor could figure out that the dragons don't work. Unless, yeah
. . . magic. The Wall? Won't work. A sheer cliff of solid
ice stacked 700 feet tall would melt at the bottom under its own weight and would fall
apart unless it was sloped Wildfire? Works. "Greek Fire" was an ancient
precursor to napalm made from petroleum, sulfur, saltpeter and was the most potent weapon of
its time. Add a little trimethyl borate, and you've got a flaming death that's ready for
St. Patrick's Day. Milk of poppy? Works. Our opiate drugs from
morphine to vicodin to even heroin are all derived from the poppy plant.
Dire Wolf? Works. The extinct Canis dirus was the largest wolf to ever exist, covering
North and South America, thousands have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits alone.
Of course, the universe of Game of Thrones would live . . . or die . . . just fine whether
or not it agrees with our science. But by combining the two, as Raymond Chandler said,
The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art
from becoming ridiculous What do you think? Does bringing science into
a fantasy story kill the wonder like a guest at the red wedding? Or does it help the fictional
world . . . truly "exist" in our own? I think it makes the story richer than a Lannister.

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] Science is coming. [MUSIC] The Game of Thrones universe is one of the most brilliantly complex and utterly FRUSTRATING
fictional universes ever created. But it IS a fictional universe, and the only
rule of a fictional universe is that it is SELF-consistent. It doesn't have to agree
with our science, or logic, or even our commonly agreed-upon moral code that says killing people
is not a good thing. There is only one god in that universe, and his name is Gurm.
But despite that, many things in Game of Thrones can be linked to the real, ACTUAL world, drawing
inspiration as if through the thirsty roots of a weirwood tree. Many of these connections
are interpreted by fans, but some have been verified by the bearded one himself.
There are the many competing religious philosophies, the many, many, MANY similarities to real-life
historical characters or the fact that they LOOK like us? But we are not going to be talking
about those... Here's where I would give you a spoilers warning,
but . . . come on. You clicked on this. Spoilers are coming.
Why are the seasons so crazy? In the Game of Thrones universe winters and summers are
known to last years at a time and apparently show up when they damn well please. We know
that the summer/winter cycle normally averages around 5 or 6 years apiece, and as the story
begins the most recent summer has stretched to nearly ten years. On Earth, seasons are
caused by our axial tilt leaning one side of Earth toward or away from the sun during
our annual trip around it, but George's world isn't so predictable.
The Maesters of the Citadel are the geeks of Westeros, who are supposed to calculate
when the next Polar Doom will arrive. Westeros isn't an industrial society, but the architecture,
metallurgy, and medicine we see in the Known World suggests that these guys are a fairly
scientific bunch. Many theories have attempted to explain the
reason for these seasons, but most of them collapse faster than a Greyjoy's loyalty.
We know that the Westeros-ian world has a moon, and that it used to have two. Maybe
their moon isn't as large as ours so the planet's axis, unstabilized by lunar gravity, wobbles
like a broken top. But, according to astronomers, moons don't stabilize planets, rather a moonless
planet should spin more evenly than one with a moon.
Then what if its orbit, instead of a nearly circular ellipse, like ours, was extremely
elongated? Well that doesn't work either. While it could cause extreme seasons, they'd
still show up on a regular schedule. Even complex combinations of orbital stretches
and wobbles, like Earth's Milankovitch cycles, could be predicted by any society that knows
basic algebra. Well, then maybe it's tugged on by the gravity
of a neighboring planet, or its sun has a variable output. George R.R. Martin did write
his first novel about a planet falling away from its parent star.
It's most likely that the Game of Thrones planet . . . it needs a name. Planet Hodor!
lives in a very strange solar system, around a pair of stars. Last April, a group of graduate
students from Johns Hopkins University published a paper showing that if the world of Game
of Thrones was subject to the complex dynamics of three celestial bodies orbiting each other,
predicting a planet's seasons would be impossible. This has interesting implications for Tatooine
. . ? Of course, it could also be due to magic,
which is cheating. And what about that world anyway? At the amazing
planetary science blog Generation Anthropocene, Miles Traer and Mike Osborne have constructed
a detailed geologic history of Westeros stretching back more than 500 million years into the
fictional past. They determined that, since the North is cold
enough to maintain a wall of ice, which we'll come back to, year-round, it must be near
this planet's Arctic circle, and since the south is warm enough to be covered by deserts,
which primarily exist near Earth's 30th parallel that Planet Hodor has a radius of 4,297 miles
or about 10% wider than Earth. We know that the First Men crossed into Westeros
on a land bridge near Dorne, and like Africa and South America, the coastlines of Westeros
and Essos seem to fit like puzzle pieces. They were probably unzipped beginning 25 million
years ago by a spreading rift, like the one in the middle of our Atlantic Ocean.
And 40 million years ago, Westeros was likely covered by a huge ice sheet, which retreated
as glaciers, cutting the great valleys south of Winterfell and the Riverlands between Harrenhal
and The Twins. The description of the jagged Black Mountains
sounds a lot like our own Rocky Mountains, which were born around 60-80 million years
ago. This would also mark the birth of the Mountains of the Moon and the high Westerlands,
as north and south Westeros smashed together just like the fault beneath the Himalayas.
That violent uplift is what exposed all that Lannister gold from its origin deep within
the crust. That era also would have borne the Iron Islands . . . but we have a different
iron to talk about. Valyrian steel was an alloy forged in the
ancient empire of the Valyrians, lighter and stronger than regular steel, and whose secrets
were lost during the Great Doom, when volcanoes torched Valyria, and its dragons, into charcoal.
That Valyrian steel was forged with dragon fire, which is not actually a thing, but it's
almost certainly a reference to Damscus steel, an ancient steel alloy developed in India
around 300 BC. Like Valyrian steel, the secrets of its forgery were lost to history forever.
Speaking of dragon fire . . . what if dragons COULD exist? How COULD a living thing breathe
flames? My buddy Kyle Hill came up with an interesting
theory. Like the tiny bombardier beetle, dragons could secrete reactive "hypergolic" chemicals
that, when mixed, react violently and shoot out of an orifice like rocket fuel.
And if dragons chewed on certain rocks and metals, which I imagine are like cupcakes
to them, they could coat their teeth in minerals, creating a spark with rows of deadly knife-like
flint and steel. Unfortunately, our idea of a fire-breathing
flying dragon is about to come crashing back down to Earth, because physics. As Bran Stark
found out the hard way, gravity seems to work in Westeros just like it does here. And that
means the Mother of Dragons' kids are grounded. The largest bird that ever lived was the giant
teratorn, with a wingspan of 7 meters. Not big enough.
Dragons are probably more like pterosaurs. But even the largest of those, Quetzalcoatlus,
maxed out at 11 meters from wingtip to wingtip and 250 kg. But Daenarys' dragons are bigger
than that by the time they hit puberty, and dragon lore says they never stop growing.
Even with a pterosaur's hollow bones, ability to gallop on all fours to take off and huge
stretchy wings, even Hodor could figure out that the dragons don't work. Unless, yeah
. . . magic. The Wall? Won't work. A sheer cliff of solid
ice stacked 700 feet tall would melt at the bottom under its own weight and would fall
apart unless it was sloped Wildfire? Works. "Greek Fire" was an ancient
precursor to napalm made from petroleum, sulfur, saltpeter and was the most potent weapon of
its time. Add a little trimethyl borate, and you've got a flaming death that's ready for
St. Patrick's Day. Milk of poppy? Works. Our opiate drugs from
morphine to vicodin to even heroin are all derived from the poppy plant.
Dire Wolf? Works. The extinct Canis dirus was the largest wolf to ever exist, covering
North and South America, thousands have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits alone.
Of course, the universe of Game of Thrones would live . . . or die . . . just fine whether

**Transcript**:
[MUSIC] Science is coming. [MUSIC] The Game of Thrones universe is one of the most brilliantly complex and utterly FRUSTRATING
fictional universes ever created. But it IS a fictional universe, and the only
rule of a fictional universe is that it is SELF-consistent. It doesn't have to agree
with our science, or logic, or even our commonly agreed-upon moral code that says killing people
is not a good thing. There is only one god in that universe, and his name is Gurm.
But despite that, many things in Game of Thrones can be linked to the real, ACTUAL world, drawing
inspiration as if through the thirsty roots of a weirwood tree. Many of these connections
are interpreted by fans, but some have been verified by the bearded one himself.
There are the many competing religious philosophies, the many, many, MANY similarities to real-life
historical characters or the fact that they LOOK like us? But we are not going to be talking
about those... Here's where I would give you a spoilers warning,
but . . . come on. You clicked on this. Spoilers are coming.
Why are the seasons so crazy? In the Game of Thrones universe winters and summers are
known to last years at a time and apparently show up when they damn well please. We know
that the summer/winter cycle normally averages around 5 or 6 years apiece, and as the story
begins the most recent summer has stretched to nearly ten years. On Earth, seasons are
caused by our axial tilt leaning one side of Earth toward or away from the sun during
our annual trip around it, but George's world isn't so predictable.
The Maesters of the Citadel are the geeks of Westeros, who are supposed to calculate
when the next Polar Doom will arrive. Westeros isn't an industrial society, but the architecture,
metallurgy, and medicine we see in the Known World suggests that these guys are a fairly
scientific bunch. Many theories have attempted to explain the
reason for these seasons, but most of them collapse faster than a Greyjoy's loyalty.
We know that the Westeros-ian world has a moon, and that it used to have two. Maybe
their moon isn't as large as ours so the planet's axis, unstabilized by lunar gravity, wobbles
like a broken top. But, according to astronomers, moons don't stabilize planets, rather a moonless
planet should spin more evenly than one with a moon.
Then what if its orbit, instead of a nearly circular ellipse, like ours, was extremely
elongated? Well that doesn't work either. While it could cause extreme seasons, they'd
still show up on a regular schedule. Even complex combinations of orbital stretches
and wobbles, like Earth's Milankovitch cycles, could be predicted by any society that knows
basic algebra. Well, then maybe it's tugged on by the gravity
of a neighboring planet, or its sun has a variable output. George R.R. Martin did write
his first novel about a planet falling away from its parent star.
It's most likely that the Game of Thrones planet . . . it needs a name. Planet Hodor!
lives in a very strange solar system, around a pair of stars. Last April, a group of graduate
students from Johns Hopkins University published a paper showing that if the world of Game
of Thrones was subject to the complex dynamics of three celestial bodies orbiting each other,
predicting a planet's seasons would be impossible. This has interesting implications for Tatooine
. . ? Of course, it could also be due to magic,
which is cheating. And what about that world anyway? At the amazing
planetary science blog Generation Anthropocene, Miles Traer and Mike Osborne have constructed
a detailed geologic history of Westeros stretching back more than 500 million years into the
fictional past. They determined that, since the North is cold
enough to maintain a wall of ice, which we'll come back to, year-round, it must be near
this planet's Arctic circle, and since the south is warm enough to be covered by deserts,
which primarily exist near Earth's 30th parallel that Planet Hodor has a radius of 4,297 miles
or about 10% wider than Earth. We know that the First Men crossed into Westeros
on a land bridge near Dorne, and like Africa and South America, the coastlines of Westeros
and Essos seem to fit like puzzle pieces. They were probably unzipped beginning 25 million
years ago by a spreading rift, like the one in the middle of our Atlantic Ocean.
And 40 million years ago, Westeros was likely covered by a huge ice sheet, which retreated
as glaciers, cutting the great valleys south of Winterfell and the Riverlands between Harrenhal
and The Twins. The description of the jagged Black Mountains
sounds a lot like our own Rocky Mountains, which were born around 60-80 million years
ago. This would also mark the birth of the Mountains of the Moon and the high Westerlands,
as north and south Westeros smashed together just like the fault beneath the Himalayas.
That violent uplift is what exposed all that Lannister gold from its origin deep within
the crust. That era also would have borne the Iron Islands . . . but we have a different
iron to talk about. Valyrian steel was an alloy forged in the
ancient empire of the Valyrians, lighter and stronger than regular steel, and whose secrets
were lost during the Great Doom, when volcanoes torched Valyria, and its dragons, into charcoal.
That Valyrian steel was forged with dragon fire, which is not actually a thing, but it's
almost certainly a reference to Damscus steel, an ancient steel alloy developed in India
around 300 BC. Like Valyrian steel, the secrets of its forgery were lost to history forever.
Speaking of dragon fire . . . what if dragons COULD exist? How COULD a living thing breathe
flames? My buddy Kyle Hill came up with an interesting
theory. Like the tiny bombardier beetle, dragons could secrete reactive "hypergolic" chemicals
that, when mixed, react violently and shoot out of an orifice like rocket fuel.
And if dragons chewed on certain rocks and metals, which I imagine are like cupcakes
to them, they could coat their teeth in minerals, creating a spark with rows of deadly knife-like
flint and steel. Unfortunately, our idea of a fire-breathing
flying dragon is about to come crashing back down to Earth, because physics. As Bran Stark
found out the hard way, gravity seems to work in Westeros just like it does here. And that
means the Mother of Dragons' kids are grounded. The largest bird that ever lived was the giant
teratorn, with a wingspan of 7 meters. Not big enough.
Dragons are probably more like pterosaurs. But even the largest of those, Quetzalcoatlus,
maxed out at 11 meters from wingtip to wingtip and 250 kg. But Daenarys' dragons are bigger
than that by the time they hit puberty, and dragon lore says they never stop growing.
Even with a pterosaur's hollow bones, ability to gallop on all fours to take off and huge
stretchy wings, even Hodor could figure out that the dragons don't work. Unless, yeah
. . . magic. The Wall? Won't work. A sheer cliff of solid
ice stacked 700 feet tall would melt at the bottom under its own weight and would fall
apart unless it was sloped Wildfire? Works. "Greek Fire" was an ancient
precursor to napalm made from petroleum, sulfur, saltpeter and was the most potent weapon of
its time. Add a little trimethyl borate, and you've got a flaming death that's ready for
St. Patrick's Day. Milk of poppy? Works. Our opiate drugs from
morphine to vicodin to even heroin are all derived from the poppy plant.
Dire Wolf? Works. The extinct Canis dirus was the largest wolf to ever exist, covering
North and South America, thousands have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits alone.
Of course, the universe of Game of Thrones would live . . . or die . . . just fine whether
or not it agrees with our science. But by combining the two, as Raymond Chandler said,
The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art
from becoming ridiculous What do you think? Does bringing science into
a fantasy story kill the wonder like a guest at the red wedding? Or does it help the fictional
world . . . truly "exist" in our own? I think it makes the story richer than a Lannister.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 2 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the cause of seasons on Earth, while Question 2 asks about the reason for the crazy seasons in the Game of Thrones universe. Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the topic of seasons and their causes.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, I would say that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 2 is the closest.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the meaning of the word "consonance" in a musical context, while the generated MCQs are all related to jazz dance.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall theme of music and harmony, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match. This question asks about the key elements of jazz dance, which includes syncopated rhythms and improvisation, and option D mentions "All of the above", which could be related to harmony.

But, I must emphasize that this is a very weak match, and the generated MCQs do not adequately match the ground truth MCQ.

Flatulence, or passing gas,
is a normal daily phenomenon. Most individuals, yes,
that includes you, will make anywhere 
from 500-1500 milliliters of gas and can pass gas ten to twenty
times a day. But where does this bodily gas come from? A small proportion may come from
ingesting air during sleep, or at other times, but the majority of gas is produced by
bacteria in our intestines as they digest parts of food which we cannot. Our intestine is home to
trillions of bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with us. We provide them with a safe place
to stay and food to eat. In exchange, they help us 
extract energy from our food, make vitamins for us, like vitamin B and K,
boost our immune system, and play an important role in 
gastrointestinal barrier function, motility and the development of 
various organ systems. Clearly, it's in our best interest
to keep these bacteria happy. Gut bacteria get their nutrition
primarily from undigested food, such as carbohydrates and proteins,
which come to the large intestine. They ferment this undigested food
to produce a wide range of compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids
and, of course, gases. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
are the most common gaseous products of bacterial fermentation, 
and are odorless. Some people also produce methane due to
specific microbes present in their gut. But methane is actually odorless, too. Well then, what stinks? The foul smell is usually due to 
volatile sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and
methanethiol, or methyl mercaptan. These gases, however, constitute
less than 1% of volume, and are often seen with ingestion
of amino acids containing sulfur, which may explain the foul smell of gas
from certain high protein diets. Increased passage of gas is commonly
noticed after eating foods with high amounts of 
indigestible carbohydrates, like beans, lentils, dairy products,
onions, garlic, leeks, radishes, potatoes, oats, wheat, cauliflower,
broccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts. Humans lack the enzymes, so the bacteria able to ferment 
complex carbohydrates take over, and this naturally leads to more
gas than usual. But if you feel uncomfortable,
bloated or visibly distended, this may indicate impaired movement
of gas along the gastrointestinal track. It's important not to just 
blame certain foods for gas and bloating and then avoid them. You don't want to starve the bacteria
that digest these complex carbohydrates, or they'll have to start eating the sugars
in the mucus lining of your intestines. Your personal gas will vary
based on what you eat, and what bacteria are in your gut. For example, from the same starting sugar, the bacteria clostridium produces
carbon dioxide, butyrate and hydrogen, while propionibacterium can produce
carbon dioxide, propionate and acetate. At the same time, methanogens
can use hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced by other bacteria
to generate methane, which can reduce the total volume of gas 
by using up hydrogen and carbon dioxide. So there's a complex web among
intestinal bacteria allowing them to flourish by either
directly consuming undigested food, or using what other bacteria produce. This interaction largely determines
the amount and type of gas produced, so gas production is a sign
that your gut bacteria are at work. But in some instances, people may
develop abnormal increased flatulence. A common example is lactose intolerance. Most individuals have the enzyme for
breaking down lactose, a sugar present in milk and
milk-derived products. But some people either lack it entirely,
or have a reduced amount, such as after a gastrointestinal infection, so they're unable to digest
lactose products and may experience cramping, along with increased flatulence 
due to bacterial fermentation. But remember, most gas is produced as a natural result of bacterial 
fermentation in the intestine, and indicates healthy 
functioning of the gut. The amount and type can vary based on your
diet and the bacteria in your intestine. Exercise social courtesy while passing gas,
and do try to forgive your bacteria. They're only trying to be helpful.

blame certain foods for gas and bloating and then avoid them. You don't want to starve the bacteria
that digest these complex carbohydrates, or they'll have to start eating the sugars
in the mucus lining of your intestines. Your personal gas will vary
based on what you eat, and what bacteria are in your gut. For example, from the same starting sugar, the bacteria clostridium produces
carbon dioxide, butyrate and hydrogen, while propionibacterium can produce
carbon dioxide, propionate and acetate. At the same time, methanogens
can use hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced by other bacteria
to generate methane, which can reduce the total volume of gas 
by using up hydrogen and carbon dioxide. So there's a complex web among
intestinal bacteria allowing them to flourish by either
directly consuming undigested food, or using what other bacteria produce. This interaction largely determines
the amount and type of gas produced, so gas production is a sign
that your gut bacteria are at work. But in some instances, people may
develop abnormal increased flatulence. A common example is lactose intolerance. Most individuals have the enzyme for
breaking down lactose, a sugar present in milk and
milk-derived products. But some people either lack it entirely,
or have a reduced amount, such as after a gastrointestinal infection, so they're unable to digest
lactose products and may experience cramping, along with increased flatulence 
due to bacterial fermentation. But remember, most gas is produced as a natural result of bacterial 
fermentation in the intestine, and indicates healthy 
functioning of the gut. The amount and type can vary based on your
diet and the bacteria in your intestine. Exercise social courtesy while passing gas,
and do try to forgive your bacteria. They're only trying to be helpful.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 6: "What happens if the bacteria that digest complex carbohydrates are starved?" is related to the relationship between humans and bacteria in the gut.

However, a closer match is not present in the generated MCQs. If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9: "What is the relationship between the gut bacteria and the production of gas in the gut?" is the most similar, as it discusses the relationship between gut bacteria and humans, although it does not specifically mention the benefits of this relationship.

Therefore, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 9, with the understanding that it is not an exact match.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Flatulence, or passing gas,
is a normal daily phenomenon. Most individuals, yes,
that includes you, will make anywhere 
from 500-1500 milliliters of gas and can pass gas ten to twenty
times a day. But where does this bodily gas come from? A small proportion may come from
ingesting air during sleep, or at other times, but the majority of gas is produced by
bacteria in our intestines as they digest parts of food which we cannot. Our intestine is home to
trillions of bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with us. We provide them with a safe place
to stay and food to eat. In exchange, they help us 
extract energy from our food, make vitamins for us, like vitamin B and K,
boost our immune system, and play an important role in 
gastrointestinal barrier function, motility and the development of 
various organ systems. Clearly, it's in our best interest
to keep these bacteria happy. Gut bacteria get their nutrition
primarily from undigested food, such as carbohydrates and proteins,
which come to the large intestine. They ferment this undigested food
to produce a wide range of compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids
and, of course, gases. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
are the most common gaseous products of bacterial fermentation, 
and are odorless. Some people also produce methane due to
specific microbes present in their gut. But methane is actually odorless, too. Well then, what stinks? The foul smell is usually due to 
volatile sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and
methanethiol, or methyl mercaptan. These gases, however, constitute
less than 1% of volume, and are often seen with ingestion
of amino acids containing sulfur, which may explain the foul smell of gas
from certain high protein diets. Increased passage of gas is commonly
noticed after eating foods with high amounts of 
indigestible carbohydrates, like beans, lentils, dairy products,
onions, garlic, leeks, radishes, potatoes, oats, wheat, cauliflower,
broccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts. Humans lack the enzymes, so the bacteria able to ferment 
complex carbohydrates take over, and this naturally leads to more
gas than usual. But if you feel uncomfortable,
bloated or visibly distended, this may indicate impaired movement
of gas along the gastrointestinal track. It's important not to just 
blame certain foods for gas and bloating and then avoid them. You don't want to starve the bacteria
that digest these complex carbohydrates, or they'll have to start eating the sugars
in the mucus lining of your intestines. Your personal gas will vary

If I say, "Venice," do you imagine 
yourself gliding down the Grand Canal, serenaded by a gondolier? There's no doubt that the gondola 
is a symbol of Venice, Italy, but how did this curious banana-shaped
black boat get its distinctive look? The origins of the Venetian gondola 
are lost to history, but by the 1500s, some 10,000 gondolas
transported dignitaries, merchants and goods through the city's canals. In fact, Venice teemed with many types
of handmade boats, from utilitarian rafts to
the Doge's own ostentatious gilded barge. Like a modern day taxi system,
gondolas were leased to boatmen who made the rounds of the
city's ferry stations. Passengers paid a fare to be carried from
one side of the Grand Canal to the other, as well as to other points around the city. But gondoliers soon developed a bad rap. Historical documents describe numerous
infractions involving boatmen, including cursing, gambling,
extorting passengers -- even occasional acts of violence. To minimize the unpredictability
of canal travel, Venetian citizens who could afford it
purchased their own gondolas, just as a celebirty might use
a private car and driver today. These wealthy Venetians hired two private
gondoliers to ferry them around the city and maintain their boats. The gondolas soon became a status symbol,
much like an expensive car, with custom fittings, 
carved and gilded ornamentation, and seasonal fabrics, like silk and velvet. However, the majority of 
gondolas seen today are black because in 1562, 
Venetian authorities decreed that all but ceremonial gondolas 
be painted black in order to avoid 
sinfully extravagant displays. Apparently, Venetian authorities did not 
believe in "pimping their rides." Still, some wealthy Venetians 
chose to pay the fines in order to maintain their 
ornamental gondolas, a small price to keep up appearances. The distinctive look of the gondola 
developed over many centuries. Each gondola was constructed
in a family boatyard called a squero. From their fathers and grandfathers,
sons learned how to select and season pieces of beech, cherry, elm, fir, larch,
lime, mahogany, oak and walnut. The gondola makers began 
with a wooden template that may have been hammered into
the workshop floor generations earlier. From this basic form,
they attached fore and aft sterns, then formed the longitudinal planks
and ribs that made up the frame of a boat designed to glide through
shallow, narrow canals. A gondola has no straight lines or edges. Its familiar profile was achieved through
an impressive fire and water process that involved warping the boards with
torches made of marsh reeds set ablaze. However, the majority of the 500 hours
that went into building a gondola involved the final stages: preparing surfaces and applying successive 
coats of waterproof varnish. The varnish was a family recipe,
as closely guarded as one for risotto or a homemade sauce. Yet even with the woodwork finished,
the gondola was still not complete. Specialized artisans supplied their
gondola-making colleagues with elaborate covered 
passenger compartments, upholstery and ornaments 
of steel and brass. Oar makers became integral partners
to the gondola makers. The Venetian oarlock, or fórcola,
began as a simple wooden fork, but evolved into a high-precision tool
that allowed a gondolier to guide the oar into many positions. By the late 1800s, gondola makers began to make the left side
of the gondola wider than the right as a counter balance to 
the force created by a single gondolier. This modification allowed rowers to
steer from the right side only, and without lifting the oar from the water. While these modifications improved
gondola travel, they were not enough to
keep pace with motorized boats. Today, only about 400 gondolas
glide through the waterways of Venice, and each year, fewer authentic gondolas
are turned out by hand. But along the alleys, street signs 
contain words in Venetian dialect for the locations of old boatyards,
oar makers and ferry stations, imprinting the memory 
of the boat-building trades that once kept life in the most serene 
republic gliding along at a steady clip.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of the family boatyard where each gondola was constructed. The closest generated MCQ is not available, but Question 2 mentions the number of gondolas that transported dignitaries, merchants, and goods through Venice's canals by the 1500s, which is somewhat related to the construction of gondolas.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the construction of gondolas, I would choose Question 1, which mentions the fire and water process involved in warping the boards to achieve the gondola's familiar profile. This question is related to the construction of gondolas, but it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose a related question, it would be Question 1.

**Transcript**:
If I say, "Venice," do you imagine 
yourself gliding down the Grand Canal, serenaded by a gondolier? There's no doubt that the gondola 
is a symbol of Venice, Italy, but how did this curious banana-shaped
black boat get its distinctive look? The origins of the Venetian gondola 
are lost to history, but by the 1500s, some 10,000 gondolas
transported dignitaries, merchants and goods through the city's canals. In fact, Venice teemed with many types
of handmade boats, from utilitarian rafts to
the Doge's own ostentatious gilded barge. Like a modern day taxi system,
gondolas were leased to boatmen who made the rounds of the
city's ferry stations. Passengers paid a fare to be carried from
one side of the Grand Canal to the other, as well as to other points around the city. But gondoliers soon developed a bad rap. Historical documents describe numerous
infractions involving boatmen, including cursing, gambling,
extorting passengers -- even occasional acts of violence. To minimize the unpredictability
of canal travel, Venetian citizens who could afford it
purchased their own gondolas, just as a celebirty might use
a private car and driver today. These wealthy Venetians hired two private
gondoliers to ferry them around the city and maintain their boats. The gondolas soon became a status symbol,
much like an expensive car, with custom fittings, 
carved and gilded ornamentation, and seasonal fabrics, like silk and velvet. However, the majority of 
gondolas seen today are black because in 1562, 
Venetian authorities decreed that all but ceremonial gondolas 
be painted black in order to avoid 
sinfully extravagant displays. Apparently, Venetian authorities did not 
believe in "pimping their rides." Still, some wealthy Venetians 
chose to pay the fines in order to maintain their 
ornamental gondolas, a small price to keep up appearances. The distinctive look of the gondola 
developed over many centuries. Each gondola was constructed
in a family boatyard called a squero. From their fathers and grandfathers,
sons learned how to select and season pieces of beech, cherry, elm, fir, larch,
lime, mahogany, oak and walnut. The gondola makers began 
with a wooden template that may have been hammered into
the workshop floor generations earlier. From this basic form,
they attached fore and aft sterns, then formed the longitudinal planks
and ribs that made up the frame of a boat designed to glide through
shallow, narrow canals. A gondola has no straight lines or edges. Its familiar profile was achieved through
an impressive fire and water process that involved warping the boards with
torches made of marsh reeds set ablaze. However, the majority of the 500 hours
that went into building a gondola involved the final stages: preparing surfaces and applying successive 
coats of waterproof varnish. The varnish was a family recipe,
as closely guarded as one for risotto or a homemade sauce. Yet even with the woodwork finished,
the gondola was still not complete. Specialized artisans supplied their
gondola-making colleagues with elaborate covered 
passenger compartments, upholstery and ornaments 
of steel and brass. Oar makers became integral partners
to the gondola makers. The Venetian oarlock, or fórcola,
began as a simple wooden fork, but evolved into a high-precision tool
that allowed a gondolier to guide the oar into many positions. By the late 1800s, gondola makers began to make the left side
of the gondola wider than the right as a counter balance to 
the force created by a single gondolier. This modification allowed rowers to
steer from the right side only, and without lifting the oar from the water. While these modifications improved
gondola travel, they were not enough to
keep pace with motorized boats. Today, only about 400 gondolas
glide through the waterways of Venice, and each year, fewer authentic gondolas
are turned out by hand. But along the alleys, street signs 
contain words in Venetian dialect for the locations of old boatyards,
oar makers and ferry stations, imprinting the memory 
of the boat-building trades that once kept life in the most serene 
republic gliding along at a steady clip.

**Transcript**:
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. The Earth is spinning and we are spinning along with
it. But what if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning? 
Well, first of all, you would gain weight. But that would be the least of your worries. The spin of our planet is important and literally giving you the time of your life. At the equator, the surface of Earth, and everything on it, is spinning around at
465 meters per second. As you move closer to the poles you
don't have to move as quickly to complete Earths daily rotation. 
Here in San Francisco, the Earth is driving me east at 368 meters per second. 
If I could float above the surface independent of the Earth's rotation, the
Earth would spin underneath me this quickly. Pretty cool. But, of course,
when I jump straight up into the air, the Earth doesn't move underneath me
because I continued to spin with it. We are all spinning with the Earth and
that is why slamming on a set of magical planetary breaks that caused
everything classically called earth to stop
spinning would be catastrophic. Immediately everything that wasn't Earth, and wasn't safely at the poles,
would continue moving, as it had been, and be flung due east at more than a
thousand miles an hour. You wouldn't be flung into space because
escape velocity is 24,800 mph but your body would instantly become a 9.5 inch caliber bullet. Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed. Because the atmosphere would more
gradually slow down, people in airplanes, assuming they could navigate the
resulting storms, might have a better chance of surviving. Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better. But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them down on the ground. Runways would just be entrances to the new planet-sized graveyard, created by the no longer spinning Earth. People really really near the poles
might be okay but only at first. Gusts of wind, as fast as
those near an atomic bomb detonation, would blast, pass the surface and up into the
sky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude. The friction alone, caused by the now stopped Earth colliding
with these winds, would be enough to cause massive fires, unparalleled erosion and damage to
anything strong enough to stay put after the initial braking. The Sun would
seem to freeze in the sky as days became not 24 hours long but 365 days long. Without spinning innards, Earth's
protective magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly
amounts of ionising radiation from the Sun. The oceans would surge onto land in
tsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearly all dry land, before migrating to the poles, where gravity is stronger, no longer held to
the ocean basins by the inertia Earth's spin gave them, until Earth itself, no longer bulging an extra 42
kilometers around its equator, because of its rotation slowly compressed into a more perfect sphere than it is now. Possibly allowing the
oceans to eventually return somewhat. That is what would occur if it actually happened.
It won't actually happen but woah, its rotation is slowing down. More on that later. First, if the Earth
really is spinning so quickly, why can't we feel it? Why doesn't the Earth's rotation make us dizzy? Well, lucky for us, the change in velocity is just too
gradual. The Earth is too huge. It's like driving in a car that takes 6 hours and six thousand miles to make
one left turn. It's not sudden enough to
register with our senses. But that change in velocity is real and it makes us way less, because of inertia. On our spinning
planet your velocity is constantly changing but always tangential to the circular path you were
being dragged along. Now, because inertia is a property of
matter, which includes your body, without a force acting upon us we would slowly leave the surface of Earth. Luckily, the Earth is exerting a force on us.
A center-seeking, centripetal force, delivered by gravity. The centripetal force required to keep
you along a circular path with Earth is subtracted from Earth's total gravitational pull on you. The remaining force simply pushes you down, toward the centre of the Earth - it gives you weight. At the equator, if the Earth didn't spin,
and no centripetal force was required to keep you with the Earth, you would weigh 0.3 percent more than you currently do. If Earth spun you around 17 times faster than it currently does,
all of its gravitational force would go toward centripetal force
fighting against your inertia and you would be weightless. So here's a diet idea. Hope that the Earth starts spinning faster and go back for guilt-free seconds. Seconds. We know exactly how long a second is. The outermost electron of an atom of cesium 133 is alone. When the atom is undisturbed, only the nucleus interacts with this outermost electron, tickling it regularly and rapidly between two levels. After 9,192,631,770 oscillations between those two levels,
one second has passed. Exactly. That is literally the definition of a second. We can measure and count those oscillations. It's how atomic clocks work. Making atomic clocks, the most accurate measurement device
ever built by humans, to measure anything. We can't define a second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day because of Earth's spin. It's too irregular. Little changes in the distribution of mass on Earth,
caused by earthquakes or melting ice or man-made dams or technically even you walking up stairs or downstairs, cause Earth's rotational speed to change. Like a figure skater moving their arms
further away from or closer to their bodies. Now add on top of that the fact that tides, caused by the Moon, drag against Earth's rotation and you
wind up with an unstable rotation speed that is predominately slowing down. Now, these changes are incredibly incredibly
slight, but over time they add up. In 140 million years, a day on earth will not be 24 hours long, it will be 25. That might not sound like much but in order to do important things, like
deliver accurate GPS information, we need a more accurate timekeeping device than that. So, as a solution scientists keep the pace of seconds
using atomic clocks, TAI time. And other scientists measure the changing speed of Earth's
rotation by observing distant stars and quasars. Now, every few months they
find out just how behind or ahead Earth is running, and if it's getting too
close to being a second off, they decide to add or subtract the
second from the current year. The result is the time used almost everywhere, including your phone: UTC. Since this system began in 1972 25 leap seconds have been added. What this means is that clock time is, and has to be, a manufactured product with upgrades and tune ups administered periodically, after defects are noticed. The time we give to now and the future is only ever approximate. That's weird but it's also entirely not weird. As Demetrios Matsakis, the Chief
Scientist of Time Services for the US Naval Observatory puts it, "we save lives and we end lives. We add time and we
can take time away, but in both cases we do so
without completely understanding exactly what life is, or what time is." Regardless, thank you for spending some
of yours with me... and as always, thanks for watching.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a way to identify a similar question.

The ground truth MCQ is about the speed of the Earth's spin at the equator. None of the generated MCQs address this topic. However, if I had to choose a question that is vaguely related to the topic of the Earth's properties, I would choose Question 8, which is about atmospheric pressure and the weight of the air in the atmosphere. This question is still not similar to the ground truth MCQ, but it is the closest in terms of topic.

If I had to provide an index, I would say Question 8 is the most similar, but I want to emphasize that it is still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically designed to match the ground truth MCQ. This would involve creating questions that are about the speed of the Earth's spin at the equator, with options that are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Here is an example of a generated MCQ that is similar to the ground truth MCQ:

Question: What is the speed of the Earth's spin at the equator?
Options: A. 400 meters per second, B. 465 meters per second, C. 500 meters per second, D. 600 meters per second

This question is a much better match to the ground truth MCQ, and it would be a good candidate for evaluation.

ever built by humans, to measure anything. We can't define a second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day because of Earth's spin. It's too irregular. Little changes in the distribution of mass on Earth,
caused by earthquakes or melting ice or man-made dams or technically even you walking up stairs or downstairs, cause Earth's rotational speed to change. Like a figure skater moving their arms
further away from or closer to their bodies. Now add on top of that the fact that tides, caused by the Moon, drag against Earth's rotation and you
wind up with an unstable rotation speed that is predominately slowing down. Now, these changes are incredibly incredibly
slight, but over time they add up. In 140 million years, a day on earth will not be 24 hours long, it will be 25. That might not sound like much but in order to do important things, like
deliver accurate GPS information, we need a more accurate timekeeping device than that. So, as a solution scientists keep the pace of seconds
using atomic clocks, TAI time. And other scientists measure the changing speed of Earth's
rotation by observing distant stars and quasars. Now, every few months they
find out just how behind or ahead Earth is running, and if it's getting too
close to being a second off, they decide to add or subtract the
second from the current year. The result is the time used almost everywhere, including your phone: UTC. Since this system began in 1972 25 leap seconds have been added. What this means is that clock time is, and has to be, a manufactured product with upgrades and tune ups administered periodically, after defects are noticed. The time we give to now and the future is only ever approximate. That's weird but it's also entirely not weird. As Demetrios Matsakis, the Chief
Scientist of Time Services for the US Naval Observatory puts it, "we save lives and we end lives. We add time and we
can take time away, but in both cases we do so
without completely understanding exactly what life is, or what time is." Regardless, thank you for spending some

**Transcript**:
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. The Earth is spinning and we are spinning along with
it. But what if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning? 
Well, first of all, you would gain weight. But that would be the least of your worries. The spin of our planet is important and literally giving you the time of your life. At the equator, the surface of Earth, and everything on it, is spinning around at
465 meters per second. As you move closer to the poles you
don't have to move as quickly to complete Earths daily rotation. 
Here in San Francisco, the Earth is driving me east at 368 meters per second. 
If I could float above the surface independent of the Earth's rotation, the
Earth would spin underneath me this quickly. Pretty cool. But, of course,
when I jump straight up into the air, the Earth doesn't move underneath me
because I continued to spin with it. We are all spinning with the Earth and
that is why slamming on a set of magical planetary breaks that caused
everything classically called earth to stop
spinning would be catastrophic. Immediately everything that wasn't Earth, and wasn't safely at the poles,
would continue moving, as it had been, and be flung due east at more than a
thousand miles an hour. You wouldn't be flung into space because
escape velocity is 24,800 mph but your body would instantly become a 9.5 inch caliber bullet. Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed. Because the atmosphere would more
gradually slow down, people in airplanes, assuming they could navigate the
resulting storms, might have a better chance of surviving. Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better. But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them down on the ground. Runways would just be entrances to the new planet-sized graveyard, created by the no longer spinning Earth. People really really near the poles
might be okay but only at first. Gusts of wind, as fast as
those near an atomic bomb detonation, would blast, pass the surface and up into the
sky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude. The friction alone, caused by the now stopped Earth colliding
with these winds, would be enough to cause massive fires, unparalleled erosion and damage to
anything strong enough to stay put after the initial braking. The Sun would
seem to freeze in the sky as days became not 24 hours long but 365 days long. Without spinning innards, Earth's
protective magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly
amounts of ionising radiation from the Sun. The oceans would surge onto land in
tsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearly all dry land, before migrating to the poles, where gravity is stronger, no longer held to
the ocean basins by the inertia Earth's spin gave them, until Earth itself, no longer bulging an extra 42
kilometers around its equator, because of its rotation slowly compressed into a more perfect sphere than it is now. Possibly allowing the
oceans to eventually return somewhat. That is what would occur if it actually happened.
It won't actually happen but woah, its rotation is slowing down. More on that later. First, if the Earth
really is spinning so quickly, why can't we feel it? Why doesn't the Earth's rotation make us dizzy? Well, lucky for us, the change in velocity is just too
gradual. The Earth is too huge. It's like driving in a car that takes 6 hours and six thousand miles to make
one left turn. It's not sudden enough to
register with our senses. But that change in velocity is real and it makes us way less, because of inertia. On our spinning
planet your velocity is constantly changing but always tangential to the circular path you were
being dragged along. Now, because inertia is a property of
matter, which includes your body, without a force acting upon us we would slowly leave the surface of Earth. Luckily, the Earth is exerting a force on us.
A center-seeking, centripetal force, delivered by gravity. The centripetal force required to keep
you along a circular path with Earth is subtracted from Earth's total gravitational pull on you. The remaining force simply pushes you down, toward the centre of the Earth - it gives you weight. At the equator, if the Earth didn't spin,
and no centripetal force was required to keep you with the Earth, you would weigh 0.3 percent more than you currently do. If Earth spun you around 17 times faster than it currently does,
all of its gravitational force would go toward centripetal force
fighting against your inertia and you would be weightless. So here's a diet idea. Hope that the Earth starts spinning faster and go back for guilt-free seconds. Seconds. We know exactly how long a second is. The outermost electron of an atom of cesium 133 is alone. When the atom is undisturbed, only the nucleus interacts with this outermost electron, tickling it regularly and rapidly between two levels. After 9,192,631,770 oscillations between those two levels,
one second has passed. Exactly. That is literally the definition of a second. We can measure and count those oscillations. It's how atomic clocks work. Making atomic clocks, the most accurate measurement device
ever built by humans, to measure anything. We can't define a second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day because of Earth's spin. It's too irregular. Little changes in the distribution of mass on Earth,

**Transcript**:
On September 1st, 1953, William Scoville used a hand crank
and a cheap drill saw to bore into a young man's skull,
cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube. But this wasn't a scene from a horror film
or a gruesome police report. Dr. Scoville was one of the most 
renowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the young man was Henry Molaison,
the famous patient known as "H.M.", whose case provided amazing insights
into how our brains work. As a boy, Henry had cracked 
his skull in an accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out
and losing control of bodily functions. After enduring years of frequent episodes,
and even dropping out of high school, the desperate young man 
had turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky surgeries. Partial lobotomies had been used
for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that
mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas. Having successfully used them
to reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove 
H.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system
that was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown. At first glance, 
the operation had succeeded. H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared,
with no change in personality, and his IQ even improved. But there was one problem: 
His memory was shot. Besides losing most of his memories
from the previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones,
forgetting what day it was, repeating comments,
and even eating multiple meals in a row. When Scoville informed another expert,
Wilder Penfield, of the results, he sent a Ph.D student named Brenda Milner
to study H.M. at his parents' home, where he now spent his days
doing odd chores, and watching classic movies
for the first time, over and over. What she discovered through
a series of tests and interviews didn't just contribute greatly
to the study of memory. It redefined what memory even meant. One of Milner's findings shed light
on the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form new memories,
he still retained information long enough from moment to moment
to finish a sentence or find the bathroom. When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to remember it 
for fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly. But only five minutes later,
he forgot the test had even taken place. Neuroscientists had though of memory
as monolithic, all of it essentially the same
and stored throughout the brain. Milner's results were not only the first
clue for the now familiar distinction between short-term and long-term memory, but show that each uses 
different brain regions. We now know that memory formation
involves several steps. After immediate sensory data is temporarily
transcribed by neurons in the cortex, it travels to the hippocampus, where special proteins work to strengthen 
the cortical synaptic connections. If the experience was strong enough, or we recall it periodically
in the first few days, the hippocampus then transfers the memory
back to the cortex for permanent storage. H.M.'s mind could form
the initial impressions, but without a hippocampus
to perform this memory consolidation, they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand. But this was not the 
only memory distinction Milner found. In a now famous experiment,
she asked H.M. to trace a third star in the narrow space between 
the outlines of two concentric ones while he could only see
his paper and pencil through a mirror. Like anyone else performing such 
an awkward task for the first time, he did horribly. But surprisingly, he improved over 
repeated trials, even though he had no memory
of previous attempts. His unconscious motor centers remembered
what the conscious mind had forgotten. What Milner had discovered was that the
declarative memory of names, dates and facts is different from the procedural memory
of riding a bicycle or signing your name. And we now know that procedural memory relies more on the basal ganglia 
and cerebellum, structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain. This distinction between "knowing that"
and "knowing how" has underpinned all memory research since. H.M. died at the age of 82 after
a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home. Over the years, he had been examined
by more than 100 neuroscientists, making his the most 
studied mind in history. Upon his death, his brain was
preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000
individual slices and photographed to form a digital map
down to the level of individual neurons, all in a live broadcast
watched by 400,000 people. Though H.M. spent most of his life
forgetting things, he and his contributions
to our understanding of memory will be remembered for 
generations to come.

**Transcript**:
On September 1st, 1953, William Scoville used a hand crank
and a cheap drill saw to bore into a young man's skull,
cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube. But this wasn't a scene from a horror film
or a gruesome police report. Dr. Scoville was one of the most 
renowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the young man was Henry Molaison,
the famous patient known as "H.M.", whose case provided amazing insights
into how our brains work. As a boy, Henry had cracked 
his skull in an accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out
and losing control of bodily functions. After enduring years of frequent episodes,
and even dropping out of high school, the desperate young man 
had turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky surgeries. Partial lobotomies had been used
for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that
mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas. Having successfully used them
to reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove 
H.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system
that was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown. At first glance, 
the operation had succeeded. H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared,
with no change in personality, and his IQ even improved. But there was one problem: 
His memory was shot. Besides losing most of his memories
from the previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones,
forgetting what day it was, repeating comments,
and even eating multiple meals in a row. When Scoville informed another expert,
Wilder Penfield, of the results, he sent a Ph.D student named Brenda Milner
to study H.M. at his parents' home, where he now spent his days
doing odd chores, and watching classic movies
for the first time, over and over. What she discovered through
a series of tests and interviews didn't just contribute greatly
to the study of memory. It redefined what memory even meant. One of Milner's findings shed light
on the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form new memories,
he still retained information long enough from moment to moment
to finish a sentence or find the bathroom. When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to remember it 
for fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly. But only five minutes later,
he forgot the test had even taken place. Neuroscientists had though of memory
as monolithic, all of it essentially the same
and stored throughout the brain. Milner's results were not only the first
clue for the now familiar distinction between short-term and long-term memory, but show that each uses 
different brain regions. We now know that memory formation
involves several steps. After immediate sensory data is temporarily
transcribed by neurons in the cortex, it travels to the hippocampus, where special proteins work to strengthen 
the cortical synaptic connections. If the experience was strong enough, or we recall it periodically
in the first few days, the hippocampus then transfers the memory
back to the cortex for permanent storage. H.M.'s mind could form
the initial impressions, but without a hippocampus
to perform this memory consolidation, they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand. But this was not the 
only memory distinction Milner found. In a now famous experiment,
she asked H.M. to trace a third star in the narrow space between 
the outlines of two concentric ones while he could only see
his paper and pencil through a mirror. Like anyone else performing such 
an awkward task for the first time, he did horribly. But surprisingly, he improved over 
repeated trials, even though he had no memory
of previous attempts. His unconscious motor centers remembered
what the conscious mind had forgotten. What Milner had discovered was that the
declarative memory of names, dates and facts is different from the procedural memory
of riding a bicycle or signing your name. And we now know that procedural memory relies more on the basal ganglia 
and cerebellum, structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain. This distinction between "knowing that"
and "knowing how" has underpinned all memory research since. H.M. died at the age of 82 after
a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home. Over the years, he had been examined
by more than 100 neuroscientists, making his the most 
studied mind in history. Upon his death, his brain was
preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000
individual slices and photographed to form a digital map
down to the level of individual neurons, all in a live broadcast
watched by 400,000 people. Though H.M. spent most of his life
forgetting things, he and his contributions
to our understanding of memory will be remembered for 
generations to come.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically feedback loops and ecosystems, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the story of H.M. and his brain surgery.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 1 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate answer would be that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of H.M.'s story should be provided.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: None (or 1, if we consider only the format and structure of the question)

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not match the ground truth MCQ because they appear to be related to a different topic, specifically feedback loops and ecosystems, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to memory and neuroscience.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but only in terms of format, not content. However, this is a very weak match, and I would not recommend using any of the generated MCQs as a substitute for the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of generated MCQs that are specifically related to memory and neuroscience would be needed to find a suitable match.

Index: No match found.

On September 1st, 1953, William Scoville used a hand crank

cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube. But this wasn't a scene from a horror film
or a gruesome police report. Dr. Scoville was one of the most 
renowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the young man was Henry Molaison,
the famous patient known as "H.M.", whose case provided amazing insights

his skull in an accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out
and losing control of bodily functions. After enduring years of frequent episodes,
and even dropping out of high school, the desperate young man 
had turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky surgeries. Partial lobotomies had been used
for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that
mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas. Having successfully used them
to reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove 
H.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system
that was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown. At first glance, 
the operation had succeeded. H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared,
with no change in personality, and his IQ even improved. But there was one problem: 
His memory was shot. Besides losing most of his memories
from the previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones,
forgetting what day it was, repeating comments,

doing odd chores, and watching classic movies
for the first time, over and over. What she discovered through
a series of tests and interviews didn't just contribute greatly
to the study of memory. It redefined what memory even meant. One of Milner's findings shed light
on the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form new memories,
he still retained information long enough from moment to moment
to finish a sentence or find the bathroom. When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to remember it 
for fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly. But only five minutes later,
he forgot the test had even taken place. Neuroscientists had though of memory
as monolithic, all of it essentially the same

back to the cortex for permanent storage. H.M.'s mind could form
the initial impressions, but without a hippocampus
to perform this memory consolidation, they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand. But this was not the 
only memory distinction Milner found. In a now famous experiment,
she asked H.M. to trace a third star in the narrow space between 
the outlines of two concentric ones while he could only see
his paper and pencil through a mirror. Like anyone else performing such 
an awkward task for the first time, he did horribly. But surprisingly, he improved over

**Transcript**:
Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop. And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things that build resilience by governing 
the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful, like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides. Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems
play together, creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to quantum mechanics, whereas the ground truth MCQ and the transcript are related to feedback loops in ecosystems.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the concept of change in a system, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar. But if I had to choose, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, but only because it talks about a change in the governing laws of a system, which is vaguely related to the concept of change in a feedback loop.

So, my answer would be: None, but if I had to choose, I would say Question 9, with the caveat that it's not actually similar.

**Transcript**:
Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop. And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things that build resilience by governing 
the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful, like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides. Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems
play together, creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra.

**Transcript**:
Consider throwing a ball
straight into the air. Can you predict the motion
of the ball after it leaves your hand? Sure, that's easy. The ball will move upward
until it gets to some highest point, then it will come back down
and land in your hand again. Of course, that's what happens, and you know this because you have
witnessed events like this countless times. You've been observing the physics
of everyday phenomena your entire life. But suppose we explore a question
about the physics of atoms, like what does the motion of an electron around the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom look like? Could we answer that question based on
our experience with everyday physics? Definietly not. Why? Because the physics that governs the
behavior of systems at such small scales is much different than the physics
of the macroscopic objects you see around you all the time. The everyday world you know and love behaves according to the laws 
of classical mechanics. But systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws 
of quantum mechanics. This quantum world turns out to be
a very strange place. An illustration of quantum strangeness
is given by a famous thought experiment: Schrödinger's cat. A physicist, who doesn't particularly 
like cats, puts a cat in a box, along with a bomb that has a 50% chance
of blowing up after the lid is closed. Until we reopen the lid,
there is no way of knowing whether the bomb exploded or not, and thus, no way of knowing
if the cat is alive or dead. In quantum physics,
we could say that before our observation the cat was in a superposition state. It was neither alive nor dead but
rather in a mixture of both possibilities, with a 50% chance for each. The same sort of thing happens
to physical systems at quantum scales, like an electron orbiting
in a hydrogen atom. The electron isn't really orbiting at all. It's sort of everywhere in space,
all at once, with more of a probability of being
at some places than others, and it's only after 
we measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is
at that moment. A lot like how we didn't know
whether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box. This brings us to the strange
and beautiful phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,
we have two cats in two different boxes. If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment
with this pair of cats, the outcome of the experiment
can be one of four possibilities. Either both cats will be alive,
or both will be dead, or one will be alive 
and the other dead, or vice versa. The system of both cats
is again in a superposition state, with each outcome having a 25% chance
rather than 50%. But here's the cool thing: quantum mechanics tells us
it's possible to erase the both cats alive and both cats dead
outcomes from the superposition state. In other words,
there can be a two cat system, such that the outcome will always be
one cat alive and the other cat dead. The technical term for this is that the
states of the cats are entangled. But there's something truly mindblowing
about quantum entanglement. If you prepare the system of two cats
in boxes in this entangled state, then move the boxes to opposite 
ends of the universe, the outcome of the experiment
will still always be the same. One cat will always come out alive,
and the other cat will always end up dead, even though which particular cat
lives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome. How is this possible? How is it that the states of cats
on opposite sides of the universe can be entangled in this way? They're too far away to communicate
with each other in time, so how do the two bombs always 
conspire such that one blows up and the other doesn't? You might be thinking, "This is just some theoretical
mumbo jumbo. This sort of thing can't happen
in the real world." But it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed in 
real world lab experiments. Two subatomic particles entangled
in a superposition state, where if one spins one way
then the other must spin the other way, will do just that,
even when there's no way for information to pass
from one particle to the other indicating which way to spin
to obey the rules of entanglement. It's not surprising then that
entanglement is at the core of quantum information science, a growing field studying how to use
the laws of the strange quantum world in our macroscopic world, like in quantum cryptography, so spies
can send secure messages to each other, or quantum computing,
for cracking secret codes. Everyday physics may start to look
a bit more like the strange quantum world. Quantum teleportation 
may even progress so far, that one day your cat will 
escape to a safer galaxy, where there are no physicists
and no boxes.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the Monty Hall problem, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the behavior of systems on atomic scales.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say Question 8 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's not similar in terms of content or intent.

So, I would say the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None, or if you want me to choose one: 8 (but keep in mind that it's not similar in terms of content or intent).

It would be better to generate new MCQs that are related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which is the behavior of systems on atomic scales and quantum mechanics.

**Transcript**:
Consider throwing a ball
straight into the air. Can you predict the motion
of the ball after it leaves your hand? Sure, that's easy. The ball will move upward
until it gets to some highest point, then it will come back down
and land in your hand again. Of course, that's what happens, and you know this because you have
witnessed events like this countless times. You've been observing the physics
of everyday phenomena your entire life. But suppose we explore a question
about the physics of atoms, like what does the motion of an electron around the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom look like? Could we answer that question based on
our experience with everyday physics? Definietly not. Why? Because the physics that governs the
behavior of systems at such small scales is much different than the physics
of the macroscopic objects you see around you all the time. The everyday world you know and love behaves according to the laws 
of classical mechanics. But systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws 
of quantum mechanics. This quantum world turns out to be
a very strange place. An illustration of quantum strangeness
is given by a famous thought experiment: Schrödinger's cat. A physicist, who doesn't particularly 
like cats, puts a cat in a box, along with a bomb that has a 50% chance
of blowing up after the lid is closed. Until we reopen the lid,
there is no way of knowing whether the bomb exploded or not, and thus, no way of knowing
if the cat is alive or dead. In quantum physics,
we could say that before our observation the cat was in a superposition state. It was neither alive nor dead but
rather in a mixture of both possibilities, with a 50% chance for each. The same sort of thing happens
to physical systems at quantum scales, like an electron orbiting
in a hydrogen atom. The electron isn't really orbiting at all. It's sort of everywhere in space,
all at once, with more of a probability of being
at some places than others, and it's only after 
we measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is
at that moment. A lot like how we didn't know
whether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box. This brings us to the strange
and beautiful phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,
we have two cats in two different boxes. If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment
with this pair of cats, the outcome of the experiment
can be one of four possibilities. Either both cats will be alive,
or both will be dead, or one will be alive 
and the other dead, or vice versa. The system of both cats
is again in a superposition state, with each outcome having a 25% chance
rather than 50%. But here's the cool thing: quantum mechanics tells us
it's possible to erase the both cats alive and both cats dead
outcomes from the superposition state. In other words,
there can be a two cat system, such that the outcome will always be
one cat alive and the other cat dead. The technical term for this is that the
states of the cats are entangled. But there's something truly mindblowing
about quantum entanglement. If you prepare the system of two cats
in boxes in this entangled state, then move the boxes to opposite 
ends of the universe, the outcome of the experiment
will still always be the same. One cat will always come out alive,
and the other cat will always end up dead, even though which particular cat
lives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome. How is this possible? How is it that the states of cats
on opposite sides of the universe can be entangled in this way? They're too far away to communicate
with each other in time, so how do the two bombs always 
conspire such that one blows up and the other doesn't? You might be thinking, "This is just some theoretical
mumbo jumbo. This sort of thing can't happen
in the real world." But it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed in 
real world lab experiments. Two subatomic particles entangled
in a superposition state, where if one spins one way
then the other must spin the other way, will do just that,
even when there's no way for information to pass
from one particle to the other indicating which way to spin
to obey the rules of entanglement. It's not surprising then that
entanglement is at the core of quantum information science, a growing field studying how to use
the laws of the strange quantum world in our macroscopic world, like in quantum cryptography, so spies
can send secure messages to each other, or quantum computing,
for cracking secret codes. Everyday physics may start to look
a bit more like the strange quantum world. Quantum teleportation 
may even progress so far, that one day your cat will 
escape to a safer galaxy, where there are no physicists
and no boxes.

Well 'Let's Make a Deal' was a popular show back in the day; contestants could go on this game show and maybe go home with the car of their dreams. First of all the game show host was a very famous guy named Monty Hall. And Monty would come on to the show and he would have three doors. And a contestant, that's you, would come on to the show, Monty would give you the chance to choose door number 1, door number 2 or door number 3. Now behind one of those doors, only one, was your dream flash car. Bright red, sports car, very fast; it was awesome. And behind the other two doors were 'zonks', that was the 
'Let's Make a Deal' word for something that you don't really want. So you had- looks like a 1 in 3 chance of getting your dream car. So suppose you pick door number 1; and Monty would then do the same thing every week. He would go over to the two doors you didn't pick, 2 and 3, and he would open one of them. Let's suppose he opened door number 2. And the door that Monty opened would always have behind it a zonk. 
- (So- so he knew?) Well he knows everything right? He's the game show host. And then Monty looked at you in the face and say, 'do you like door number 1 or do you want to switch?' There's only one thing to switch to, in this case it's door number 3. Are you gonna stay with your choice, or are you gonna make that leap to something different? And very often contestants would stand there agonised, right? So they've got some new information- 
- (So stick or switch?) Stick or switch. Well, a remarkable thing about this problem, simple as it is, is that it has sparked just endless debate. In the time of the show I don't recall anybody ever saying there was a dedicated strategy that you should always follow, but in fact there is a dedicated strategy should follow: you should pick door number 3. That's the answer, you should switch. You should switch every time and that will do the best for you over the long run. So there is a 1/3 chance that the car is behind the door you picked initially, that means there must be a 2/3 chance, much greater twice as big, that the car is somewhere else. And since we know that somewhere else cannot be door number 2, because Monty showed us that, it's got to be over here. So this is what you should choose, you should switch. Twice as likely to have the car behind the door that you didn't pick as the door that you did. 2/3 probability to a 1/3 probability. Now if you switch are you guaranteed to win? Absolutely not. But if you play this game over and over again, on average, you will win 2/3 of the time so switch is your strategy and you can't beat it. One thing that you might say is that the initial 2/3 chance that the car was behind door number 2 and door number 3 got concentrated behind the door that Monty did not open. That's effectively what's happening, that's intuitively what's happening, and that in fact is what the mathematics shows is happening. Now there is a way to see that in kind of a more grand way; if we imagine not having three doors but we imagine having a hundred doors. And let's imagine that we're playing the same kind of game, we have Monty over here, he is going to give you an opportunity to pick a door and your dream flash car is behind one of these hundred doors but there are 99 zonks all behind the other doors. Now what is it that you're going to do? Well you're going to pick a door, say again you pick door number 1. Now you're feeling a little bit different than you might have felt in the case where there were three doors; because there you thought, wow I've got a 1 in 3 chance. Here you're thinking I've got a 1 in 100 chance,
I'm not gonna get that car. It's not behind door number 1, it's probably behind one of the other 99 doors. What Monty does is he opens 98 of those 99 doors, he shows you 98 zonks and he asked you now, do you want to switch? Well maybe just because of the sheer numbers this thing is a little clearer. You know that there was 99 out of a 100 chance that the car was over here and now the only door you're left with after Monty shows you all those zonks 
is door, say, number 37. And you're thinking, this is no good, this is no good, all those doors are no good; do I want to stay with 1 or do I want to stay with 37? You can sort of almost feel the concentration of that 99 percent going behind door number 37 and so you switch over here and very likely you're gonna get that car and drive away. (I like your car drawing.) Well thank you! (That makes more sense doesn't it? 
Suddenly it) (seems like a no-brainer.)
- It does seem like a no-brainer but in fact when it's on a smaller scale, maybe just because 1/3 and 2/3 are a whole lot closer to each other than 1 in 100 and 99 in a 100, that the the point is is obscured. [Preview] X and Y is the probability
of X given that Y happens, given that you know you open door number 2, what's the probability of the cars there, times the probability of Y happening by itself.

**Transcript**:
Imagine if half the people
in your neighborhood, your city, or even your whole country were wiped out. It might sound like something
out of an apocalyptic horror film, but it actually happened 
in the 14th century during a disease outbreak
known as the Black Death. Spreading from China through Asia,
the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, the devastating epidemic destroyed 
as much as 1/5 of the world's population, killing nearly 50% of Europeans
in just four years. One of the most fascinating
and puzzling things abut the Black Death is that the illness itself
was not a new phenomenon but one that has affected
humans for centuries. DNA analysis of bone
and tooth samples from this period, as well as an earlier epidemic known
as the Plague of Justinian in 541 CE, has revealed that both were caused
by Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium that causes
bubonic plague today. What this means is that the same disease
caused by the same pathogen can behave and spread 
very differently throughout history. Even before the use of antibiotics,
the deadliest oubreaks in modern times, such as the ones that occurred
in early 20th century India, killed no more than 3% of the population. Modern instances of plague
also tend to remain localized, or travel slowly,
as they are spread by rodent fleas. But the medieval Black Death,
which spread like wildfire, was most likely communicated directly
from one person to another. And because genetic comparisons of ancient
to modern strains of Yersinia pestis have not revealed any significantly
functional genetic differences, the key to why the earlier outbreak
was so much deadlier must lie not in the parasite but the host. For about 300 years during
the High Middle Ages, a warmer climate
and agricultural improvements had led to explosive population growth
throughout Europe. But with so many new mouths to feed, the end of this warm period
spelled disaster. High fertility rates
combined with reduced harvest, meant the land could no longer 
support its population, while the abundant supply of labor
kept wages low. As a result, most Europeans
in the early 14th century experienced a steady decline
in living standards, marked by famine, poverty and poor health,
leaving them vulnerable to infection. And indeed, the skeletal remains
of Black Death victims found in London show telltale signs of 
malnutrition and prior illness. The destruction caused by the Black Death
changed humanity in two important ways. On a societal level,
the rapid loss of population led to important changes
in Europe’s economic conditions. With more food to go around, as well as more land and better pay
for the surviving farmers and workers, people began to eat better and live longer as studies of London cemeteries
have shown. Higher living standards also brought
an increase in social mobility, weakening feudalism and eventually
leading to political reforms. But the plague also had an important
biological impact. The sudden death of so many of
the most frail and vulnerable people left behind a population with
a significantly different gene pool, including genes that may have helped
survivors resist the disease. And because such mutations 
often confer immunities to multiple pathogens 
that work in similar ways, research to discover the genetic
consequences of the Black Death has the potential to be hugely beneficial. Today, the threat of an epidemic 
on the scale of the Black Death has been largely eliminated 
thanks to antibiotics. But the bubonic plague continues to kill a
few thousand people worldwide every year, and the recent emergence
of a drug-resistant strain threatens the return of darker times. Learning more about the causes and effects
of the Black Death is important, not just for understanding how
our world has been shaped by the past. It may also help save us from 
a similar nightmare in the future.

in just four years. One of the most fascinating
and puzzling things abut the Black Death is that the illness itself
was not a new phenomenon but one that has affected
humans for centuries. DNA analysis of bone
and tooth samples from this period, as well as an earlier epidemic known
as the Plague of Justinian in 541 CE, has revealed that both were caused
by Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium that causes
bubonic plague today. What this means is that the same disease
caused by the same pathogen can behave and spread 
very differently throughout history. Even before the use of antibiotics,
the deadliest oubreaks in modern times, such as the ones that occurred
in early 20th century India, killed no more than 3% of the population. Modern instances of plague
also tend to remain localized, or travel slowly,
as they are spread by rodent fleas. But the medieval Black Death,
which spread like wildfire, was most likely communicated directly
from one person to another. And because genetic comparisons of ancient
to modern strains of Yersinia pestis have not revealed any significantly
functional genetic differences, the key to why the earlier outbreak
was so much deadlier must lie not in the parasite but the host. For about 300 years during
the High Middle Ages, a warmer climate
and agricultural improvements had led to explosive population growth
throughout Europe. But with so many new mouths to feed, the end of this warm period
spelled disaster. High fertility rates
combined with reduced harvest, meant the land could no longer 
support its population, while the abundant supply of labor
kept wages low. As a result, most Europeans
in the early 14th century experienced a steady decline
in living standards, marked by famine, poverty and poor health,
leaving them vulnerable to infection. And indeed, the skeletal remains
of Black Death victims found in London show telltale signs of 
malnutrition and prior illness. The destruction caused by the Black Death
changed humanity in two important ways. On a societal level,
the rapid loss of population led to important changes
in Europe’s economic conditions. With more food to go around, as well as more land and better pay
for the surviving farmers and workers, people began to eat better and live longer as studies of London cemeteries
have shown. Higher living standards also brought
an increase in social mobility, weakening feudalism and eventually
leading to political reforms. But the plague also had an important
biological impact. The sudden death of so many of
the most frail and vulnerable people left behind a population with
a significantly different gene pool, including genes that may have helped
survivors resist the disease. And because such mutations 
often confer immunities to multiple pathogens 
that work in similar ways, research to discover the genetic
consequences of the Black Death has the potential to be hugely beneficial. Today, the threat of an epidemic 
on the scale of the Black Death has been largely eliminated 
thanks to antibiotics. But the bubonic plague continues to kill a
few thousand people worldwide every year, and the recent emergence
of a drug-resistant strain threatens the return of darker times. Learning more about the causes and effects
of the Black Death is important, not just for understanding how
our world has been shaped by the past. It may also help save us from

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically visual perception and the brain's visual system.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say Question 1 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's not similar in terms of content.

It would be best to generate new MCQs that are specific to the topic of the Black Death and the transcript provided. 

In this case, I will provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ as: 1

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 19, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Check this out: Here's a grid, nothing special,
just a basic grid, very grid-y. But look closer, 
into this white spot at the center where the two central vertical
and horizontal lines intersect. Look very closely.
Notice anything funny about this spot? Yeah, nothing. But keep looking.
Get weird and stare at it. Now, keeping your gaze
fixed on this white spot, check what's happening
in your peripheral vision. The other spots, are they still white?
Or do they show weird flashes of grey? Now look at this pan for baking muffins. Oh, sorry, one of the cups is inverted.
It pops up instead of dipping down. Wait, no spin the pan.
The other five are domed now? Whichever it is, this pan's defective. Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln,
and here's one upside down. Nothing weird going on here. Wait, turn that upside down one right side up.
What have they done to Abe? Those are just three optical illusions,
images that seem to trick us. How do they work? Are magical things happening
in the images themselves? While we could certainly be
sneaking flashes of grey into the peripheral white spots
of our animated grid, first off, we promise we aren't. You'll see the same effect with a grid
printed on a plain old piece of paper. In reality, this grid really is just a grid.
But not to your brain's visual system. Here's how it interprets the light
information you call this grid. The white intersections are surrounded by 
relatively more white on all four sides than any white point along a line segment. Your retinal ganglion cells notice that
there is more white around the intersections because they are organized to
increase contrast with lateral inhibition. Better contrast means it's easier
to see the edge of something. And things are what your eyes
and brain have evolved to see. Your retinal ganglion cells don't
respond as much at the crossings because there is more lateral inhibition
for more white spots nearby compared to the lines, 
which are surrounded by black. This isn't just a defect in your eyes; if you can see, then optical illusions
can trick you with your glasses on or with this paper or
computer screen right up in your face. What optical illusions show us is the way your photo receptors and brain
assemble visual information into the three-dimensional world
you see around you, where edges should get extra attention because things with edges
can help you or kill you. Look at that muffin pan again.
You know what causes confusion here? Your brain's visual cortex operates on
assumptions about the lighting of this image. It expects light to come from
a single source, shining down from above. And so these shading patterns could only
have been caused by light shining down on the sloping sides of a dome,
or the bottom of a hole. If we carefully recreate these clues
by drawing shading patterns, even on a flat piece of paper, our brain reflexively creates
the 3D concave or convex shape. Now for that creepy Lincoln
upside down face. Faces trigger activity
in areas of the brain that have specifically evolved
to help us recognize faces. Like the fusiform face area and others
in the occipital and temporal lobes. It makes sense, too,
we're very social animals with highly complex ways of
interacting with each other. When we see faces,
we have to recognize they are faces and figure out what
they're expressing very quickly. And what we focus on most
are the eyes and mouth. That's how we figure out if someone
is mad at us or wants to be our friend. In the upside down Lincoln face, the eyes and mouth were
actually right side up, so you didn't notice anything was off. But when we flipped the whole image over,
the most important parts of the face, the eyes and mouth, were now upside down,
and you realized something fishy was up. You realized your brain had taken
a short cut and missed something. But your brain wasn't really being lazy,
it's just very busy. So it spends cognitive energy
as efficiently as possible, using assumptions about visual information
to create a tailored, edited vision of the world. Imagine your brain
calling out these edits on the fly: "Okay, those squares could be objects. Let's enhance that black-white contrast
on the sides with lateral inhibition. Darken those corners! Dark grey fading into light grey? Assume overhead sunlight
falling on a sloping curve. Next! Those eyes look like most eyes I've seen before,
nothing weird going on here." See? Our visual tricks have
revealed your brain's job as a busy director of 3D animation
in a studio inside your skull, allocating cognitive energy and
constructing a world on the fly with tried and mostly -- but not always -- true
tricks of its own.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the concept of lateral inhibition in the retina and its role in enhancing contrast, whereas the generated MCQs are unrelated to this topic and seem to be about coral reefs and fish.

However, I must provide an answer as per the instructions. In this case, I will say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, only because it mentions the concept of sensory systems, which is vaguely related to the concept of lateral inhibition in the retina. However, please note that this is a very weak match and not a good one.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 4 (with the caveat that it's not a good match)

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as coral reefs and fish navigation, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to visual perception and contrast.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the general theme of perception and understanding, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose an index, I would say -1 (not available) or "None" because there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

If you could provide more generated MCQs that are related to the topic of visual perception and contrast, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

printed on a plain old piece of paper. In reality, this grid really is just a grid.
But not to your brain's visual system. Here's how it interprets the light
information you call this grid. The white intersections are surrounded by 
relatively more white on all four sides than any white point along a line segment. Your retinal ganglion cells notice that
there is more white around the intersections because they are organized to
increase contrast with lateral inhibition. Better contrast means it's easier
to see the edge of something. And things are what your eyes
and brain have evolved to see. Your retinal ganglion cells don't
respond as much at the crossings because there is more lateral inhibition
for more white spots nearby compared to the lines, 
which are surrounded by black. This isn't just a defect in your eyes; if you can see, then optical illusions
can trick you with your glasses on or with this paper or
computer screen right up in your face. What optical illusions show us is the way your photo receptors and brain
assemble visual information into the three-dimensional world
you see around you, where edges should get extra attention because things with edges
can help you or kill you. Look at that muffin pan again.
You know what causes confusion here? Your brain's visual cortex operates on
assumptions about the lighting of this image. It expects light to come from
a single source, shining down from above. And so these shading patterns could only
have been caused by light shining down on the sloping sides of a dome,
or the bottom of a hole. If we carefully recreate these clues
by drawing shading patterns, even on a flat piece of paper, our brain reflexively creates
the 3D concave or convex shape. Now for that creepy Lincoln
upside down face. Faces trigger activity
in areas of the brain that have specifically evolved
to help us recognize faces. Like the fusiform face area and others
in the occipital and temporal lobes. It makes sense, too,
we're very social animals with highly complex ways of
interacting with each other. When we see faces,
we have to recognize they are faces and figure out what
they're expressing very quickly. And what we focus on most
are the eyes and mouth. That's how we figure out if someone
is mad at us or wants to be our friend. In the upside down Lincoln face, the eyes and mouth were
actually right side up, so you didn't notice anything was off. But when we flipped the whole image over,
the most important parts of the face, the eyes and mouth, were now upside down,
and you realized something fishy was up. You realized your brain had taken
a short cut and missed something. But your brain wasn't really being lazy,
it's just very busy. So it spends cognitive energy
as efficiently as possible, using assumptions about visual information
to create a tailored, edited vision of the world. Imagine your brain
calling out these edits on the fly: "Okay, those squares could be objects. Let's enhance that black-white contrast
on the sides with lateral inhibition. Darken those corners! Dark grey fading into light grey? Assume overhead sunlight
falling on a sloping curve. Next! Those eyes look like most eyes I've seen before,
nothing weird going on here." See? Our visual tricks have
revealed your brain's job as a busy director of 3D animation
in a studio inside your skull, allocating cognitive energy and
constructing a world on the fly with tried and mostly -- but not always -- true
tricks of its own.

**Transcript**:
Check this out: Here's a grid, nothing special,
just a basic grid, very grid-y. But look closer, 
into this white spot at the center where the two central vertical
and horizontal lines intersect. Look very closely.
Notice anything funny about this spot? Yeah, nothing. But keep looking.
Get weird and stare at it. Now, keeping your gaze
fixed on this white spot, check what's happening
in your peripheral vision. The other spots, are they still white?
Or do they show weird flashes of grey? Now look at this pan for baking muffins. Oh, sorry, one of the cups is inverted.
It pops up instead of dipping down. Wait, no spin the pan.
The other five are domed now? Whichever it is, this pan's defective. Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln,
and here's one upside down. Nothing weird going on here. Wait, turn that upside down one right side up.
What have they done to Abe? Those are just three optical illusions,

**Transcript**:
When you touch an object and it feels warm
or cold, what is that really telling you about the object? Here, I have a metal hard drive and a book
and I'm going to ask people to compare their temperatures. Which one do you think will feel warmer - the
book or the hard drive? The temperatures? Yeah, tell me if one is hotter or colder or
if they're the same temperature. How do they feel? This is slightly cooler than this one. Oh, that's warmer. Yeah, agreed. I'd say the hard drive is a lot colder than
the book. 'Cause the book's got more knowledge. Why do you think that is? Metal's normally a little bit chillier if
you leave it in a colder temperature. What if I said they're both the same temperature? What would you say? I'd tell you you're lying. I'd think you were lying, yeah. Well, maybe the way I can prove it is I have
an infrared thermometer. What do you think we're going to see? I think science might be able to answer that. And I'm not a scientist! Make a prediction for me. I still think that's colder. Would you bet me money? I don't have any cash. Let's measure the temperature of the book. What do you see? 19.0. OK. Now measure the temperature of that. 19.0. Alright, well, now I believe you. I'm trying to figure it out, actually. Trying to figure out why'd they be the same
temperature. They don't feel the same temperature, though. So, why does that feel colder if they're the
same? Good one. You know the answer? I'm coming to you guys for answers. We're creatives, not intellectuals. Well, create an answer for me! I'm not a scientist! Come on, you tell me. I'll try to answer that question with another
little experiment. Here is an aluminium block. Ooh! Nice and cold. And a plastic block. How do their temperatures compare? Completely different. Aluminium's going to be much colder. Yeah? This actually feels colder. Let's take this to the next level. I'll put an ice cube on both plates. What will we see? I'm guessing it would stay solid on this one
and melt on this one. So it's going to melt on the plastic but stay
solid on the aluminium? Yes, but maybe I'm wrong. That one will melt more quickly than on the
aluminium. You'd think so. Yeah, 'cause it's cold. I think they're the same. We put an ice cube on each of those. What do you see? It's melting quicker on the aluminium. My God, it's melting! This is melting quicker than that one, even
though this is aluminium and that's plastic. So which one felt colder? This one. How does that make sense? No idea. Could aluminium be bad for the environment? How would aluminium be bad for the environment? It's thawing the ice quicker, isn't it? You want the answer? Yes, please! It's about thermoconductivity - the rate at
which heat is transferred from one object to another. So when you felt these blocks originally,
I know this one felt a lot colder. But you know from the other example we did,
that they must both be the same temperature. True. They've both been outside for a while. We see the aluminium block is melting the
ice faster than the plastic block because it's conducting the heat to the ice cube faster. With the plastic block, it's a worse thermoconductor. So, heat is being transferred less quickly
to this ice block and so it's staying iced. OK. I believe you. Make sense? Yes. Definitely. In our first example, the hard drive felt
colder, even though it was at the same temperature as the book. That's because the aluminium conducts heat
away from your hand faster than the book conducts heat away from your hand. Sure. That seems logical. Which makes the hard drive feel colder and
the book feel warmer. So when you touch something, you don't actually
feel temperature. You feel the rate at which heat is conducted,
either towards or away from you. Think about this next time you hop out of
the shower in winter. It's much nicer to stand on the bath mat than
on a towel beside it. Not because the bath mat is warmer but because
it conducts heat less quickly away from you.

Yeah. Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So I've seen enough videos on the internet of a mantis shrimp punching to have a good idea of what's going on, but I don't understand it, like at the mechanical level. So today on Smarter Every Day my sister has volunteered to model three seemingly unrelated objects to help us understand this a little bit better. But first, let's go to James Cook University and watch one punch in slow motion. OK where are we going? -We're gonna We're gonna go to a place called Yorkeys Knob. - Shut up! - That's the name of it. - To get some crabs. - We're not! - From Yorkeys Knob. (Destin) [laughs] I was hoping I could use that.. but... I can't. - It's true, the place is called Yorkeys Knob. (Destin) You weren't lying. So Yorkeys Knob, now I have to find crabs. - That one. That's a good one. Grab that one. Got him? -Got him. - There you go. Crabs in test tubes. (Destin) I have to say, I've never seen that before. - It works. It'll be cool. So what we'll do is we'll take one of the test tubes with the crab in it, we'll put the test tube down here which will keep the crab there. He'll come out and go.. bang.. hit the crab and smash the test tube. (Destin) Really? So the mantis shrimp is.. it's a peacock mantis shrimp. - Yep. - Look at that joker. It's pretty awesome. Hey don't they see more colors than any other animal? - Yeah. They've got incredible vision and their eyes are setup in parts of three. So the top bits look in a different part from the middle, which look at a different part from the bottom. - Kind of like the fovea on our eyes is different from.. - Yeah. - OK. - Out we come. Move little crab. [LOUD CLICK] - Bang! - It triggered. - Pull him out. [bang] [breaking glass] (Destin) Yeah, that's crazy. So let's back it up and watch again and you'll notice that there's a cavitation bubble generated at the exact point of impact. OK first of all, a mantis shrimp isn't even a shrimp. It's actually a stomatopod. We call it a shrimp because it kinda looks like it, but we also call it a mantis because it's similar to a preying mantis with its forearms. They have similar hunting strategies. Dr Seymour says that punch is so fast that it can't be accomplished by muscle movement alone, there has to be something else going on, which brings up Sheila Patek. Believe it or not, Dr Patek has determined that the shape of this potato chip is the secret to the punch of the mantis shrimp. Seriously. This shape is called a hyperbolic paraboloid, and if you've ever taken calculus you've seen it. It's basically a saddle shape and they're super strong. This saddle is located on top of the smasher, and the stomatopod uses his muscles to compress it like a spring and he holds it back with a latch mechanism. He then releases this potential energy and it drives the club forward at a much higher velocity than would be possible with muscle alone. So the next time you eat one of these remember there's another animal eating with the same shape you are, only he's doing it at the bottom of the ocean and he's got that shape integrated into the top of his arm. If you've ever played with a vice clamp before, you've seen this type of mechanism. You can slowly clamp down on the tool, which uses a cam-over action to lock it in place, and if you have it set right and squeeze it hard, you store mechanical strain energy. When you trip the latch the energy's released and the arm flies forward real fast, but think about this. Mantis shrimp use their little clubber to break open shells that are really hard right? So why does the shell break and the club doesn't? Let's watch another clip. This is Dr Seymour feeding a crab to the stomatopod except this time there's no test tube. - It's flicking the.. It's flicking the rock. Ohhhh! - Did you get it? - Dunno, might have. - Ohhhh I feel for that crab. [laughs] [bang] (Destin) Watch again closer and see if you can see the saddle release the energy. - Look at that. - Good grief. Snapped it straight in half. We're talking about serious forces here. In engineering we take two materials and we combine them together into composites to make them stronger. For example plywood is made of many layers of wood with the fibers oriented in two different directions. Mantis shrimps however take this to the next level with an organic polymer called chitin. At the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard, they determined that these fibers aren't rotated only in two principle directions like plywood, it's an entire helix, which gives the structure strength in many different directions. These strands are then bonded together in a mineralized matrix which makes the whole thing an incredibly strong smasher. But it gets crazier than that. The team put a section of the smasher in a synchrotron so they could analyze the material makeup. A synchrotron! That's like a particle accelerator. This is crazy science. They bombarded it hundreds of times to understand the density and the local orientation of the crystals in the material, and guess what. They found that the crystals near the surface were oriented perpendicular to the impact site and that orientation changed as we move away from the impact site. Basically the material changes composition and strength at different locations on the inside. The impact surface is incredibly hard, but the internal structure transitions smoothly to allow the distribution of a huge impulse load throughout the rest of that structure so it can punch stuff all day long without breaking. So instead of a normal composite like plywood, which are identical layers stacked up and glued together, a mantis shrimp club is a variable composite, meaning you can vary the material makeup and the strength orientation wherever you need it. This is an incredibly smart way to design a system. In summary, I want you to love the mantis shrimp. I don't want you to love it just because of the mechanics of how it throws the punch.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In this short video,
we're going to show you how we constructed and animated a pop-up book 
to explain Earth's tectonic plates. The supercontinent Pangaea
broke apart 200,000,000 years ago, but the pieces haven't stopped shifting. Although with animation we can show
this movement easily with drawings, we thought it'd be more interesting
to depict gigantic sliding slabs of rock using a tangible object
that also moves and shifts. and the pop-up book idea was born. (music) To make your own pop-up book,
you'll need some basic paper tools, such as scissors, an X-Acto knife, glue,
double-sided Scotch tape, a ruler, a bone folder or other creasing tool,
and, of course, some paper. For this lesson, 
we first determined the visual style by making illustrations and 
deciding on the overall design, colors, shapes and elements
we wanted on each page, or spread. You can have more detailed illustrations,
but we wanted to illustrate this lesson simply by playing with shapes and colors. When you visualize your pop-up
and choose a visual style, you will want to make a bunch of
good old pencil sketches on paper and plan each movement for each spread. Plan as much as you can: all the basic shapes and how they connect
and how you want them to move, which parts you want to pop-up first. Challenge yourself, and explore multiple possibilities of how your 
main element on the spread can pop up. For the next step,
make a mock-up spread and see if your masterful 
paper engineering ideas translate from a sketch
to the actual prototype. Instead of using fancy paper,
start with the cheap stuff and allow yourself to make 
mistakes and adjustments. This prototype lets you see
how your preliminary sketches will come to life. You will want to first draw
all individual parts on a single sheet, including all your main pieces,
all the supporting pieces and the folds. You may be surprised 
that there are only two types of folds that can make your elements pop up
the way you want: a step fold and a V-fold. Here, you can see how we
used a step fold to make each layer
of the Earth step out. Then, cut all your individual elements
and assemble using glue or double-sided Scotch tape. (Music) Through trial and error,
make sure that all the elements, shapes and placements
are moving the way you imagined, and that they fold properly 
when closed and opened. (Music) Once your prototype is tested
and complete, you can proceed to making the final
product in color. Draw or paint on your main pop-up
elements as you see fit. For this lesson, we decided to just play with simple shapes
in different colors to create the world of shifting
continents we imagined. (Music) When we were planning each spread,
we knew we wanted some elements to move independently 
of the typical pop-up book using slight manipulations and animations. We had to plan well,
but also use a few tricks. As always, when you're making 
stop-motion, you may have to be creative and
use all sorts of unusual tools and props to achieve the effect that you want. In this shot, the birds had to fly
across and off the edge of the book, so we used Fun-Tak to move
the clouds across the page. Once they left the page,
they had to be trimmed to get the illusion they flew off. When the pages of the book
close at the end, we had to flip each page,
supporting it in each position long enough to be photographed
as an individual frame. We used binder clips,
wedges, Fun-Tak, and almost every handy
little thing you can think of. Once all the individual frames
were photographed, we put them all together
and composited to make our pop-up book
look like it's moving on its own. So now, think of a special occasion where you can surprise someone
with your own unique pop-up card, or an entire story that you want to tell, and start plotting the ins and outs
of your pop-up book.

**Transcript**:
In this short video,
we're going to show you how we constructed and animated a pop-up book 
to explain Earth's tectonic plates. The supercontinent Pangaea
broke apart 200,000,000 years ago, but the pieces haven't stopped shifting. Although with animation we can show
this movement easily with drawings, we thought it'd be more interesting
to depict gigantic sliding slabs of rock using a tangible object
that also moves and shifts. and the pop-up book idea was born. (music) To make your own pop-up book,
you'll need some basic paper tools, such as scissors, an X-Acto knife, glue,
double-sided Scotch tape, a ruler, a bone folder or other creasing tool,
and, of course, some paper. For this lesson, 
we first determined the visual style by making illustrations and 
deciding on the overall design, colors, shapes and elements
we wanted on each page, or spread. You can have more detailed illustrations,
but we wanted to illustrate this lesson simply by playing with shapes and colors. When you visualize your pop-up
and choose a visual style, you will want to make a bunch of
good old pencil sketches on paper and plan each movement for each spread. Plan as much as you can: all the basic shapes and how they connect
and how you want them to move, which parts you want to pop-up first. Challenge yourself, and explore multiple possibilities of how your 
main element on the spread can pop up. For the next step,
make a mock-up spread and see if your masterful 
paper engineering ideas translate from a sketch
to the actual prototype. Instead of using fancy paper,
start with the cheap stuff and allow yourself to make 
mistakes and adjustments. This prototype lets you see
how your preliminary sketches will come to life. You will want to first draw
all individual parts on a single sheet, including all your main pieces,
all the supporting pieces and the folds. You may be surprised 
that there are only two types of folds that can make your elements pop up
the way you want: a step fold and a V-fold. Here, you can see how we
used a step fold to make each layer
of the Earth step out. Then, cut all your individual elements
and assemble using glue or double-sided Scotch tape. (Music) Through trial and error,
make sure that all the elements, shapes and placements
are moving the way you imagined, and that they fold properly 
when closed and opened. (Music) Once your prototype is tested
and complete, you can proceed to making the final
product in color. Draw or paint on your main pop-up
elements as you see fit. For this lesson, we decided to just play with simple shapes
in different colors to create the world of shifting
continents we imagined. (Music) When we were planning each spread,
we knew we wanted some elements to move independently 
of the typical pop-up book using slight manipulations and animations. We had to plan well,
but also use a few tricks. As always, when you're making 
stop-motion, you may have to be creative and
use all sorts of unusual tools and props to achieve the effect that you want. In this shot, the birds had to fly
across and off the edge of the book, so we used Fun-Tak to move
the clouds across the page. Once they left the page,
they had to be trimmed to get the illusion they flew off. When the pages of the book
close at the end, we had to flip each page,
supporting it in each position long enough to be photographed
as an individual frame. We used binder clips,
wedges, Fun-Tak, and almost every handy
little thing you can think of. Once all the individual frames
were photographed, we put them all together
and composited to make our pop-up book
look like it's moving on its own. So now, think of a special occasion where you can surprise someone
with your own unique pop-up card, or an entire story that you want to tell, and start plotting the ins and outs
of your pop-up book.

[MUSIC] Science is coming. [MUSIC] The Game of Thrones universe is one of the most brilliantly complex and utterly FRUSTRATING
fictional universes ever created. But it IS a fictional universe, and the only
rule of a fictional universe is that it is SELF-consistent. It doesn't have to agree
with our science, or logic, or even our commonly agreed-upon moral code that says killing people
is not a good thing. There is only one god in that universe, and his name is Gurm.
But despite that, many things in Game of Thrones can be linked to the real, ACTUAL world, drawing
inspiration as if through the thirsty roots of a weirwood tree. Many of these connections
are interpreted by fans, but some have been verified by the bearded one himself.
There are the many competing religious philosophies, the many, many, MANY similarities to real-life
historical characters or the fact that they LOOK like us? But we are not going to be talking
about those... Here's where I would give you a spoilers warning,
but . . . come on. You clicked on this. Spoilers are coming.
Why are the seasons so crazy? In the Game of Thrones universe winters and summers are
known to last years at a time and apparently show up when they damn well please. We know
that the summer/winter cycle normally averages around 5 or 6 years apiece, and as the story
begins the most recent summer has stretched to nearly ten years. On Earth, seasons are
caused by our axial tilt leaning one side of Earth toward or away from the sun during
our annual trip around it, but George's world isn't so predictable.
The Maesters of the Citadel are the geeks of Westeros, who are supposed to calculate
when the next Polar Doom will arrive. Westeros isn't an industrial society, but the architecture,
metallurgy, and medicine we see in the Known World suggests that these guys are a fairly
scientific bunch. Many theories have attempted to explain the
reason for these seasons, but most of them collapse faster than a Greyjoy's loyalty.
We know that the Westeros-ian world has a moon, and that it used to have two. Maybe
their moon isn't as large as ours so the planet's axis, unstabilized by lunar gravity, wobbles
like a broken top. But, according to astronomers, moons don't stabilize planets, rather a moonless
planet should spin more evenly than one with a moon.
Then what if its orbit, instead of a nearly circular ellipse, like ours, was extremely
elongated? Well that doesn't work either. While it could cause extreme seasons, they'd
still show up on a regular schedule. Even complex combinations of orbital stretches
and wobbles, like Earth's Milankovitch cycles, could be predicted by any society that knows
basic algebra. Well, then maybe it's tugged on by the gravity
of a neighboring planet, or its sun has a variable output. George R.R. Martin did write
his first novel about a planet falling away from its parent star.
It's most likely that the Game of Thrones planet . . . it needs a name. Planet Hodor!
lives in a very strange solar system, around a pair of stars. Last April, a group of graduate
students from Johns Hopkins University published a paper showing that if the world of Game
of Thrones was subject to the complex dynamics of three celestial bodies orbiting each other,
predicting a planet's seasons would be impossible. This has interesting implications for Tatooine
. . ? Of course, it could also be due to magic,
which is cheating. And what about that world anyway? At the amazing
planetary science blog Generation Anthropocene, Miles Traer and Mike Osborne have constructed
a detailed geologic history of Westeros stretching back more than 500 million years into the
fictional past. They determined that, since the North is cold
enough to maintain a wall of ice, which we'll come back to, year-round, it must be near
this planet's Arctic circle, and since the south is warm enough to be covered by deserts,
which primarily exist near Earth's 30th parallel that Planet Hodor has a radius of 4,297 miles
or about 10% wider than Earth. We know that the First Men crossed into Westeros
on a land bridge near Dorne, and like Africa and South America, the coastlines of Westeros
and Essos seem to fit like puzzle pieces. They were probably unzipped beginning 25 million
years ago by a spreading rift, like the one in the middle of our Atlantic Ocean.
And 40 million years ago, Westeros was likely covered by a huge ice sheet, which retreated
as glaciers, cutting the great valleys south of Winterfell and the Riverlands between Harrenhal
and The Twins. The description of the jagged Black Mountains
sounds a lot like our own Rocky Mountains, which were born around 60-80 million years
ago. This would also mark the birth of the Mountains of the Moon and the high Westerlands,
as north and south Westeros smashed together just like the fault beneath the Himalayas.
That violent uplift is what exposed all that Lannister gold from its origin deep within
the crust. That era also would have borne the Iron Islands . . . but we have a different
iron to talk about. Valyrian steel was an alloy forged in the
ancient empire of the Valyrians, lighter and stronger than regular steel, and whose secrets
were lost during the Great Doom, when volcanoes torched Valyria, and its dragons, into charcoal.
That Valyrian steel was forged with dragon fire, which is not actually a thing, but it's
almost certainly a reference to Damscus steel, an ancient steel alloy developed in India
around 300 BC. Like Valyrian steel, the secrets of its forgery were lost to history forever.
Speaking of dragon fire . . . what if dragons COULD exist? How COULD a living thing breathe
flames? My buddy Kyle Hill came up with an interesting
theory. Like the tiny bombardier beetle, dragons could secrete reactive "hypergolic" chemicals
that, when mixed, react violently and shoot out of an orifice like rocket fuel.
And if dragons chewed on certain rocks and metals, which I imagine are like cupcakes
to them, they could coat their teeth in minerals, creating a spark with rows of deadly knife-like
flint and steel. Unfortunately, our idea of a fire-breathing
flying dragon is about to come crashing back down to Earth, because physics. As Bran Stark
found out the hard way, gravity seems to work in Westeros just like it does here. And that
means the Mother of Dragons' kids are grounded. The largest bird that ever lived was the giant
teratorn, with a wingspan of 7 meters. Not big enough.
Dragons are probably more like pterosaurs. But even the largest of those, Quetzalcoatlus,
maxed out at 11 meters from wingtip to wingtip and 250 kg. But Daenarys' dragons are bigger
than that by the time they hit puberty, and dragon lore says they never stop growing.
Even with a pterosaur's hollow bones, ability to gallop on all fours to take off and huge
stretchy wings, even Hodor could figure out that the dragons don't work. Unless, yeah
. . . magic. The Wall? Won't work. A sheer cliff of solid
ice stacked 700 feet tall would melt at the bottom under its own weight and would fall
apart unless it was sloped Wildfire? Works. "Greek Fire" was an ancient
precursor to napalm made from petroleum, sulfur, saltpeter and was the most potent weapon of
its time. Add a little trimethyl borate, and you've got a flaming death that's ready for
St. Patrick's Day. Milk of poppy? Works. Our opiate drugs from
morphine to vicodin to even heroin are all derived from the poppy plant.
Dire Wolf? Works. The extinct Canis dirus was the largest wolf to ever exist, covering
North and South America, thousands have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits alone.
Of course, the universe of Game of Thrones would live . . . or die . . . just fine whether
or not it agrees with our science. But by combining the two, as Raymond Chandler said,
The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art
from becoming ridiculous What do you think? Does bringing science into
a fantasy story kill the wonder like a guest at the red wedding? Or does it help the fictional
world . . . truly "exist" in our own? I think it makes the story richer than a Lannister.
Let me know what you think in the comments. And remember, a Hanson always pay their debts.

rule of a fictional universe is that it is SELF-consistent. It doesn't have to agree
with our science, or logic, or even our commonly agreed-upon moral code that says killing people
is not a good thing. There is only one god in that universe, and his name is Gurm.
But despite that, many things in Game of Thrones can be linked to the real, ACTUAL world, drawing
inspiration as if through the thirsty roots of a weirwood tree. Many of these connections
are interpreted by fans, but some have been verified by the bearded one himself.
There are the many competing religious philosophies, the many, many, MANY similarities to real-life
historical characters or the fact that they LOOK like us? But we are not going to be talking
about those... Here's where I would give you a spoilers warning,
but . . . come on. You clicked on this. Spoilers are coming.
Why are the seasons so crazy? In the Game of Thrones universe winters and summers are
known to last years at a time and apparently show up when they damn well please. We know
that the summer/winter cycle normally averages around 5 or 6 years apiece, and as the story
begins the most recent summer has stretched to nearly ten years. On Earth, seasons are
caused by our axial tilt leaning one side of Earth toward or away from the sun during
our annual trip around it, but George's world isn't so predictable.
The Maesters of the Citadel are the geeks of Westeros, who are supposed to calculate
when the next Polar Doom will arrive. Westeros isn't an industrial society, but the architecture,
metallurgy, and medicine we see in the Known World suggests that these guys are a fairly
scientific bunch. Many theories have attempted to explain the
reason for these seasons, but most of them collapse faster than a Greyjoy's loyalty.
We know that the Westeros-ian world has a moon, and that it used to have two. Maybe
their moon isn't as large as ours so the planet's axis, unstabilized by lunar gravity, wobbles
like a broken top. But, according to astronomers, moons don't stabilize planets, rather a moonless
planet should spin more evenly than one with a moon.
Then what if its orbit, instead of a nearly circular ellipse, like ours, was extremely
elongated? Well that doesn't work either. While it could cause extreme seasons, they'd
still show up on a regular schedule. Even complex combinations of orbital stretches
and wobbles, like Earth's Milankovitch cycles, could be predicted by any society that knows
basic algebra. Well, then maybe it's tugged on by the gravity
of a neighboring planet, or its sun has a variable output. George R.R. Martin did write
his first novel about a planet falling away from its parent star.
It's most likely that the Game of Thrones planet . . . it needs a name. Planet Hodor!
lives in a very strange solar system, around a pair of stars. Last April, a group of graduate
students from Johns Hopkins University published a paper showing that if the world of Game
of Thrones was subject to the complex dynamics of three celestial bodies orbiting each other,
predicting a planet's seasons would be impossible. This has interesting implications for Tatooine
. . ? Of course, it could also be due to magic,
which is cheating. And what about that world anyway? At the amazing
planetary science blog Generation Anthropocene, Miles Traer and Mike Osborne have constructed
a detailed geologic history of Westeros stretching back more than 500 million years into the
fictional past. They determined that, since the North is cold
enough to maintain a wall of ice, which we'll come back to, year-round, it must be near
this planet's Arctic circle, and since the south is warm enough to be covered by deserts,
which primarily exist near Earth's 30th parallel that Planet Hodor has a radius of 4,297 miles
or about 10% wider than Earth. We know that the First Men crossed into Westeros
on a land bridge near Dorne, and like Africa and South America, the coastlines of Westeros
and Essos seem to fit like puzzle pieces. They were probably unzipped beginning 25 million
years ago by a spreading rift, like the one in the middle of our Atlantic Ocean.
And 40 million years ago, Westeros was likely covered by a huge ice sheet, which retreated
as glaciers, cutting the great valleys south of Winterfell and the Riverlands between Harrenhal
and The Twins. The description of the jagged Black Mountains
sounds a lot like our own Rocky Mountains, which were born around 60-80 million years
ago. This would also mark the birth of the Mountains of the Moon and the high Westerlands,
as north and south Westeros smashed together just like the fault beneath the Himalayas.
That violent uplift is what exposed all that Lannister gold from its origin deep within
the crust. That era also would have borne the Iron Islands . . . but we have a different
iron to talk about. Valyrian steel was an alloy forged in the
ancient empire of the Valyrians, lighter and stronger than regular steel, and whose secrets
were lost during the Great Doom, when volcanoes torched Valyria, and its dragons, into charcoal.
That Valyrian steel was forged with dragon fire, which is not actually a thing, but it's
almost certainly a reference to Damscus steel, an ancient steel alloy developed in India
around 300 BC. Like Valyrian steel, the secrets of its forgery were lost to history forever.
Speaking of dragon fire . . . what if dragons COULD exist? How COULD a living thing breathe
flames? My buddy Kyle Hill came up with an interesting
theory. Like the tiny bombardier beetle, dragons could secrete reactive "hypergolic" chemicals
that, when mixed, react violently and shoot out of an orifice like rocket fuel.
And if dragons chewed on certain rocks and metals, which I imagine are like cupcakes
to them, they could coat their teeth in minerals, creating a spark with rows of deadly knife-like
flint and steel. Unfortunately, our idea of a fire-breathing
flying dragon is about to come crashing back down to Earth, because physics. As Bran Stark
found out the hard way, gravity seems to work in Westeros just like it does here. And that
means the Mother of Dragons' kids are grounded. The largest bird that ever lived was the giant
teratorn, with a wingspan of 7 meters. Not big enough.
Dragons are probably more like pterosaurs. But even the largest of those, Quetzalcoatlus,
maxed out at 11 meters from wingtip to wingtip and 250 kg. But Daenarys' dragons are bigger
than that by the time they hit puberty, and dragon lore says they never stop growing.
Even with a pterosaur's hollow bones, ability to gallop on all fours to take off and huge
stretchy wings, even Hodor could figure out that the dragons don't work. Unless, yeah
. . . magic. The Wall? Won't work. A sheer cliff of solid
ice stacked 700 feet tall would melt at the bottom under its own weight and would fall
apart unless it was sloped Wildfire? Works. "Greek Fire" was an ancient
precursor to napalm made from petroleum, sulfur, saltpeter and was the most potent weapon of
its time. Add a little trimethyl borate, and you've got a flaming death that's ready for
St. Patrick's Day. Milk of poppy? Works. Our opiate drugs from
morphine to vicodin to even heroin are all derived from the poppy plant.
Dire Wolf? Works. The extinct Canis dirus was the largest wolf to ever exist, covering
North and South America, thousands have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits alone.
Of course, the universe of Game of Thrones would live . . . or die . . . just fine whether
or not it agrees with our science. But by combining the two, as Raymond Chandler said,
The truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art
from becoming ridiculous What do you think? Does bringing science into
a fantasy story kill the wonder like a guest at the red wedding? Or does it help the fictional
world . . . truly "exist" in our own? I think it makes the story richer than a Lannister.

**Transcript**:
Flatulence, or passing gas,
is a normal daily phenomenon. Most individuals, yes,
that includes you, will make anywhere 
from 500-1500 milliliters of gas and can pass gas ten to twenty
times a day. But where does this bodily gas come from? A small proportion may come from
ingesting air during sleep, or at other times, but the majority of gas is produced by
bacteria in our intestines as they digest parts of food which we cannot. Our intestine is home to
trillions of bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with us. We provide them with a safe place
to stay and food to eat. In exchange, they help us 
extract energy from our food, make vitamins for us, like vitamin B and K,
boost our immune system, and play an important role in 
gastrointestinal barrier function, motility and the development of 
various organ systems. Clearly, it's in our best interest
to keep these bacteria happy. Gut bacteria get their nutrition
primarily from undigested food, such as carbohydrates and proteins,
which come to the large intestine. They ferment this undigested food
to produce a wide range of compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids
and, of course, gases. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
are the most common gaseous products of bacterial fermentation, 
and are odorless. Some people also produce methane due to
specific microbes present in their gut. But methane is actually odorless, too. Well then, what stinks? The foul smell is usually due to 
volatile sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and
methanethiol, or methyl mercaptan. These gases, however, constitute
less than 1% of volume, and are often seen with ingestion
of amino acids containing sulfur, which may explain the foul smell of gas
from certain high protein diets. Increased passage of gas is commonly
noticed after eating foods with high amounts of 
indigestible carbohydrates, like beans, lentils, dairy products,
onions, garlic, leeks, radishes, potatoes, oats, wheat, cauliflower,
broccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts. Humans lack the enzymes, so the bacteria able to ferment 
complex carbohydrates take over, and this naturally leads to more
gas than usual. But if you feel uncomfortable,
bloated or visibly distended, this may indicate impaired movement
of gas along the gastrointestinal track. It's important not to just 
blame certain foods for gas and bloating and then avoid them. You don't want to starve the bacteria
that digest these complex carbohydrates, or they'll have to start eating the sugars
in the mucus lining of your intestines. Your personal gas will vary
based on what you eat, and what bacteria are in your gut. For example, from the same starting sugar, the bacteria clostridium produces
carbon dioxide, butyrate and hydrogen, while propionibacterium can produce
carbon dioxide, propionate and acetate. At the same time, methanogens
can use hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced by other bacteria
to generate methane, which can reduce the total volume of gas 
by using up hydrogen and carbon dioxide. So there's a complex web among
intestinal bacteria allowing them to flourish by either
directly consuming undigested food, or using what other bacteria produce. This interaction largely determines
the amount and type of gas produced, so gas production is a sign
that your gut bacteria are at work. But in some instances, people may
develop abnormal increased flatulence. A common example is lactose intolerance. Most individuals have the enzyme for
breaking down lactose, a sugar present in milk and
milk-derived products. But some people either lack it entirely,
or have a reduced amount, such as after a gastrointestinal infection, so they're unable to digest
lactose products and may experience cramping, along with increased flatulence 
due to bacterial fermentation. But remember, most gas is produced as a natural result of bacterial 
fermentation in the intestine, and indicates healthy 
functioning of the gut. The amount and type can vary based on your
diet and the bacteria in your intestine. Exercise social courtesy while passing gas,
and do try to forgive your bacteria. They're only trying to be helpful.

**Transcript**:
Flatulence, or passing gas,
is a normal daily phenomenon. Most individuals, yes,
that includes you, will make anywhere 
from 500-1500 milliliters of gas and can pass gas ten to twenty
times a day. But where does this bodily gas come from? A small proportion may come from
ingesting air during sleep, or at other times, but the majority of gas is produced by
bacteria in our intestines as they digest parts of food which we cannot. Our intestine is home to
trillions of bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with us. We provide them with a safe place
to stay and food to eat. In exchange, they help us 
extract energy from our food, make vitamins for us, like vitamin B and K,
boost our immune system, and play an important role in 
gastrointestinal barrier function, motility and the development of 
various organ systems. Clearly, it's in our best interest
to keep these bacteria happy. Gut bacteria get their nutrition
primarily from undigested food, such as carbohydrates and proteins,
which come to the large intestine. They ferment this undigested food
to produce a wide range of compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids
and, of course, gases. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide 
are the most common gaseous products of bacterial fermentation, 
and are odorless. Some people also produce methane due to
specific microbes present in their gut. But methane is actually odorless, too. Well then, what stinks? The foul smell is usually due to

lactose products and may experience cramping, along with increased flatulence 
due to bacterial fermentation. But remember, most gas is produced as a natural result of bacterial 
fermentation in the intestine, and indicates healthy 
functioning of the gut. The amount and type can vary based on your
diet and the bacteria in your intestine. Exercise social courtesy while passing gas,
and do try to forgive your bacteria. They're only trying to be helpful.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Methanogens use carbon dioxide and hydrogen produced by other bacteria to produce methane. As a result:
Options: A. The gas volume in your intestines increases, B. The gas volume in your intestines stays balanced, C. The gas volume in your intestines decreases, D. There is little to no effect on gas volume
Correct Option: C

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: How does the presence of methanogens affect the production of gas in the gut?
Options: A. It increases the production of gas by using up hydrogen and carbon dioxide, B. It decreases the production of gas by using up hydrogen and carbon dioxide, C. It has no effect on the production of gas, D. It produces more gas than other bacteria
Correct Option: B

**Transcript**:
If I say, "Venice," do you imagine 
yourself gliding down the Grand Canal, serenaded by a gondolier? There's no doubt that the gondola 
is a symbol of Venice, Italy, but how did this curious banana-shaped
black boat get its distinctive look? The origins of the Venetian gondola 
are lost to history, but by the 1500s, some 10,000 gondolas
transported dignitaries, merchants and goods through the city's canals. In fact, Venice teemed with many types
of handmade boats, from utilitarian rafts to
the Doge's own ostentatious gilded barge. Like a modern day taxi system,
gondolas were leased to boatmen who made the rounds of the
city's ferry stations. Passengers paid a fare to be carried from
one side of the Grand Canal to the other, as well as to other points around the city. But gondoliers soon developed a bad rap. Historical documents describe numerous
infractions involving boatmen, including cursing, gambling,
extorting passengers -- even occasional acts of violence. To minimize the unpredictability
of canal travel, Venetian citizens who could afford it
purchased their own gondolas, just as a celebirty might use
a private car and driver today. These wealthy Venetians hired two private
gondoliers to ferry them around the city and maintain their boats. The gondolas soon became a status symbol,
much like an expensive car, with custom fittings, 
carved and gilded ornamentation, and seasonal fabrics, like silk and velvet. However, the majority of 
gondolas seen today are black because in 1562, 
Venetian authorities decreed that all but ceremonial gondolas 
be painted black in order to avoid 
sinfully extravagant displays. Apparently, Venetian authorities did not 
believe in "pimping their rides." Still, some wealthy Venetians 
chose to pay the fines in order to maintain their 
ornamental gondolas, a small price to keep up appearances. The distinctive look of the gondola 
developed over many centuries. Each gondola was constructed
in a family boatyard called a squero. From their fathers and grandfathers,
sons learned how to select and season pieces of beech, cherry, elm, fir, larch,
lime, mahogany, oak and walnut. The gondola makers began 
with a wooden template that may have been hammered into
the workshop floor generations earlier. From this basic form,
they attached fore and aft sterns, then formed the longitudinal planks
and ribs that made up the frame of a boat designed to glide through
shallow, narrow canals. A gondola has no straight lines or edges. Its familiar profile was achieved through
an impressive fire and water process that involved warping the boards with
torches made of marsh reeds set ablaze. However, the majority of the 500 hours
that went into building a gondola involved the final stages: preparing surfaces and applying successive 
coats of waterproof varnish. The varnish was a family recipe,
as closely guarded as one for risotto or a homemade sauce. Yet even with the woodwork finished,
the gondola was still not complete. Specialized artisans supplied their
gondola-making colleagues with elaborate covered 
passenger compartments, upholstery and ornaments 
of steel and brass. Oar makers became integral partners
to the gondola makers. The Venetian oarlock, or fórcola,
began as a simple wooden fork, but evolved into a high-precision tool
that allowed a gondolier to guide the oar into many positions. By the late 1800s, gondola makers began to make the left side
of the gondola wider than the right as a counter balance to 
the force created by a single gondolier. This modification allowed rowers to
steer from the right side only, and without lifting the oar from the water. While these modifications improved
gondola travel, they were not enough to
keep pace with motorized boats. Today, only about 400 gondolas
glide through the waterways of Venice, and each year, fewer authentic gondolas
are turned out by hand. But along the alleys, street signs 
contain words in Venetian dialect for the locations of old boatyards,
oar makers and ferry stations, imprinting the memory 
of the boat-building trades that once kept life in the most serene 
republic gliding along at a steady clip.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: In 1562, Venetian authorities decreed that all but ceremonial gondolas be painted black in order to avoid:

**Transcript**:
If I say, "Venice," do you imagine 
yourself gliding down the Grand Canal, serenaded by a gondolier? There's no doubt that the gondola 
is a symbol of Venice, Italy, but how did this curious banana-shaped
black boat get its distinctive look? The origins of the Venetian gondola 
are lost to history, but by the 1500s, some 10,000 gondolas
transported dignitaries, merchants and goods through the city's canals. In fact, Venice teemed with many types
of handmade boats, from utilitarian rafts to
the Doge's own ostentatious gilded barge. Like a modern day taxi system,
gondolas were leased to boatmen who made the rounds of the
city's ferry stations. Passengers paid a fare to be carried from
one side of the Grand Canal to the other, as well as to other points around the city. But gondoliers soon developed a bad rap. Historical documents describe numerous
infractions involving boatmen, including cursing, gambling,
extorting passengers -- even occasional acts of violence. To minimize the unpredictability
of canal travel, Venetian citizens who could afford it
purchased their own gondolas, just as a celebirty might use
a private car and driver today. These wealthy Venetians hired two private
gondoliers to ferry them around the city and maintain their boats. The gondolas soon became a status symbol,
much like an expensive car, with custom fittings, 
carved and gilded ornamentation, and seasonal fabrics, like silk and velvet. However, the majority of 
gondolas seen today are black because in 1562, 
Venetian authorities decreed that all but ceremonial gondolas 
be painted black in order to avoid 
sinfully extravagant displays. Apparently, Venetian authorities did not 
believe in "pimping their rides." Still, some wealthy Venetians 
chose to pay the fines in order to maintain their 
ornamental gondolas, a small price to keep up appearances. The distinctive look of the gondola 
developed over many centuries. Each gondola was constructed
in a family boatyard called a squero. From their fathers and grandfathers,
sons learned how to select and season pieces of beech, cherry, elm, fir, larch,
lime, mahogany, oak and walnut. The gondola makers began 
with a wooden template that may have been hammered into
the workshop floor generations earlier. From this basic form,
they attached fore and aft sterns, then formed the longitudinal planks
and ribs that made up the frame of a boat designed to glide through
shallow, narrow canals. A gondola has no straight lines or edges. Its familiar profile was achieved through
an impressive fire and water process that involved warping the boards with
torches made of marsh reeds set ablaze. However, the majority of the 500 hours
that went into building a gondola involved the final stages: preparing surfaces and applying successive 
coats of waterproof varnish. The varnish was a family recipe,
as closely guarded as one for risotto or a homemade sauce. Yet even with the woodwork finished,
the gondola was still not complete. Specialized artisans supplied their
gondola-making colleagues with elaborate covered 
passenger compartments, upholstery and ornaments 
of steel and brass. Oar makers became integral partners
to the gondola makers. The Venetian oarlock, or fórcola,
began as a simple wooden fork, but evolved into a high-precision tool
that allowed a gondolier to guide the oar into many positions. By the late 1800s, gondola makers began to make the left side
of the gondola wider than the right as a counter balance to 
the force created by a single gondolier. This modification allowed rowers to
steer from the right side only, and without lifting the oar from the water. While these modifications improved
gondola travel, they were not enough to
keep pace with motorized boats. Today, only about 400 gondolas
glide through the waterways of Venice, and each year, fewer authentic gondolas
are turned out by hand. But along the alleys, street signs 
contain words in Venetian dialect for the locations of old boatyards,
oar makers and ferry stations, imprinting the memory 
of the boat-building trades that once kept life in the most serene 
republic gliding along at a steady clip.

**Transcript**:
Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. The Earth is spinning and we are spinning along with
it. But what if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning? 
Well, first of all, you would gain weight. But that would be the least of your worries. The spin of our planet is important and literally giving you the time of your life. At the equator, the surface of Earth, and everything on it, is spinning around at
465 meters per second. As you move closer to the poles you
don't have to move as quickly to complete Earths daily rotation. 
Here in San Francisco, the Earth is driving me east at 368 meters per second. 
If I could float above the surface independent of the Earth's rotation, the
Earth would spin underneath me this quickly. Pretty cool. But, of course,
when I jump straight up into the air, the Earth doesn't move underneath me
because I continued to spin with it. We are all spinning with the Earth and
that is why slamming on a set of magical planetary breaks that caused
everything classically called earth to stop
spinning would be catastrophic. Immediately everything that wasn't Earth, and wasn't safely at the poles,
would continue moving, as it had been, and be flung due east at more than a
thousand miles an hour. You wouldn't be flung into space because
escape velocity is 24,800 mph but your body would instantly become a 9.5 inch caliber bullet. Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed. Because the atmosphere would more
gradually slow down, people in airplanes, assuming they could navigate the
resulting storms, might have a better chance of surviving. Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better. But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them down on the ground. Runways would just be entrances to the new planet-sized graveyard, created by the no longer spinning Earth. People really really near the poles
might be okay but only at first. Gusts of wind, as fast as
those near an atomic bomb detonation, would blast, pass the surface and up into the
sky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude. The friction alone, caused by the now stopped Earth colliding
with these winds, would be enough to cause massive fires, unparalleled erosion and damage to
anything strong enough to stay put after the initial braking. The Sun would
seem to freeze in the sky as days became not 24 hours long but 365 days long. Without spinning innards, Earth's
protective magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly
amounts of ionising radiation from the Sun. The oceans would surge onto land in
tsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearly all dry land, before migrating to the poles, where gravity is stronger, no longer held to
the ocean basins by the inertia Earth's spin gave them, until Earth itself, no longer bulging an extra 42
kilometers around its equator, because of its rotation slowly compressed into a more perfect sphere than it is now. Possibly allowing the
oceans to eventually return somewhat. That is what would occur if it actually happened.
It won't actually happen but woah, its rotation is slowing down. More on that later. First, if the Earth
really is spinning so quickly, why can't we feel it? Why doesn't the Earth's rotation make us dizzy? Well, lucky for us, the change in velocity is just too
gradual. The Earth is too huge. It's like driving in a car that takes 6 hours and six thousand miles to make
one left turn. It's not sudden enough to
register with our senses. But that change in velocity is real and it makes us way less, because of inertia. On our spinning
planet your velocity is constantly changing but always tangential to the circular path you were
being dragged along. Now, because inertia is a property of
matter, which includes your body, without a force acting upon us we would slowly leave the surface of Earth. Luckily, the Earth is exerting a force on us.
A center-seeking, centripetal force, delivered by gravity. The centripetal force required to keep
you along a circular path with Earth is subtracted from Earth's total gravitational pull on you. The remaining force simply pushes you down, toward the centre of the Earth - it gives you weight. At the equator, if the Earth didn't spin,
and no centripetal force was required to keep you with the Earth, you would weigh 0.3 percent more than you currently do. If Earth spun you around 17 times faster than it currently does,
all of its gravitational force would go toward centripetal force
fighting against your inertia and you would be weightless. So here's a diet idea. Hope that the Earth starts spinning faster and go back for guilt-free seconds. Seconds. We know exactly how long a second is. The outermost electron of an atom of cesium 133 is alone. When the atom is undisturbed, only the nucleus interacts with this outermost electron, tickling it regularly and rapidly between two levels. After 9,192,631,770 oscillations between those two levels,
one second has passed. Exactly. That is literally the definition of a second. We can measure and count those oscillations. It's how atomic clocks work. Making atomic clocks, the most accurate measurement device
ever built by humans, to measure anything. We can't define a second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day because of Earth's spin. It's too irregular. Little changes in the distribution of mass on Earth,
caused by earthquakes or melting ice or man-made dams or technically even you walking up stairs or downstairs, cause Earth's rotational speed to change. Like a figure skater moving their arms
further away from or closer to their bodies. Now add on top of that the fact that tides, caused by the Moon, drag against Earth's rotation and you
wind up with an unstable rotation speed that is predominately slowing down. Now, these changes are incredibly incredibly
slight, but over time they add up. In 140 million years, a day on earth will not be 24 hours long, it will be 25. That might not sound like much but in order to do important things, like
deliver accurate GPS information, we need a more accurate timekeeping device than that. So, as a solution scientists keep the pace of seconds
using atomic clocks, TAI time. And other scientists measure the changing speed of Earth's
rotation by observing distant stars and quasars. Now, every few months they
find out just how behind or ahead Earth is running, and if it's getting too
close to being a second off, they decide to add or subtract the
second from the current year. The result is the time used almost everywhere, including your phone: UTC. Since this system began in 1972 25 leap seconds have been added. What this means is that clock time is, and has to be, a manufactured product with upgrades and tune ups administered periodically, after defects are noticed. The time we give to now and the future is only ever approximate. That's weird but it's also entirely not weird. As Demetrios Matsakis, the Chief
Scientist of Time Services for the US Naval Observatory puts it, "we save lives and we end lives. We add time and we
can take time away, but in both cases we do so
without completely understanding exactly what life is, or what time is." Regardless, thank you for spending some
of yours with me... and as always, thanks for watching.

**Transcript**:
On September 1st, 1953, William Scoville used a hand crank
and a cheap drill saw to bore into a young man's skull,
cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube. But this wasn't a scene from a horror film
or a gruesome police report. Dr. Scoville was one of the most 
renowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the young man was Henry Molaison,
the famous patient known as "H.M.", whose case provided amazing insights
into how our brains work. As a boy, Henry had cracked 
his skull in an accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out
and losing control of bodily functions. After enduring years of frequent episodes,
and even dropping out of high school, the desperate young man 
had turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky surgeries. Partial lobotomies had been used
for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that
mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas. Having successfully used them
to reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove 
H.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system
that was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown. At first glance, 
the operation had succeeded. H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared,
with no change in personality, and his IQ even improved. But there was one problem: 
His memory was shot. Besides losing most of his memories
from the previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones,
forgetting what day it was, repeating comments,
and even eating multiple meals in a row. When Scoville informed another expert,
Wilder Penfield, of the results, he sent a Ph.D student named Brenda Milner
to study H.M. at his parents' home, where he now spent his days
doing odd chores, and watching classic movies
for the first time, over and over. What she discovered through
a series of tests and interviews didn't just contribute greatly
to the study of memory. It redefined what memory even meant. One of Milner's findings shed light
on the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form new memories,
he still retained information long enough from moment to moment
to finish a sentence or find the bathroom. When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to remember it 
for fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly. But only five minutes later,
he forgot the test had even taken place. Neuroscientists had though of memory
as monolithic, all of it essentially the same
and stored throughout the brain. Milner's results were not only the first
clue for the now familiar distinction between short-term and long-term memory, but show that each uses 
different brain regions. We now know that memory formation
involves several steps. After immediate sensory data is temporarily
transcribed by neurons in the cortex, it travels to the hippocampus, where special proteins work to strengthen 
the cortical synaptic connections. If the experience was strong enough, or we recall it periodically
in the first few days, the hippocampus then transfers the memory
back to the cortex for permanent storage. H.M.'s mind could form
the initial impressions, but without a hippocampus
to perform this memory consolidation, they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand. But this was not the 
only memory distinction Milner found. In a now famous experiment,
she asked H.M. to trace a third star in the narrow space between 
the outlines of two concentric ones while he could only see
his paper and pencil through a mirror. Like anyone else performing such 
an awkward task for the first time, he did horribly. But surprisingly, he improved over 
repeated trials, even though he had no memory
of previous attempts. His unconscious motor centers remembered
what the conscious mind had forgotten. What Milner had discovered was that the
declarative memory of names, dates and facts is different from the procedural memory
of riding a bicycle or signing your name. And we now know that procedural memory relies more on the basal ganglia 
and cerebellum, structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain. This distinction between "knowing that"
and "knowing how" has underpinned all memory research since. H.M. died at the age of 82 after
a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home. Over the years, he had been examined
by more than 100 neuroscientists, making his the most 
studied mind in history. Upon his death, his brain was
preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000
individual slices and photographed to form a digital map
down to the level of individual neurons, all in a live broadcast
watched by 400,000 people. Though H.M. spent most of his life
forgetting things, he and his contributions
to our understanding of memory will be remembered for 
generations to come.

**Transcript**:
On September 1st, 1953, William Scoville used a hand crank
and a cheap drill saw to bore into a young man's skull,
cutting away vital pieces of his brain and sucking them out through a metal tube. But this wasn't a scene from a horror film
or a gruesome police report. Dr. Scoville was one of the most 
renowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the young man was Henry Molaison,
the famous patient known as "H.M.", whose case provided amazing insights
into how our brains work. As a boy, Henry had cracked 
his skull in an accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out
and losing control of bodily functions. After enduring years of frequent episodes,
and even dropping out of high school, the desperate young man 
had turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky surgeries. Partial lobotomies had been used
for decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that
mental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas. Having successfully used them
to reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove 
H.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system
that was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown. At first glance, 
the operation had succeeded. H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared,
with no change in personality, and his IQ even improved. But there was one problem: 
His memory was shot. Besides losing most of his memories
from the previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones,
forgetting what day it was, repeating comments,
and even eating multiple meals in a row. When Scoville informed another expert,
Wilder Penfield, of the results, he sent a Ph.D student named Brenda Milner
to study H.M. at his parents' home, where he now spent his days
doing odd chores, and watching classic movies
for the first time, over and over. What she discovered through
a series of tests and interviews didn't just contribute greatly
to the study of memory. It redefined what memory even meant. One of Milner's findings shed light
on the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form new memories,
he still retained information long enough from moment to moment
to finish a sentence or find the bathroom. When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to remember it 
for fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly. But only five minutes later,
he forgot the test had even taken place. Neuroscientists had though of memory
as monolithic, all of it essentially the same
and stored throughout the brain. Milner's results were not only the first
clue for the now familiar distinction between short-term and long-term memory, but show that each uses 
different brain regions. We now know that memory formation
involves several steps. After immediate sensory data is temporarily
transcribed by neurons in the cortex, it travels to the hippocampus, where special proteins work to strengthen 
the cortical synaptic connections. If the experience was strong enough, or we recall it periodically
in the first few days, the hippocampus then transfers the memory
back to the cortex for permanent storage. H.M.'s mind could form
the initial impressions, but without a hippocampus
to perform this memory consolidation, they eroded, 
like messages scrawled in sand. But this was not the 
only memory distinction Milner found. In a now famous experiment,
she asked H.M. to trace a third star in the narrow space between 
the outlines of two concentric ones while he could only see
his paper and pencil through a mirror. Like anyone else performing such 
an awkward task for the first time, he did horribly. But surprisingly, he improved over 
repeated trials, even though he had no memory
of previous attempts. His unconscious motor centers remembered
what the conscious mind had forgotten. What Milner had discovered was that the
declarative memory of names, dates and facts is different from the procedural memory
of riding a bicycle or signing your name. And we now know that procedural memory relies more on the basal ganglia 
and cerebellum, structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain. This distinction between "knowing that"
and "knowing how" has underpinned all memory research since. H.M. died at the age of 82 after
a mostly peaceful life in a nursing home. Over the years, he had been examined
by more than 100 neuroscientists, making his the most 
studied mind in history. Upon his death, his brain was
preserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000
individual slices and photographed to form a digital map
down to the level of individual neurons, all in a live broadcast
watched by 400,000 people. Though H.M. spent most of his life
forgetting things, he and his contributions
to our understanding of memory will be remembered for 
generations to come.

**Transcript**:
Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop. And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things that build resilience by governing 
the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful, like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides. Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems
play together, creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 15, Ground Truth Question 2, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop. And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things that build resilience by governing 
the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful, like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides. Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems
play together, creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra.

Testing, testing, one, two, three. When your band is trying to perform,
feedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,
feedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,
the environment or social science, is a phenomenon called
mutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called 
a feedback loop. And the natural world is full 
of these mechanisms formed by the links between living 
and nonliving things that build resilience by governing 
the way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material
enriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,
providing moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,
the more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,
and so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force
in the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback
because it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies
a particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops
can also be harmful, like when removing a forest 
makes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter
and nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,
and leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes
or counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,
they reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will
soon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing 
the hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down
wavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and
allowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem
counterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear
scenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow
by killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other
unexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down
the insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the
insect population to rise, counteracting the effects of 
our pesticides. Note that each feedback is
the product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will
reverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the
effect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not 
of separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,
occurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations
can generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered 
cacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems
play together, creating regular patterns
just like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex
but harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks
keep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular
ecosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated 
by predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops
stabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,
with many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the 
turn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead
matter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,
with its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks
among both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their 
ecosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics
into a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up
after losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland
may also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into
a magnificent orchestra.

**Transcript**:
Consider throwing a ball
straight into the air. Can you predict the motion
of the ball after it leaves your hand? Sure, that's easy. The ball will move upward
until it gets to some highest point, then it will come back down
and land in your hand again. Of course, that's what happens, and you know this because you have
witnessed events like this countless times. You've been observing the physics
of everyday phenomena your entire life. But suppose we explore a question
about the physics of atoms, like what does the motion of an electron around the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom look like? Could we answer that question based on
our experience with everyday physics? Definietly not. Why? Because the physics that governs the
behavior of systems at such small scales is much different than the physics
of the macroscopic objects you see around you all the time. The everyday world you know and love behaves according to the laws 
of classical mechanics. But systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws 
of quantum mechanics. This quantum world turns out to be
a very strange place. An illustration of quantum strangeness
is given by a famous thought experiment: Schrödinger's cat. A physicist, who doesn't particularly 
like cats, puts a cat in a box, along with a bomb that has a 50% chance
of blowing up after the lid is closed. Until we reopen the lid,
there is no way of knowing whether the bomb exploded or not, and thus, no way of knowing
if the cat is alive or dead. In quantum physics,
we could say that before our observation the cat was in a superposition state. It was neither alive nor dead but
rather in a mixture of both possibilities, with a 50% chance for each. The same sort of thing happens
to physical systems at quantum scales, like an electron orbiting
in a hydrogen atom. The electron isn't really orbiting at all. It's sort of everywhere in space,
all at once, with more of a probability of being
at some places than others, and it's only after 
we measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is
at that moment. A lot like how we didn't know
whether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box. This brings us to the strange
and beautiful phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,
we have two cats in two different boxes. If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment
with this pair of cats, the outcome of the experiment
can be one of four possibilities. Either both cats will be alive,
or both will be dead, or one will be alive 
and the other dead, or vice versa. The system of both cats
is again in a superposition state, with each outcome having a 25% chance
rather than 50%. But here's the cool thing: quantum mechanics tells us
it's possible to erase the both cats alive and both cats dead
outcomes from the superposition state. In other words,
there can be a two cat system, such that the outcome will always be
one cat alive and the other cat dead. The technical term for this is that the
states of the cats are entangled. But there's something truly mindblowing
about quantum entanglement. If you prepare the system of two cats
in boxes in this entangled state, then move the boxes to opposite 
ends of the universe, the outcome of the experiment
will still always be the same. One cat will always come out alive,
and the other cat will always end up dead, even though which particular cat
lives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome. How is this possible? How is it that the states of cats
on opposite sides of the universe can be entangled in this way? They're too far away to communicate
with each other in time, so how do the two bombs always 
conspire such that one blows up and the other doesn't? You might be thinking, "This is just some theoretical
mumbo jumbo. This sort of thing can't happen
in the real world." But it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed in 
real world lab experiments. Two subatomic particles entangled
in a superposition state, where if one spins one way
then the other must spin the other way, will do just that,
even when there's no way for information to pass
from one particle to the other indicating which way to spin
to obey the rules of entanglement. It's not surprising then that
entanglement is at the core of quantum information science, a growing field studying how to use
the laws of the strange quantum world in our macroscopic world, like in quantum cryptography, so spies
can send secure messages to each other, or quantum computing,
for cracking secret codes. Everyday physics may start to look
a bit more like the strange quantum world. Quantum teleportation 
may even progress so far, that one day your cat will 
escape to a safer galaxy, where there are no physicists
and no boxes.

**Transcript**:
Consider throwing a ball
straight into the air. Can you predict the motion
of the ball after it leaves your hand? Sure, that's easy. The ball will move upward
until it gets to some highest point, then it will come back down
and land in your hand again. Of course, that's what happens, and you know this because you have
witnessed events like this countless times. You've been observing the physics
of everyday phenomena your entire life. But suppose we explore a question
about the physics of atoms, like what does the motion of an electron around the nucleus of a 
hydrogen atom look like? Could we answer that question based on
our experience with everyday physics? Definietly not. Why? Because the physics that governs the
behavior of systems at such small scales is much different than the physics
of the macroscopic objects you see around you all the time. The everyday world you know and love behaves according to the laws 
of classical mechanics. But systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws 
of quantum mechanics. This quantum world turns out to be
a very strange place. An illustration of quantum strangeness
is given by a famous thought experiment: Schrödinger's cat. A physicist, who doesn't particularly 
like cats, puts a cat in a box, along with a bomb that has a 50% chance
of blowing up after the lid is closed. Until we reopen the lid,
there is no way of knowing whether the bomb exploded or not, and thus, no way of knowing
if the cat is alive or dead. In quantum physics,
we could say that before our observation the cat was in a superposition state. It was neither alive nor dead but
rather in a mixture of both possibilities, with a 50% chance for each. The same sort of thing happens
to physical systems at quantum scales, like an electron orbiting
in a hydrogen atom. The electron isn't really orbiting at all. It's sort of everywhere in space,
all at once, with more of a probability of being
at some places than others, and it's only after 
we measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is
at that moment. A lot like how we didn't know
whether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box. This brings us to the strange
and beautiful phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,
we have two cats in two different boxes. If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment
with this pair of cats, the outcome of the experiment
can be one of four possibilities. Either both cats will be alive,
or both will be dead, or one will be alive 
and the other dead, or vice versa. The system of both cats
is again in a superposition state, with each outcome having a 25% chance
rather than 50%. But here's the cool thing: quantum mechanics tells us
it's possible to erase the both cats alive and both cats dead
outcomes from the superposition state. In other words,
there can be a two cat system, such that the outcome will always be
one cat alive and the other cat dead. The technical term for this is that the
states of the cats are entangled. But there's something truly mindblowing
about quantum entanglement. If you prepare the system of two cats
in boxes in this entangled state, then move the boxes to opposite 
ends of the universe, the outcome of the experiment
will still always be the same. One cat will always come out alive,
and the other cat will always end up dead, even though which particular cat
lives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome. How is this possible? How is it that the states of cats
on opposite sides of the universe can be entangled in this way? They're too far away to communicate
with each other in time, so how do the two bombs always 
conspire such that one blows up and the other doesn't? You might be thinking, "This is just some theoretical
mumbo jumbo. This sort of thing can't happen
in the real world." But it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed in 
real world lab experiments. Two subatomic particles entangled
in a superposition state, where if one spins one way
then the other must spin the other way, will do just that,
even when there's no way for information to pass
from one particle to the other indicating which way to spin
to obey the rules of entanglement. It's not surprising then that
entanglement is at the core of quantum information science, a growing field studying how to use
the laws of the strange quantum world in our macroscopic world, like in quantum cryptography, so spies
can send secure messages to each other, or quantum computing,
for cracking secret codes. Everyday physics may start to look
a bit more like the strange quantum world. Quantum teleportation 
may even progress so far, that one day your cat will 
escape to a safer galaxy, where there are no physicists
and no boxes.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Well 'Let's Make a Deal' was a popular show back in the day; contestants could go on this game show and maybe go home with the car of their dreams. First of all the game show host was a very famous guy named Monty Hall. And Monty would come on to the show and he would have three doors. And a contestant, that's you, would come on to the show, Monty would give you the chance to choose door number 1, door number 2 or door number 3. Now behind one of those doors, only one, was your dream flash car. Bright red, sports car, very fast; it was awesome. And behind the other two doors were 'zonks', that was the 
'Let's Make a Deal' word for something that you don't really want. So you had- looks like a 1 in 3 chance of getting your dream car. So suppose you pick door number 1; and Monty would then do the same thing every week. He would go over to the two doors you didn't pick, 2 and 3, and he would open one of them. Let's suppose he opened door number 2. And the door that Monty opened would always have behind it a zonk. 
- (So- so he knew?) Well he knows everything right? He's the game show host. And then Monty looked at you in the face and say, 'do you like door number 1 or do you want to switch?' There's only one thing to switch to, in this case it's door number 3. Are you gonna stay with your choice, or are you gonna make that leap to something different? And very often contestants would stand there agonised, right? So they've got some new information- 
- (So stick or switch?) Stick or switch. Well, a remarkable thing about this problem, simple as it is, is that it has sparked just endless debate. In the time of the show I don't recall anybody ever saying there was a dedicated strategy that you should always follow, but in fact there is a dedicated strategy should follow: you should pick door number 3. That's the answer, you should switch. You should switch every time and that will do the best for you over the long run. So there is a 1/3 chance that the car is behind the door you picked initially, that means there must be a 2/3 chance, much greater twice as big, that the car is somewhere else. And since we know that somewhere else cannot be door number 2, because Monty showed us that, it's got to be over here. So this is what you should choose, you should switch. Twice as likely to have the car behind the door that you didn't pick as the door that you did. 2/3 probability to a 1/3 probability. Now if you switch are you guaranteed to win? Absolutely not. But if you play this game over and over again, on average, you will win 2/3 of the time so switch is your strategy and you can't beat it. One thing that you might say is that the initial 2/3 chance that the car was behind door number 2 and door number 3 got concentrated behind the door that Monty did not open. That's effectively what's happening, that's intuitively what's happening, and that in fact is what the mathematics shows is happening. Now there is a way to see that in kind of a more grand way; if we imagine not having three doors but we imagine having a hundred doors. And let's imagine that we're playing the same kind of game, we have Monty over here, he is going to give you an opportunity to pick a door and your dream flash car is behind one of these hundred doors but there are 99 zonks all behind the other doors. Now what is it that you're going to do? Well you're going to pick a door, say again you pick door number 1. Now you're feeling a little bit different than you might have felt in the case where there were three doors; because there you thought, wow I've got a 1 in 3 chance. Here you're thinking I've got a 1 in 100 chance,
I'm not gonna get that car. It's not behind door number 1, it's probably behind one of the other 99 doors. What Monty does is he opens 98 of those 99 doors, he shows you 98 zonks and he asked you now, do you want to switch? Well maybe just because of the sheer numbers this thing is a little clearer. You know that there was 99 out of a 100 chance that the car was over here and now the only door you're left with after Monty shows you all those zonks 
is door, say, number 37. And you're thinking, this is no good, this is no good, all those doors are no good; do I want to stay with 1 or do I want to stay with 37? You can sort of almost feel the concentration of that 99 percent going behind door number 37 and so you switch over here and very likely you're gonna get that car and drive away. (I like your car drawing.) Well thank you! (That makes more sense doesn't it? 
Suddenly it) (seems like a no-brainer.)
- It does seem like a no-brainer but in fact when it's on a smaller scale, maybe just because 1/3 and 2/3 are a whole lot closer to each other than 1 in 100 and 99 in a 100, that the the point is is obscured. [Preview] X and Y is the probability
of X given that Y happens, given that you know you open door number 2, what's the probability of the cars there, times the probability of Y happening by itself.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 18, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 3
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine if half the people
in your neighborhood, your city, or even your whole country were wiped out. It might sound like something
out of an apocalyptic horror film, but it actually happened 
in the 14th century during a disease outbreak
known as the Black Death. Spreading from China through Asia,
the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, the devastating epidemic destroyed 
as much as 1/5 of the world's population, killing nearly 50% of Europeans
in just four years. One of the most fascinating
and puzzling things abut the Black Death is that the illness itself
was not a new phenomenon but one that has affected
humans for centuries. DNA analysis of bone
and tooth samples from this period, as well as an earlier epidemic known
as the Plague of Justinian in 541 CE, has revealed that both were caused
by Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium that causes
bubonic plague today. What this means is that the same disease
caused by the same pathogen can behave and spread 
very differently throughout history. Even before the use of antibiotics,
the deadliest oubreaks in modern times, such as the ones that occurred
in early 20th century India, killed no more than 3% of the population. Modern instances of plague
also tend to remain localized, or travel slowly,
as they are spread by rodent fleas. But the medieval Black Death,
which spread like wildfire, was most likely communicated directly
from one person to another. And because genetic comparisons of ancient
to modern strains of Yersinia pestis have not revealed any significantly
functional genetic differences, the key to why the earlier outbreak
was so much deadlier must lie not in the parasite but the host. For about 300 years during
the High Middle Ages, a warmer climate
and agricultural improvements had led to explosive population growth
throughout Europe. But with so many new mouths to feed, the end of this warm period
spelled disaster. High fertility rates
combined with reduced harvest, meant the land could no longer 
support its population, while the abundant supply of labor
kept wages low. As a result, most Europeans
in the early 14th century experienced a steady decline
in living standards, marked by famine, poverty and poor health,
leaving them vulnerable to infection. And indeed, the skeletal remains
of Black Death victims found in London show telltale signs of 
malnutrition and prior illness. The destruction caused by the Black Death
changed humanity in two important ways. On a societal level,
the rapid loss of population led to important changes
in Europe’s economic conditions. With more food to go around, as well as more land and better pay
for the surviving farmers and workers, people began to eat better and live longer as studies of London cemeteries
have shown. Higher living standards also brought
an increase in social mobility, weakening feudalism and eventually
leading to political reforms. But the plague also had an important
biological impact. The sudden death of so many of
the most frail and vulnerable people left behind a population with
a significantly different gene pool, including genes that may have helped
survivors resist the disease. And because such mutations 
often confer immunities to multiple pathogens 
that work in similar ways, research to discover the genetic
consequences of the Black Death has the potential to be hugely beneficial. Today, the threat of an epidemic 
on the scale of the Black Death has been largely eliminated 
thanks to antibiotics. But the bubonic plague continues to kill a
few thousand people worldwide every year, and the recent emergence
of a drug-resistant strain threatens the return of darker times. Learning more about the causes and effects
of the Black Death is important, not just for understanding how
our world has been shaped by the past. It may also help save us from 
a similar nightmare in the future.

in the 14th century during a disease outbreak
known as the Black Death. Spreading from China through Asia,
the Middle East, Africa, and Europe, the devastating epidemic destroyed 
as much as 1/5 of the world's population, killing nearly 50% of Europeans
in just four years. One of the most fascinating
and puzzling things abut the Black Death is that the illness itself
was not a new phenomenon but one that has affected
humans for centuries. DNA analysis of bone
and tooth samples from this period, as well as an earlier epidemic known
as the Plague of Justinian in 541 CE, has revealed that both were caused
by Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium that causes
bubonic plague today. What this means is that the same disease
caused by the same pathogen can behave and spread 
very differently throughout history. Even before the use of antibiotics,
the deadliest oubreaks in modern times, such as the ones that occurred
in early 20th century India, killed no more than 3% of the population. Modern instances of plague
also tend to remain localized, or travel slowly,
as they are spread by rodent fleas. But the medieval Black Death,
which spread like wildfire, was most likely communicated directly
from one person to another. And because genetic comparisons of ancient
to modern strains of Yersinia pestis have not revealed any significantly
functional genetic differences, the key to why the earlier outbreak
was so much deadlier must lie not in the parasite but the host. For about 300 years during
the High Middle Ages, a warmer climate
and agricultural improvements had led to explosive population growth
throughout Europe. But with so many new mouths to feed, the end of this warm period
spelled disaster. High fertility rates
combined with reduced harvest, meant the land could no longer 
support its population, while the abundant supply of labor
kept wages low. As a result, most Europeans
in the early 14th century experienced a steady decline
in living standards, marked by famine, poverty and poor health,
leaving them vulnerable to infection. And indeed, the skeletal remains
of Black Death victims found in London show telltale signs of 
malnutrition and prior illness. The destruction caused by the Black Death
changed humanity in two important ways. On a societal level,
the rapid loss of population led to important changes
in Europe’s economic conditions. With more food to go around, as well as more land and better pay
for the surviving farmers and workers, people began to eat better and live longer as studies of London cemeteries
have shown. Higher living standards also brought
an increase in social mobility, weakening feudalism and eventually
leading to political reforms. But the plague also had an important
biological impact. The sudden death of so many of
the most frail and vulnerable people left behind a population with
a significantly different gene pool, including genes that may have helped
survivors resist the disease. And because such mutations 
often confer immunities to multiple pathogens 
that work in similar ways, research to discover the genetic
consequences of the Black Death has the potential to be hugely beneficial. Today, the threat of an epidemic 
on the scale of the Black Death has been largely eliminated 
thanks to antibiotics. But the bubonic plague continues to kill a
few thousand people worldwide every year, and the recent emergence
of a drug-resistant strain threatens the return of darker times. Learning more about the causes and effects
of the Black Death is important, not just for understanding how
our world has been shaped by the past. It may also help save us from 
a similar nightmare in the future.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Check this out: Here's a grid, nothing special,
just a basic grid, very grid-y. But look closer, 
into this white spot at the center where the two central vertical
and horizontal lines intersect. Look very closely.
Notice anything funny about this spot? Yeah, nothing. But keep looking.
Get weird and stare at it. Now, keeping your gaze
fixed on this white spot, check what's happening
in your peripheral vision. The other spots, are they still white?
Or do they show weird flashes of grey? Now look at this pan for baking muffins. Oh, sorry, one of the cups is inverted.
It pops up instead of dipping down. Wait, no spin the pan.
The other five are domed now? Whichever it is, this pan's defective. Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln,
and here's one upside down. Nothing weird going on here. Wait, turn that upside down one right side up.
What have they done to Abe? Those are just three optical illusions,
images that seem to trick us. How do they work? Are magical things happening
in the images themselves? While we could certainly be
sneaking flashes of grey into the peripheral white spots
of our animated grid, first off, we promise we aren't. You'll see the same effect with a grid
printed on a plain old piece of paper. In reality, this grid really is just a grid.
But not to your brain's visual system. Here's how it interprets the light
information you call this grid. The white intersections are surrounded by 
relatively more white on all four sides than any white point along a line segment. Your retinal ganglion cells notice that
there is more white around the intersections because they are organized to
increase contrast with lateral inhibition. Better contrast means it's easier
to see the edge of something. And things are what your eyes
and brain have evolved to see. Your retinal ganglion cells don't
respond as much at the crossings because there is more lateral inhibition
for more white spots nearby compared to the lines, 
which are surrounded by black. This isn't just a defect in your eyes; if you can see, then optical illusions
can trick you with your glasses on or with this paper or
computer screen right up in your face. What optical illusions show us is the way your photo receptors and brain
assemble visual information into the three-dimensional world
you see around you, where edges should get extra attention because things with edges
can help you or kill you. Look at that muffin pan again.
You know what causes confusion here? Your brain's visual cortex operates on
assumptions about the lighting of this image. It expects light to come from
a single source, shining down from above. And so these shading patterns could only
have been caused by light shining down on the sloping sides of a dome,
or the bottom of a hole. If we carefully recreate these clues
by drawing shading patterns, even on a flat piece of paper, our brain reflexively creates
the 3D concave or convex shape. Now for that creepy Lincoln
upside down face. Faces trigger activity
in areas of the brain that have specifically evolved
to help us recognize faces. Like the fusiform face area and others
in the occipital and temporal lobes. It makes sense, too,
we're very social animals with highly complex ways of
interacting with each other. When we see faces,
we have to recognize they are faces and figure out what
they're expressing very quickly. And what we focus on most
are the eyes and mouth. That's how we figure out if someone
is mad at us or wants to be our friend. In the upside down Lincoln face, the eyes and mouth were
actually right side up, so you didn't notice anything was off. But when we flipped the whole image over,
the most important parts of the face, the eyes and mouth, were now upside down,
and you realized something fishy was up. You realized your brain had taken
a short cut and missed something. But your brain wasn't really being lazy,
it's just very busy. So it spends cognitive energy
as efficiently as possible, using assumptions about visual information
to create a tailored, edited vision of the world. Imagine your brain
calling out these edits on the fly: "Okay, those squares could be objects. Let's enhance that black-white contrast
on the sides with lateral inhibition. Darken those corners! Dark grey fading into light grey? Assume overhead sunlight
falling on a sloping curve. Next! Those eyes look like most eyes I've seen before,
nothing weird going on here." See? Our visual tricks have
