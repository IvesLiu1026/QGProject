**Transcript**:
In the late 13th century, Osman I 
established a small beylik, or principality, in what is now Turkey. In just a few generations, this beylik
outmaneuvered more powerful neighbors to become the vast Ottoman empire. What enabled its rapid rise? In Osman’s time, the Anatolian peninsula
was a patchwork of Turkic principalities sandwiched between a crumbling
Byzantine Empire and weakened Sultanate
of the Seljuk of Rum. Osman quickly expanded this territory through a mixture of strategic
political alliances and military conflicts 
with these neighbors, attracting mercenaries first
with the promise of booty, then later through his reputation 
for winning. Osman was the first in a line 
of Ottoman rulers distinguished by their political shrewdness. Often prioritizing political and military
utility over ethnic or religious affinity, they expanded their influence by fighting
along certain sides when needed, and fighting against them 
when the time was right. After Osman’s death his son Orhan established a sophisticated military
organization and tax collection system geared towards funding 
quick territorial expansion. The Ottomans’ first major expansion
was in the Balkans, in southeast Europe. The military employed a mixture
of Turkic warriors and Byzantine and other Balkan Christian converts. They captured thousands 
of young Christian boys from villages from across the Balkans, converted them to Islam, and trained
them to become the backbone of a fierce military elite force
known as the Janissaries. The captured enslaved boys could rise
to the high position of a vizier in the Ottoman government. Rulers of conquered areas were
also allowed, even encouraged, to convert to Islam and take positions
in the Ottoman government. Meanwhile, non-Muslims 
who belonged to Abrahamic religions were allowed religious freedom 
in exchange for a tax known as Jizye, among other strict conditions— for example, they were not allowed
to join the army. By the end of the 14th century, 
the Ottomans had conquered or subordinated most of the Anatolian beyliks 
as well as the Balkans. But in the first half of the 15th century, as Sultan Beyazit I focused
on Western expansion, the Central Asian ruler Timur attacked
from the east. He captured Beyazit and carted
him off in an iron cage, sparking a ten year struggle 
for succession that almost destroyed the Ottoman empire. Sultan Murad II turned this trend around, but fell short of one 
of his loftiest goals: capturing the Byzantine capital,
Constantinople. His son, Sultan Mehmed II, 
or Mehmed the Conqueror, vowed to succeed where his father
had failed. In preparation for the attack 
on Constantinople, he hired a Hungarian engineer 
to forge the largest cannon in the world, used Serbian miners to dig tunnels
under the walls of the city, and ordered his fleet of ships
to be carried overland, attacking the city 
from an unexpected direction. He laid siege to the city 
and in the spring of 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. It would become the Ottoman capital, 
known by its common Greek name, Istanbul, meaning “to the city.” By the time Mehmed II
conquered Constantinople, the city was a shadow of its former glory. Under Ottoman rule, 
it flourished once again. On an average day in Istanbul, you could
hear people speaking Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Arabic, Bulgarian,
Albanian, and Serbian. Architects like the famous Sinan
filled the city with splendid mosques and other buildings commissioned
by the sultans. Through Istanbul, the Otttomans brought
commodities like coffee to Europe. They entered a golden age 
of economic growth, territorial acquisition, 
art and architecture. They brought together craftspeople 
from across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia to create
a unique blend of cultural innovation. Iznik ceramics, for example, were made using techniques
from China’s Ming dynasty, reimagined with Ottoman motifs. The Ottomans would continue to expand, cementing their political influence
and lucrative trade routes. The empire lasted for more than 600 years 
and, at its peak, stretched from Hungary
to the Persian Gulf, from the Horn of Africa
to the Crimean Peninsula.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the options in Question 4 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, the question content and intent are similar. Question 4 asks about the tax imposed on non-Muslims who belonged to Abrahamic religions in exchange for religious freedom, which is related to the ground truth MCQ that asks about the religious communities allowed religious freedoms under Ottoman Islamic rule.

However, a more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the specific religious communities allowed religious freedoms, with options that include Jewish and Christian communities. Unfortunately, such a generated MCQ is not provided.

Therefore, based on the available options, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

organization and tax collection system geared towards funding 
quick territorial expansion. The Ottomans’ first major expansion
was in the Balkans, in southeast Europe. The military employed a mixture
of Turkic warriors and Byzantine and other Balkan Christian converts. They captured thousands 
of young Christian boys from villages from across the Balkans, converted them to Islam, and trained
them to become the backbone of a fierce military elite force
known as the Janissaries. The captured enslaved boys could rise
to the high position of a vizier in the Ottoman government. Rulers of conquered areas were
also allowed, even encouraged, to convert to Islam and take positions
in the Ottoman government. Meanwhile, non-Muslims 
who belonged to Abrahamic religions were allowed religious freedom 
in exchange for a tax known as Jizye, among other strict conditions— for example, they were not allowed
to join the army. By the end of the 14th century, 
the Ottomans had conquered or subordinated most of the Anatolian beyliks 
as well as the Balkans. But in the first half of the 15th century, as Sultan Beyazit I focused
on Western expansion, the Central Asian ruler Timur attacked
from the east. He captured Beyazit and carted
him off in an iron cage, sparking a ten year struggle 
for succession that almost destroyed the Ottoman empire. Sultan Murad II turned this trend around, but fell short of one 
of his loftiest goals: capturing the Byzantine capital,
Constantinople. His son, Sultan Mehmed II, 
or Mehmed the Conqueror, vowed to succeed where his father
had failed. In preparation for the attack 
on Constantinople, he hired a Hungarian engineer 
to forge the largest cannon in the world, used Serbian miners to dig tunnels
under the walls of the city, and ordered his fleet of ships
to be carried overland, attacking the city 
from an unexpected direction. He laid siege to the city 
and in the spring of 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. It would become the Ottoman capital, 
known by its common Greek name, Istanbul, meaning “to the city.” By the time Mehmed II
conquered Constantinople, the city was a shadow of its former glory. Under Ottoman rule, 
it flourished once again. On an average day in Istanbul, you could
hear people speaking Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Arabic, Bulgarian,
Albanian, and Serbian. Architects like the famous Sinan
filled the city with splendid mosques and other buildings commissioned
by the sultans. Through Istanbul, the Otttomans brought
commodities like coffee to Europe. They entered a golden age 
of economic growth, territorial acquisition, 
art and architecture. They brought together craftspeople 
from across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia to create
a unique blend of cultural innovation. Iznik ceramics, for example, were made using techniques
from China’s Ming dynasty, reimagined with Ottoman motifs. The Ottomans would continue to expand, cementing their political influence
and lucrative trade routes. The empire lasted for more than 600 years 
and, at its peak, stretched from Hungary
to the Persian Gulf, from the Horn of Africa
to the Crimean Peninsula.

**Transcript**:
Princess Savitri of the Madra Kingdom
was as benevolent, brilliant, and bright as the Sun God she was named for. Her grace was known throughout the land, and many powerful princes and wealthy
merchants flocked to her family’s palace to seek her hand in marriage. But upon witnessing her blinding splendor
in person, the men lost their nerve. Unimpressed with these suitors, the princess determined
to find a husband herself. Mounting her golden chariot, 
she travelled through rolling deserts, glittering cities 
and snow-capped mountains— rejecting many men along the way. Eventually, Savitri ventured 
deep into the jungle, where she met a young man 
chopping wood. His name was Satyavan, and like her,
he loved the tranquil forest— but the princess saw he was not at peace. After talking for hours, Satyavan told
her of his plight. His parents had once been wealthy rulers, until his father was blinded 
and overthrown in a violent coup. Now Satyavan worked tirelessly 
to support their meager new life. His determination and devotion
moved the princess. As they gazed into each other’s eyes,
she knew she’d finally found an equal. Savitri rushed home to tell
her father the good news, only to find him conversing with Narada a traveling sage and wisest messenger 
of the Gods. At first her father was thrilled
to learn of Satyavan, but Narada revealed a tragic prophecy:
her betrothed had only a year to live. Savitri’s blood ran cold. She’d waited so long to find her partner—
was she already doomed to lose him? The princess would not accept these terms. She swore before Narada, her family, and Savitr himself that she would
never marry another. Satyavan was her one true love,
and their fates were entwined forever. Moved by her powerful words, the sage told the princess to follow
an ancient spiritual regimen. With regular prayer, periods of fasting, and preparation of special
herbs and plants, she might be able to prolong
Satyavan’s life. After a simple wedding, the couple
returned to the jungle to live in keeping with the sage’s instructions. This modest existence was a far cry
from her lavish upbringing, but they were happy in each other’s
company. A year passed, and the fated day arrived. On their first anniversary, 
the sun grew horribly hot, and Satyavan’s brow began to burn, Savitri barely had time to drag 
him into the shade, before he grew still and cold. Through her tears, the princess
saw an immense figure on the horizon. This was Yamraj, the God of Death, come to escort Satyavan’s soul 
to the afterlife. But Savitri was not giving up yet. She followed the god for hours
in the beating sun. Yamraj thundered at the princess
to leave him in peace. But even as her feet bled and throat
burned, Savitri would not turn back. Eventually, Yamraj paused. He would grant her one wish 
as reward for her persistence, but she couldn’t ask
for her husband’s life. Without hesitating, Savitri asked the God 
to restore her father in-law’s sight. The wish was granted, and Yamraj rode on. But still Savitri’s footsteps
echoed behind him. Exasperated, the God granted
her a second wish. This time, she asked for Satyavan’s
kingdom to be restored. Again the wish was granted, and Yamraj began his descent 
into his subterranean kingdom. But when he glanced back, he was astounded to see 
the bedraggled princess stumbling along. He’d never seen such devotion to the dead, and he honored her dedication
with one final wish. Savitri wished to be the mother
of many children. The God agreed, and waved to dismiss her. But the princess only repeated the vow
she’d made one year earlier: her fate was forever entwined
with Satyavan. How could she bear many children,
if Yamraj would not return her husband? Hearing this clever question the god
relented, knowing he’d been beaten. With Yamraj’s blessing and respect,
Satyavan was returned to Savitri, and the two walked back 
to the land of the living, united in a love that not even
death could destroy.

**Transcript**:
Princess Savitri of the Madra Kingdom
was as benevolent, brilliant, and bright as the Sun God she was named for. Her grace was known throughout the land, and many powerful princes and wealthy
merchants flocked to her family’s palace to seek her hand in marriage. But upon witnessing her blinding splendor
in person, the men lost their nerve. Unimpressed with these suitors, the princess determined
to find a husband herself. Mounting her golden chariot, 
she travelled through rolling deserts, glittering cities 
and snow-capped mountains— rejecting many men along the way. Eventually, Savitri ventured 
deep into the jungle, where she met a young man 
chopping wood. His name was Satyavan, and like her,
he loved the tranquil forest— but the princess saw he was not at peace. After talking for hours, Satyavan told
her of his plight. His parents had once been wealthy rulers, until his father was blinded 
and overthrown in a violent coup. Now Satyavan worked tirelessly 
to support their meager new life. His determination and devotion
moved the princess. As they gazed into each other’s eyes,
she knew she’d finally found an equal. Savitri rushed home to tell
her father the good news, only to find him conversing with Narada a traveling sage and wisest messenger 
of the Gods. At first her father was thrilled
to learn of Satyavan, but Narada revealed a tragic prophecy:
her betrothed had only a year to live. Savitri’s blood ran cold. She’d waited so long to find her partner—
was she already doomed to lose him? The princess would not accept these terms. She swore before Narada, her family, and Savitr himself that she would
never marry another. Satyavan was her one true love,
and their fates were entwined forever. Moved by her powerful words, the sage told the princess to follow
an ancient spiritual regimen. With regular prayer, periods of fasting, and preparation of special
herbs and plants, she might be able to prolong
Satyavan’s life. After a simple wedding, the couple
returned to the jungle to live in keeping with the sage’s instructions. This modest existence was a far cry
from her lavish upbringing, but they were happy in each other’s
company. A year passed, and the fated day arrived. On their first anniversary, 
the sun grew horribly hot, and Satyavan’s brow began to burn, Savitri barely had time to drag 
him into the shade, before he grew still and cold. Through her tears, the princess
saw an immense figure on the horizon. This was Yamraj, the God of Death, come to escort Satyavan’s soul 
to the afterlife. But Savitri was not giving up yet. She followed the god for hours
in the beating sun. Yamraj thundered at the princess
to leave him in peace. But even as her feet bled and throat
burned, Savitri would not turn back. Eventually, Yamraj paused. He would grant her one wish 
as reward for her persistence, but she couldn’t ask
for her husband’s life. Without hesitating, Savitri asked the God 
to restore her father in-law’s sight. The wish was granted, and Yamraj rode on. But still Savitri’s footsteps
echoed behind him. Exasperated, the God granted
her a second wish. This time, she asked for Satyavan’s
kingdom to be restored. Again the wish was granted, and Yamraj began his descent 
into his subterranean kingdom. But when he glanced back, he was astounded to see 
the bedraggled princess stumbling along. He’d never seen such devotion to the dead, and he honored her dedication
with one final wish. Savitri wished to be the mother
of many children. The God agreed, and waved to dismiss her. But the princess only repeated the vow
she’d made one year earlier: her fate was forever entwined
with Satyavan. How could she bear many children,
if Yamraj would not return her husband? Hearing this clever question the god
relented, knowing he’d been beaten. With Yamraj’s blessing and respect,
Satyavan was returned to Savitri, and the two walked back 
to the land of the living, united in a love that not even
death could destroy.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Yamraj's role and his mode of transportation. While none of the generated MCQs directly ask about Yamraj's mode of transportation, Question 6 mentions Yamraj and Question 7-10 discuss interactions between Yamraj and Princess Savitri.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 6 is the most relevant to the ground truth MCQ, as it mentions Yamraj and his interaction with Princess Savitri. However, it does not ask about Yamraj's role or mode of transportation.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is closest to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 6. However, please note that it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
How many people does it take to make
a cup of coffee? For many of us, all it takes is a short
walk and a quick pour. But this simple staple is the result 
of a globe-spanning process whose cost and complexity are far greater
than you might imagine. It begins in a place like the remote
Colombian town of Pitalito. Here, family farms have clear cut 
local forests to make room for neat rows of Coffea trees. These shrub-like plants 
were first domesticated in Ethiopia and are now cultivated throughout
equatorial regions. Each shrub is filled with small berries
called "coffee cherries." Since fruits on the same branch 
can ripen at different times, they’re best picked by hand, but each farm has its own method
for processing the fruit. In Pitalito, harvesters toil 
from dawn to dusk at high altitudes, often picking over 25 kilograms per shift
for very low wages. The workers deliver their picked cherries
to the wet mill. This machine separates the seeds
from the fruit, and then sorts them by density. The heaviest, most flavorful seeds 
sink to the bottom of the mill, where they’re collected 
and taken to ferment in a tub of water for one or two days. Then, workers wash off the remaining fruit
and put the seeds out to dry. Some farms use machines for this process, but in Pitalito, seeds are spread
onto large mesh racks. Over the next three weeks, 
workers rake the seeds regularly to ensure they dry evenly. Once the coffee beans are dry, a truck takes them to a nearby mill
with several specialized machines. An air blower re-sorts the seeds 
by density, an assortment of sieves filter 
them by size, and an optical scanner sorts by color. At this point, professionals called
Q-graders select samples of beans to roast and brew. In a process called "cupping," 
they evaluate the coffee’s taste, aroma, and mouthfeel to determine its quality. These experts give the beans a grade,
and get them ready to ship. Workers load burlap sacks 
containing up to 70 kilograms of dried and sorted coffee beans
onto steel shipping containers, each able to carry 
up to 21 metric tons of coffee. From tropical ports, cargo ships 
crewed by over 25 people transport coffee around the world But no country imports more coffee
than the United States, with New York City alone consuming
millions of cups every day. After the long journey 
from Colombia to New Jersey, our coffee beans pass through customs. Once dockworkers unload the container, a fleet of eighteen-wheelers transport 
the coffee to a nearby warehouse, and then to a roastery. Here the beans go into a roasting machine,
stirred by a metallic arm and heated by a gas-powered fire. Nearby sensors monitor the coffee’s
moisture level, chemical stability, and temperature, while trained coffee
engineers manually adjust these levels throughout the twelve-minute
roasting cycle. This process releases oil within the seed, transforming the seeds into grindable,
brewable beans with a dark brown color and rich aroma. After roasting, workers pack the beans
into five-pound bags, which a fleet of vans deliver to cafes
and stores across the city. The coffee is now so close 
you can smell it, but it needs more help 
for the final stretch. Each coffee company has a head buyer who carefully selects beans 
from all over the world. Logistics teams manage 
bean delivery routes, and brave baristas across the city
serve this caffeinated elixir to scores of hurried customers. All in all, it takes hundreds of people
to get coffee to its intended destination— and that’s not counting everyone
maintaining the infrastructure that makes the journey possible. Many of these individuals work 
for low pay in dangerous conditions— and some aren’t paid at all. So while we might marvel at the global
network behind this commodity, let’s make sure we don’t value 
the final product more than the people who make it.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, as it also deals with the origin and characteristics of coffee plants.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar. This is because it also deals with the processing of coffee fruit, although it does not specifically ask about the term for the small berries that contain the coffee seed.

But if I really had to choose one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, here is the index of the most similar generated MCQ:

sink to the bottom of the mill, where they’re collected 
and taken to ferment in a tub of water for one or two days. Then, workers wash off the remaining fruit
and put the seeds out to dry. Some farms use machines for this process, but in Pitalito, seeds are spread
onto large mesh racks. Over the next three weeks, 
workers rake the seeds regularly to ensure they dry evenly. Once the coffee beans are dry, a truck takes them to a nearby mill
with several specialized machines. An air blower re-sorts the seeds 
by density, an assortment of sieves filter 
them by size, and an optical scanner sorts by color. At this point, professionals called
Q-graders select samples of beans to roast and brew. In a process called "cupping," 
they evaluate the coffee’s taste, aroma, and mouthfeel to determine its quality. These experts give the beans a grade,
and get them ready to ship. Workers load burlap sacks 
containing up to 70 kilograms of dried and sorted coffee beans
onto steel shipping containers, each able to carry 
up to 21 metric tons of coffee. From tropical ports, cargo ships 
crewed by over 25 people transport coffee around the world But no country imports more coffee
than the United States, with New York City alone consuming
millions of cups every day. After the long journey 
from Colombia to New Jersey, our coffee beans pass through customs. Once dockworkers unload the container, a fleet of eighteen-wheelers transport 
the coffee to a nearby warehouse, and then to a roastery. Here the beans go into a roasting machine,
stirred by a metallic arm and heated by a gas-powered fire. Nearby sensors monitor the coffee’s
moisture level, chemical stability, and temperature, while trained coffee
engineers manually adjust these levels throughout the twelve-minute
roasting cycle. This process releases oil within the seed, transforming the seeds into grindable,
brewable beans with a dark brown color and rich aroma. After roasting, workers pack the beans
into five-pound bags, which a fleet of vans deliver to cafes
and stores across the city. The coffee is now so close 
you can smell it, but it needs more help 
for the final stretch. Each coffee company has a head buyer who carefully selects beans 
from all over the world. Logistics teams manage 
bean delivery routes, and brave baristas across the city
serve this caffeinated elixir to scores of hurried customers. All in all, it takes hundreds of people
to get coffee to its intended destination— and that’s not counting everyone
maintaining the infrastructure that makes the journey possible. Many of these individuals work 
for low pay in dangerous conditions— and some aren’t paid at all. So while we might marvel at the global
network behind this commodity, let’s make sure we don’t value 
the final product more than the people who make it.

How many people does it take to make
a cup of coffee? For many of us, all it takes is a short
walk and a quick pour. But this simple staple is the result 
of a globe-spanning process whose cost and complexity are far greater
than you might imagine. It begins in a place like the remote
Colombian town of Pitalito. Here, family farms have clear cut 
local forests to make room for neat rows of Coffea trees. These shrub-like plants 
were first domesticated in Ethiopia and are now cultivated throughout
equatorial regions. Each shrub is filled with small berries
called "coffee cherries." Since fruits on the same branch 
can ripen at different times, they’re best picked by hand, but each farm has its own method
for processing the fruit. In Pitalito, harvesters toil 
from dawn to dusk at high altitudes, often picking over 25 kilograms per shift
for very low wages. The workers deliver their picked cherries
to the wet mill. This machine separates the seeds
from the fruit, and then sorts them by density. The heaviest, most flavorful seeds 
sink to the bottom of the mill, where they’re collected

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is about which country imports the most coffee. The correct answer is the United States. 

Among the generated MCQs, none directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 7 mentions the transportation of coffee from tropical ports to other countries and the number of people involved, which is somewhat related to the importation of coffee.

But a closer look reveals that Question 7 doesn't match the intent of the ground truth MCQ. However, it does provide some information about the importation process.

Upon re-examining the generated MCQs, it becomes clear that none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that a new MCQ could be generated to match the ground truth MCQ. 

If I had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but it's not a good match. A better approach would be to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I must provide an index, I would say that Question 7 is the closest, but with the caveat that it's not a good match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

Although Question 3 does not ask about the weight of burlap sacks, it does ask about a specific quantity mentioned in the transcript (the amount of coffee that can be picked by a harvester in one shift), which is similar to the intent of the ground truth MCQ. However, a more similar question would be one that asks about the weight of burlap sacks or a similar quantity.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks about the weight of burlap sacks or a similar quantity. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say Question 3 is the closest match based on the fact that it asks about a specific quantity mentioned in the transcript.

But after re-reading the generated MCQs, I noticed that Question 5 asks about the capacity of steel shipping containers, which is similar to the intent of the ground truth MCQ. 

So, the most similar generated MCQ is actually Question 5 or Question 3.

**Transcript**:
In 1942, a mother-daughter duo Katherine Cook Briggs
and Isabel Briggs Myers developed a questionnaire that classified
people’s personalities into 16 types. Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,
or MBTI, it would go on to become one of the world’s 
most widely-used personality tests. Today, personality testing 
is a multi-billion dollar industry used by individuals, schools,
and companies. But none of these tests, including 
the MBTI, the Big Five, the DiSC assessment, 
the Process Communication Model, and the Enneagram, actually reveal truths about personality. In fact, it’s up for debate 
whether personality is a stable, measurable feature 
of an individual at all. Part of the problem is the way the tests
are constructed. Each is based on a different set 
of metrics to define personality: the Myers-Briggs, for instance, focuses on features like introversion 
and extroversion to classify people into
personality "types," while the Big Five scores participants
on five different traits. Most are self-reported, meaning the results are based on questions
participants answer about themselves. So it’s easy to lie, but even with 
the best intentions, objective self-evaluation is tricky. Take this question from the Big Five: How would you rate the accuracy
of the statement "I am always prepared"? There’s a clear favorable answer here,
which makes it difficult to be objective. People subconsciously aim to please: when asked to agree or disagree,
we show a bias toward answering however we believe 
the person or institution asking the question wants us to answer. Here’s another question— what do you value more, 
justice or fairness? What about harmony or forgiveness? You may well value both sides 
of each pair, but the MBTI would force 
you to choose one. And while it’s tempting to assume 
the results of that forced choice must somehow reveal a true preference,
they don’t: When faced with the same forced choice
question multiple times, the same person will sometimes
change their answer. Given these design flaws, it’s no surprise
that test results can be inconsistent. One study found that nearly half of people
who take the Myers-Briggs a second time only five weeks after the first
get assigned a different type. And other studies on the Myers-Briggs have
found that people with very similar scores end up being placed 
in different categories, suggesting that the strict divisions
between personality types don’t reflect real-life nuances. Complicating matters further, the definitions of personality traits 
are constantly shifting. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who popularized the terms
introvert and extrovert, defined an introvert as someone who sticks
to their principles regardless of situation, and an extrovert as someone who molds
their self according to circumstance. Introversion later came to mean shyness,
while an extrovert was someone outgoing. Today, an introvert is someone who finds
alone time restorative, an extrovert draws energy 
from social interaction, and an ambivert falls somewhere
between these two extremes. The notion of an innate, 
unchanging personality forms the basis of all these tests. But research increasingly suggests that
personality shifts during key periods— like our school years,
or when we start working. Though certain features 
of a person’s behavior may remain relatively stable over time, others are malleable, moulded by our

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1942, a mother-daughter duo Katherine Cook Briggs
and Isabel Briggs Myers developed a questionnaire that classified
people’s personalities into 16 types. Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,
or MBTI, it would go on to become one of the world’s 
most widely-used personality tests. Today, personality testing 
is a multi-billion dollar industry used by individuals, schools,
and companies. But none of these tests, including 
the MBTI, the Big Five, the DiSC assessment, 
the Process Communication Model, and the Enneagram, actually reveal truths about personality. In fact, it’s up for debate 
whether personality is a stable, measurable feature 
of an individual at all. Part of the problem is the way the tests
are constructed. Each is based on a different set 
of metrics to define personality: the Myers-Briggs, for instance, focuses on features like introversion 
and extroversion to classify people into
personality "types," while the Big Five scores participants
on five different traits. Most are self-reported, meaning the results are based on questions
participants answer about themselves. So it’s easy to lie, but even with 
the best intentions, objective self-evaluation is tricky. Take this question from the Big Five: How would you rate the accuracy
of the statement "I am always prepared"? There’s a clear favorable answer here,
which makes it difficult to be objective. People subconsciously aim to please: when asked to agree or disagree,
we show a bias toward answering however we believe 
the person or institution asking the question wants us to answer. Here’s another question— what do you value more, 
justice or fairness? What about harmony or forgiveness? You may well value both sides 
of each pair, but the MBTI would force 
you to choose one. And while it’s tempting to assume 
the results of that forced choice must somehow reveal a true preference,
they don’t: When faced with the same forced choice
question multiple times, the same person will sometimes
change their answer. Given these design flaws, it’s no surprise
that test results can be inconsistent. One study found that nearly half of people
who take the Myers-Briggs a second time only five weeks after the first
get assigned a different type. And other studies on the Myers-Briggs have
found that people with very similar scores end up being placed 
in different categories, suggesting that the strict divisions
between personality types don’t reflect real-life nuances. Complicating matters further, the definitions of personality traits 
are constantly shifting. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who popularized the terms
introvert and extrovert, defined an introvert as someone who sticks
to their principles regardless of situation, and an extrovert as someone who molds
their self according to circumstance. Introversion later came to mean shyness,
while an extrovert was someone outgoing. Today, an introvert is someone who finds
alone time restorative, an extrovert draws energy 
from social interaction, and an ambivert falls somewhere
between these two extremes. The notion of an innate, 
unchanging personality forms the basis of all these tests. But research increasingly suggests that
personality shifts during key periods— like our school years,
or when we start working. Though certain features 
of a person’s behavior may remain relatively stable over time, others are malleable, moulded by our
upbringing, life experiences, and age. All of this matters more or less depending
on how a personality test is used. Though anyone using them should take
the results with a grain of salt, there isn’t much harm in individual use— and users may even learn some 
new terms and concepts in the process. But the use of personality tests extends

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of people who get a different answer when taking the Myers-Briggs test a second time. While none of the generated MCQs ask this exact question, Question 4 mentions "inconsistent results" as a common design flaw in personality tests, which is related to the idea of people getting different answers when taking the test multiple times.

However, a closer match is not available. If I had to choose, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match, but it's still not very similar.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ. 

If I had to choose an index, I would say: Question 4 (Index: 4)

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and it's recommended to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ.

will perform in a specific role. So by using personality tests this way, institutions can deprive people 
of opportunities they’d excel at, or discourage them from considering 
certain paths.

**Transcript**:
It was about two years
after Hurricane Katrina that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps. These flood maps are used
to show land loss in the past and land loss that is to come. On this particular day,
at a community meeting, these maps were used to explain how a 30-foot tidal surge
that accompanied Hurricane Katrina could flood communities like mine
in south Louisiana and communities across
the Mississippi and Alabama coast. It turns out that the land we were losing
was our buffer from the sea. I volunteered to interact
with the graphics on the wall, and in an instant my life changed
for the second time in two years. The graphic showed
massive land loss in south Louisiana and an encroaching sea, but more specifically, the graphic showed
the disappearance of my community and many other communities
before the end of the century. I wasn't alone at the front of the room. I was standing there with other members
of south Louisiana's communities -- black, Native, poor. We thought we were just bound
by temporary disaster recovery, but we found that we were now bound
by the impossible task of ensuring that our communities
would not be erased by sea level rise due to climate change. Friends, neighbors, family, my community: I just assumed it would always be there. Land, trees, marsh, bayous: I just assumed that it would be there
as it had been for thousands of years. I was wrong. To understand what was happening
to my community, I had to talk to other communities
around the globe. I started in south Louisiana
with the United Houma Nation. I talked to youth advocates
in Shishmaref, Alaska. I talked to fisherwomen
in coastal Vietnam, justice fighters in Fiji, new generations of leaders in the ancient cultures
of the Torres Straits. Communities that had been here
for thousands of years were suffering the same fate, and we were all contemplating
how we would survive the next 50. By the end of the next century, it's predicted that
more than 180 million people will be displaced due to climate change, and in south Louisiana, those who can afford to do so
are already moving. They're moving because
south Louisiana is losing land at one of the fastest rates on the planet. Disappearance is what my bayou community has in common with
other coastal communities. Erasure is what communities
around the globe are fighting as we get real about
the impacts of climate change. I've spent the last 14 years
advocating on behalf of communities that have been directly impacted
by the climate crisis. These communities
are fighting discrimination within climate disaster recovery, and they're also trying to balance
mass displacement of people with an influx of others who see opportunity in starting anew. Since 2005, people
have been called "refugees" when they leave when they're displaced
by climate disaster, even when they don't cross
international borders. These terms, these misused terms, that are meant to identify the other, the victim, the person who is not supposed to be here, these terms are barriers to economic recovery, to social integration and to the healing required from
the climate crisis and climate trauma. Words matter. It also matters how we treat
people who are crossing borders. We should care about how people
who are crossing borders today to seek refuge and safety
are being treated, if for no other reason than it might
be you or someone you love who needs to exercise
their human right to migrate in the nearby future. We must start preparing
for global migration today. It's a reality now. Our cities and our communities
are not prepared. In fact, our economic system
and our social systems are only prepared to make profit
off of people who migrate. This will cause rounds
of climate gentrification, and it will also penalize
the movement of people, usually through exploited labor and usually through criminalization. Climate gentrification that happens
in anticipation of sea level rise is what we're seeing in places like Miami, where communities
that were kept from the waterfront are now being priced out
of the high ground where they were placed originally as people move away from the coast. These folks are being moved,
forced to relocate away from the social and economic systems
that they need to survive. Climate gentrification also happens
in the aftermath of climate disaster. When massive amounts
of people leave a location for an indefinite amount of time, we see others come in. We also see climate gentrification happen when damaged homes are now "green built," but now have a higher value, generally outside of the reach
of black and brown and poor people who want to return home. The price difference in rents
or the ownership of a house is the difference between
being able to practice your right, your human right
to return home as a community, or be forced to resettle somewhere else less climate resilient, less expensive and alone. The climate crisis
is a much larger conversation than reducing CO2 emissions, and it is a much different conversation
than just extreme weather. We're facing a shift
in every aspect of our global reality. And climate migration
is just one small part, but it's going to have ripple effects in both coastal cities
and cities in the interior. So what do we do? I have a few ideas. (Laughter) First, we must reframe
our understanding of the problem. Climate change is not the problem. Climate change
is the most horrible symptom of an economic system that has been built for a few to extract every precious value
out of this planet and its people, from our natural resources to the fruits of our human labor. This system has created this crisis. (Applause) We must have the courage
to admit we've taken too much. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the entire world is paying a price for the privilege and comfort
of just a few people on the planet. It's time for us to make
society-wide changes to a system that incentivizes consumption to the point of global imbalance. Our social, political and economic
systems of extraction must be transformed into systems
that regenerate the earth and advance human liberty globally. It is arrogance to think
that technology will save us. It is ego to think that we can continue this unjust and extractive approach
to living on this planet and survive. (Applause) To survive this next phase
of our human existence, we will need to restructure
our social and economic systems to develop our collective resilience. The social restructuring must be
towards restoration and repair of the earth and the communities
that have been extracted from, criminalized and targeted for generations. These are the frontlines. This is where we start. We must establish a new social attitude
to see migration as a benefit, a necessity for our global survival, not as a threat
to our individual privilege. Collective resilience means developing
cities that can receive people and provide housing, food, water, health care and the freedom from overpolicing for everyone, no matter who they are, no matter where they're from. What would it mean if we started
to plan for climate migration now? Sprawling cities or declining cities
could see this as an opportunity to rebuild a social infrastructure
rooted in justice and fairness. We could actually put money
into public hospitals and help them prepare for what is to come
through climate migration, including the trauma
that comes with loss and relocation. We can invest more of our time in justice, but it cannot be for temporary gain, it cannot be to help budget shortfalls, it has to be for long-term change and it has to be to advance justice. It's already possible, y'all. After Hurricane Katrina, universities and high schools
around the US took in students to help them finish their semester
or their year without missing a beat. Those students are now
productive assets in our community, and this is what our communities,
our businesses and our institutions need to get ready for now. The time is now. So as we reframe the problem
in a more truthful way and we restructure our social systems
in a more just way, all that will be left is for us
to reindigenize ourselves and to conjure a power
of the most ancient kind. This necessarily means
that we must learn to follow -- not tokenize, not exotify, not dismiss -- the leadership and
the traditional knowledge of a particular local place. It means that we must commit
to standards of ecological equity and climate justice and human rights as the basis, a base standard, a starting point, for where our new society is to go. All of this requires us to recognize
a power greater than ourselves and a life longer
than the ones we will live. It requires us to believe in the things
that we are privileged enough not to have to see. We must honor the rights of nature. We must advance human rights for all. We must transform from a disposable, individual society into one that sees our collective,
long-term humanity, or else we will not make it. We must see that even the best of us
are entangled in an unjust system, and we must acknowledge that the only way you're going to survive is for us to figure out how to reach a shared liberation together. The good news is we come from powerful people. We come from those who have,
in one way or another, survived so far to be us here today. This is reason enough to fight. And take it from
your south Louisiana friend, those hardest fights
are the ones to celebrate. Let's choose to make this next phase
of our planetary existence beautiful, and while we're at it, let's make it just and fair for everyone. We can do this, y'all. We can do this, because we must. We must, or else we lose our planet and we lose ourselves. The work starts here. The work starts together. This is my offering. Thank you for receiving it. Merci. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In 2018, a single power plant 
produced more energy than the world’s largest coal-powered
and gas-powered plants combined. And rather than using finite fossil fuels, this massively powerful plant relied on
a time-tested source of renewable energy: running water. Stretching over 2.3 kilometers, China’s Three Gorges Dam isn’t just 
the world’s largest hydroelectric plant. It’s capable of producing more energy
than any other power plant on Earth. So what allows Three Gorges 
to generate all this power? And how do hydroelectric plants
work in the first place? A hydroelectric dam is essentially 
a massive gate, which redirects a river’s natural flow
through a large pipe called a penstock. Rushing water flows through the penstock
and turns the blades of a turbine, which is attached to a generator
in an adjacent power station. The turning of the blades spins coils
of wire inside a magnetic field, producing a steady supply of electricity. Because the penstocks can be sealed
at any time, a dam can hold back excess water
during stormy seasons, and save it for dry ones. This allows hydroelectric dams 
to produce power regardless of the weather, while simultaneously preventing
floods further downstream. These benefits have long appealed 
to China’s Hubei Province. Located near the basin
of the Yangtze River, this region is prone to deadly floods
during rainy seasons when the Yangtze’s flow is strongest. Plans to build a dam that would
transform this volatile waterway into a stable source of power circulated
throughout the 20th century. When construction finally began in 1994
the plans were epic. The dam would contain 32 turbines—
12 more than the previous record holder, South America’s Itaipu Dam. The turbines would supply energy 
to two separate power stations, each connecting to a series of cables
spanning hundreds of kilometers. Electricity from Three Gorges would
reach power grids as far away as Shanghai. However, the human costs 
of this ambition were steep. To create the dam’s reservoir, workers needed to flood over 
600 square kilometers of land upstream. This area included 13 cities, 
hundreds of villages, and over 1,000 historical
and archaeological sites. The construction displaced roughly
1.4 million people, and the government’s relocation programs
were widely considered insufficient. Many argued against this controversial
construction, but others estimated that the lives
saved by the dam’s flood protection would outweigh the trauma 
of displacement. Furthermore, raising the water level
upstream would improve the river’s navigability, increase shipping capacity,
and transform the region into a collection 
of prosperous port towns. When the project was completed in 2012, China became the world’s largest
producer of electricity. In 2018, the dam generated 101.6 billion
kilowatt-hours. That’s enough electricity to power 
nearly 2% of China for one year; or to power New York City 
for almost two years. This is a truly astonishing amount
of energy. And yet, two years earlier, 
another dam less than half the size actually generated more electricity. Despite Three Gorges record-setting scale,
the Itaipu Dam still produced more power. To understand why Itaipu can outperform
Three Gorges, we need to look at the two factors
that determine a dam’s energy output. The first is the number of turbines. Three Gorges has the world’s highest
installed turbine capacity, meaning it’s theoretically capable 
of producing over 50% more power than Itaipu. But the second factor is the force 
and frequency of water moving through those turbines. Three Gorges spans several deep, narrow
ravines surging with powerful water. However, the Yangtze’s seasonal changes
keep the dam from reaching its theoretical maximum output. The Itaipu Dam, on the other hand, is located atop what was previously
the planet’s largest waterfall by volume. Although the dam’s construction destroyed
this natural wonder, the constant flow of water allows Itaipu to consistently generate more
power each year. This dam rivalry is far from over, and other projects like the Inga Falls Dam
in the Democratic Republic of Congo are also vying for the title 
of most powerful power plant. But whatever the future holds,
governments will need to ensure that a power plant’s environmental
and human impact are as sustainable as the energy
it produces.

**Transcript**:
In 2018, a single power plant 
produced more energy than the world’s largest coal-powered
and gas-powered plants combined. And rather than using finite fossil fuels, this massively powerful plant relied on
a time-tested source of renewable energy: running water. Stretching over 2.3 kilometers, China’s Three Gorges Dam isn’t just 
the world’s largest hydroelectric plant. It’s capable of producing more energy
than any other power plant on Earth. So what allows Three Gorges 
to generate all this power? And how do hydroelectric plants
work in the first place? A hydroelectric dam is essentially 
a massive gate, which redirects a river’s natural flow
through a large pipe called a penstock. Rushing water flows through the penstock
and turns the blades of a turbine, which is attached to a generator
in an adjacent power station. The turning of the blades spins coils
of wire inside a magnetic field, producing a steady supply of electricity. Because the penstocks can be sealed
at any time, a dam can hold back excess water
during stormy seasons, and save it for dry ones. This allows hydroelectric dams 
to produce power regardless of the weather, while simultaneously preventing
floods further downstream. These benefits have long appealed 
to China’s Hubei Province. Located near the basin
of the Yangtze River, this region is prone to deadly floods
during rainy seasons when the Yangtze’s flow is strongest. Plans to build a dam that would
transform this volatile waterway into a stable source of power circulated
throughout the 20th century. When construction finally began in 1994
the plans were epic. The dam would contain 32 turbines—
12 more than the previous record holder, South America’s Itaipu Dam. The turbines would supply energy 
to two separate power stations, each connecting to a series of cables
spanning hundreds of kilometers. Electricity from Three Gorges would
reach power grids as far away as Shanghai. However, the human costs 
of this ambition were steep. To create the dam’s reservoir, workers needed to flood over 
600 square kilometers of land upstream. This area included 13 cities, 
hundreds of villages, and over 1,000 historical
and archaeological sites. The construction displaced roughly
1.4 million people, and the government’s relocation programs
were widely considered insufficient. Many argued against this controversial
construction, but others estimated that the lives
saved by the dam’s flood protection would outweigh the trauma 
of displacement. Furthermore, raising the water level
upstream would improve the river’s navigability, increase shipping capacity,
and transform the region into a collection 
of prosperous port towns. When the project was completed in 2012, China became the world’s largest
producer of electricity. In 2018, the dam generated 101.6 billion
kilowatt-hours. That’s enough electricity to power 
nearly 2% of China for one year; or to power New York City 
for almost two years. This is a truly astonishing amount
of energy. And yet, two years earlier, 
another dam less than half the size actually generated more electricity. Despite Three Gorges record-setting scale,
the Itaipu Dam still produced more power. To understand why Itaipu can outperform
Three Gorges, we need to look at the two factors
that determine a dam’s energy output. The first is the number of turbines. Three Gorges has the world’s highest
installed turbine capacity, meaning it’s theoretically capable 
of producing over 50% more power than Itaipu. But the second factor is the force 
and frequency of water moving through those turbines. Three Gorges spans several deep, narrow
ravines surging with powerful water. However, the Yangtze’s seasonal changes
keep the dam from reaching its theoretical maximum output. The Itaipu Dam, on the other hand, is located atop what was previously
the planet’s largest waterfall by volume. Although the dam’s construction destroyed
this natural wonder, the constant flow of water allows Itaipu to consistently generate more
power each year. This dam rivalry is far from over, and other projects like the Inga Falls Dam
in the Democratic Republic of Congo are also vying for the title 
of most powerful power plant. But whatever the future holds,
governments will need to ensure that a power plant’s environmental
and human impact are as sustainable as the energy
it produces.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of dam the Three Gorges Dam is, while the generated MCQs cover various aspects of the Three Gorges Dam and hydroelectric plants in general.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the topic and content, I would select Question 1: "What is the name of the world's largest hydroelectric plant?" Although this question does not ask about the type of dam, it is related to the Three Gorges Dam and provides some information about it.

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that directly address the type of dam the Three Gorges Dam is, to ensure a closer match with the ground truth MCQ.

That being said, if I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have
unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive
about politics or religion, childcare, food? (Laughter) And how many of you
know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want
to talk to them? (Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order
to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice
of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change
and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- (Laughter) are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential
to devolve into an argument, where our politicians
can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately
for it and against it, it's not normal. Pew Research did a study
of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment,
we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're
not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even
who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means
we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance
between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way,
we lost that balance. Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all
either have in your hands or close enough that you could
grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers
send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them,
are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk
to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher
named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids
a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak
on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: “I came to realize...” (Laughter) "I came to realize
that conversational competence might be the single
most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging
with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal
communications skills. It might sound like a funny question,
but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain
coherent, confident conversation?" Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like.
I talk to people that I don’t like. I talk to some people that I disagree with
deeply on a personal level. But I still have
a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. Many of you have already heard
a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics
to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show
that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard
or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap. (Laughter) There is no reason to learn
how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I actually use the exact
same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you
how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you
learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time,
without getting bored, and, please God,
without offending anybody. We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before.
We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you
walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel
like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions
can't be like that. So I have 10 basic rules.
I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose
one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations. Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean
just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys
or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument
you had with your boss. Don't think about what
you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out
of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it
and half out of it. Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response
or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog. (Laughter) Now, there's a really good reason
why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to
hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations
and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation
assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires
a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means
setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become
less and less vulnerable and more and more likely
to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have
something to learn. Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet
knows something that you don't." I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something. Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who,
what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question,
you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" you're going to respond to the most
powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is
"Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." Let them describe it.
They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like,
"What was that like?" "How did that feel?" Because then they might have to stop
for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get
a much more interesting response. Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts
will come into your mind and you need to let them
go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking
for several minutes and then the host comes back in
and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere,
or it's already been answered. That means the host probably
stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought
of this really clever question, and he was just bound
and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having
a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time
that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. (Laughter) And we stop listening. Stories and ideas
are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. Number five: If you don't know,
say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio,
especially on NPR, are much more aware
that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful
about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap. Number six: Don't equate
your experience with theirs. If they're talking
about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time
you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble
they're having at work, don't tell them about
how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly,
it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment
to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once
what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag
about their IQs are losers." (Laughter) Conversations are not
a promotional opportunity. Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending,
and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations
or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it
over and over. Don't do that. Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling
to come up with in your mind. They don't care.
What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. Number nine: This is not the last one,
but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many
really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most,
the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open,
you're not learning." And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man
ever listened his way out of a job." (Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything
I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks
at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to
500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in
those other 275 words. And look, I know,
it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that,
you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out
barely related sentences in the same place. (Laughter) You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen
with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply." One more rule, number 10,
and it’s this one: Be brief. Be interested in other people. You know, I grew up
with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual 
in my home. People would come over
to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave,
my mother would come over to us, and she’d say, 
“Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize.
He's a Russian ballet dancer." And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden,
amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think
it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut
as often as I possibly can. I keep my mind open. And I’m always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly,
be prepared to be amazed. Thanks. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Baldur— son of All Father Odin 
and Queen Frigg, husband of Nanna the Peaceful, 
and God of truth and light— was the gentlest and most beloved being 
in all of Asgard. In his great hall of Breidablik, Baldur’s soothing presence 
eased his subject’s woes. But lately, he was plagued 
by troubles of his own. Every night, Baldur had gruesome visions 
foretelling his own imminent death. Determined to protect her son 
from these grim prophecies, Queen Frigg travelled 
across the nine realms, begging all living things 
not to harm Baldur. Her grace moved each being 
she encountered. Every animal and element, every plague 
and plant, every blade and bug gladly gave their word. Frigg returned to Breidablik, 
and threw a great feast to celebrate. Wine flowed freely, and soon the gods 
took turns testing Baldur’s immunity. Lurking in the corner, 
Loki rolled his eyes. The trickster god had never cared 
for Baldur the Bright, and found his new gift 
profoundly irritating. Surely there was a flaw in Frigg’s plan. Taking the form of an old woman, Loki crept to Frigg’s side 
and feigned confusion. Why were the gods attacking sweet Baldur, 
whom they all loved so dearly? Frigg told her of the oaths, 
but the old woman pressed on. Surely you didn’t receive a vow 
from everything, she asked. Frigg shrugged. The only being she hadn’t visited 
was mistletoe. After all, what god could fear 
a trifling weed? At this, Loki dashed outside 
to find a sprig of mistletoe. When he returned, the festivities 
had grown even rowdier. But not every god was enjoying the party. Baldur’s brother Hodur, who was blind 
and weapon-less, sat dejected. Seeing his opportunity, the trickster slyly offered 
Hodur a chance to participate. Loki armed him with mistletoe, 
guided his aim towards his brother, and told Hodur to hurl with all his might. The mistletoe pierced Baldur’s chest 
with deadly force. The god’s light quickly flickered out, 
and despair swept over the crowd. Within moments, the impact 
of Baldur’s death could be felt across the nine realms. But from the weeping masses, 
Hermod the Brave stepped forward. The warrior god believed that with 
the help of Odin’s mighty steed, there was no plane he could not reach. He would travel to halls of Hel herself, 
and bring Baldur home. The god rode for nine days 
and nine nights, past halls of corpses 
and over paths paved with bone. When he finally reached 
the Queen of the Underworld, Hermod begged her to return 
Baldur to his family. Hel considered taking pity, but she wanted
to know the extent of the gods’ mourning. She agreed to relinquish Baldur’s soul— if Hermod could prove that every 
living thing wept at Baldur’s death. Hermod shot back 
to the land of the living. He met with every creature 
that Frigg visited earlier— all of which cried for Baldur 
and begged for his return. Meanwhile, Loki watched Hermod’s 
mission with disdain. He would not let his work 
be so easily undone, but if he interfered too boldly it might 
reveal his hand in Baldur’s murder. Disguising himself as a ferocious giant, 
he hid himself at Hermod’s final stop. When the warrior came, the howling wind and craggy rocks 
each declared their love for Baldur. But the giant within spewed only contempt 
for the deceased. No matter how much Hermod begged, 
she would not shed a single tear. With his last hope dashed, the god began 
to mourn Baldur a second time. But an echo from the cave 
rang out above his sobs. Loki’s twisted cackle was well-known 
to every Asgardian, and Hermod realized he’d been tricked. As he leapt to accost the trickster, Loki took the form of a salmon 
and wriggled into the waterfall. His escape was guaranteed, 
until Thor arrived at the scene. Dragging Loki back to the cave, the gods 
bound him with a poisonous serpent. Here, Loki would remain chained 
until the end of days— the serpent dripping venom 
on his brow as punishment for dousing Asgard’s brightest light.

**Transcript**:
Baldur— son of All Father Odin 
and Queen Frigg, husband of Nanna the Peaceful, 
and God of truth and light— was the gentlest and most beloved being 
in all of Asgard. In his great hall of Breidablik, Baldur’s soothing presence 
eased his subject’s woes. But lately, he was plagued 
by troubles of his own. Every night, Baldur had gruesome visions 
foretelling his own imminent death. Determined to protect her son 
from these grim prophecies, Queen Frigg travelled 
across the nine realms, begging all living things 
not to harm Baldur. Her grace moved each being 
she encountered. Every animal and element, every plague 
and plant, every blade and bug gladly gave their word. Frigg returned to Breidablik, 
and threw a great feast to celebrate. Wine flowed freely, and soon the gods 
took turns testing Baldur’s immunity. Lurking in the corner, 
Loki rolled his eyes. The trickster god had never cared 
for Baldur the Bright, and found his new gift 
profoundly irritating. Surely there was a flaw in Frigg’s plan. Taking the form of an old woman, Loki crept to Frigg’s side 
and feigned confusion. Why were the gods attacking sweet Baldur, 
whom they all loved so dearly? Frigg told her of the oaths, 
but the old woman pressed on. Surely you didn’t receive a vow 
from everything, she asked. Frigg shrugged. The only being she hadn’t visited 
was mistletoe. After all, what god could fear 
a trifling weed? At this, Loki dashed outside 
to find a sprig of mistletoe. When he returned, the festivities 
had grown even rowdier. But not every god was enjoying the party. Baldur’s brother Hodur, who was blind 
and weapon-less, sat dejected. Seeing his opportunity, the trickster slyly offered 
Hodur a chance to participate. Loki armed him with mistletoe, 
guided his aim towards his brother, and told Hodur to hurl with all his might. The mistletoe pierced Baldur’s chest 
with deadly force. The god’s light quickly flickered out, 
and despair swept over the crowd. Within moments, the impact 
of Baldur’s death could be felt across the nine realms. But from the weeping masses, 
Hermod the Brave stepped forward. The warrior god believed that with 
the help of Odin’s mighty steed, there was no plane he could not reach. He would travel to halls of Hel herself, 
and bring Baldur home. The god rode for nine days 
and nine nights, past halls of corpses 
and over paths paved with bone. When he finally reached 
the Queen of the Underworld, Hermod begged her to return 
Baldur to his family. Hel considered taking pity, but she wanted
to know the extent of the gods’ mourning. She agreed to relinquish Baldur’s soul— if Hermod could prove that every 
living thing wept at Baldur’s death. Hermod shot back 
to the land of the living. He met with every creature 
that Frigg visited earlier— all of which cried for Baldur 
and begged for his return. Meanwhile, Loki watched Hermod’s 
mission with disdain. He would not let his work 
be so easily undone, but if he interfered too boldly it might 
reveal his hand in Baldur’s murder. Disguising himself as a ferocious giant, 
he hid himself at Hermod’s final stop. When the warrior came, the howling wind and craggy rocks 
each declared their love for Baldur. But the giant within spewed only contempt 
for the deceased. No matter how much Hermod begged, 
she would not shed a single tear. With his last hope dashed, the god began 
to mourn Baldur a second time. But an echo from the cave 
rang out above his sobs. Loki’s twisted cackle was well-known 
to every Asgardian, and Hermod realized he’d been tricked. As he leapt to accost the trickster, Loki took the form of a salmon 
and wriggled into the waterfall. His escape was guaranteed, 
until Thor arrived at the scene. Dragging Loki back to the cave, the gods 
bound him with a poisonous serpent. Here, Loki would remain chained 
until the end of days— the serpent dripping venom 
on his brow as punishment for dousing Asgard’s brightest light.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea, through a series of channels
called bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs, adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points between the blood and air 
from the outside world, they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult, but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week, though full recovery may take 
as long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation, or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea, through a series of channels
called bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs, adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points between the blood and air 
from the outside world, they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult, but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week, though full recovery may take 
as long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation, or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea, through a series of channels
called bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs, adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points between the blood and air 
from the outside world, they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult, but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week, though full recovery may take 
as long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation, or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.

mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points between the blood and air 
from the outside world, they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult, but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week, though full recovery may take 
as long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation, or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the reasons why people die from pneumonia, and the correct option is a combination of lack of access to healthcare and sustained inflammation throughout the body.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 8 is the closest match, but it does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. Question 8 asks about the groups that are more susceptible to pneumonia, and option D mentions that all of the above groups (young children, the elderly, and people with genetic and autoimmune disorders) are more susceptible.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 9. Question 9 asks about the primary mechanism by which the body fights the infection in pneumonia, and option A mentions that the body generates inflammation and releases white blood cells to engulf and digest pathogens. This is partially related to the sustained inflammation mentioned in the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would suggest Question 9 as the most similar generated MCQ, although it is not an exact match.

**Transcript**:
After many adventures in Wonderland, Alice has once again found 
herself in the court of the temperamental
Queen of Hearts. She’s about to pass through the garden
undetected, when she overhears the king
and queen arguing. “It’s quite simple,” says the queen.
“64 is the same as 65, and that’s that.” Without thinking, Alice interjects. 
“Nonsense,” she says. “If 64 were the same as 65, 
then it would be 65 and not 64 at all.” “What? How dare you!” the queen huffs. “I’ll prove it right now, 
and then it’s off with your head!” Before she can protest, Alice is dragged toward a field 
with two chessboard patterns— an 8 by 8 square and a 5 by 13 rectangle. As the queen claps her hands, 
four odd-looking soldiers approach and lie down next to each other,
covering the first chessboard. Alice sees that two of them are trapezoids
with non-diagonal sides measuring 5x5x3, while the other two are long triangles
with non-diagonal sides measuring 8x3. “See, this is 64.” The queen claps her hands again. The card soldiers get up, 
rearrange themselves, and lie down atop the second chessboard. “And that is 65." Alice gasps. She’s certain the soldiers
didn’t change size or shape moving from one board to the other. But it’s a mathematical certainty 
that the queen must be cheating somehow. Can Alice wrap her head around what’s
wrong— before she loses it? Pause the video to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Just as things aren’t looking too good 
for Alice, she remembers her geometry, and looks again at the trapezoid 
and triangle soldier lying next to each other. They look like they cover exactly half
of the rectangle, their edges forming one long line 
running from corner to corner. If that’s true, then the slopes 
of their diagonal sides should be the same. But when she calculates these slopes using the tried and true formula
"rise over run," a most curious thing happens. The trapezoid soldier’s diagonal side
goes up 2 and over 5, giving it a slope of two fifths, or 0.4. The triangle soldier’s diagonal, however,
goes up 3 and over 8, making its slope three eights, or 0.375. They’re not the same at all! Before the queen’s guards can stop her, Alice drinks a bit of her shrinking potion
to go in for a closer look. Sure enough, there’s a miniscule gap
between the triangles and trapezoids, forming a parallelogram that stretches
the entire length of the board and accounts for the missing square. There’s something even more curious
about these numbers: they’re all part of the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum 
of the two preceding ones. Fibonacci numbers have two properties
that factor in here: first, squaring a Fibonacci number 
gives you a value that’s one more or one less than the product of the Fibonacci numbers
on either side of it. In other words, 8 squared is one less 
than 5 times 13, while 5 squared is one more 
than 3 times 8. And second, the ratio between successive
Fibonacci numbers is quite similar. So similar, in fact, that it eventually
converges on the golden ratio. That’s what allows devious royals
to construct slopes that look deceptively similar. In fact, the Queen of Hearts could cobble
together an analogous conundrum out of any four consecutive
Fibonacci numbers. The higher they go, the more it seems 
like the impossible is true. But in the words of Lewis Carroll—
author of Alice in Wonderland and an accomplished mathematician
who studied this very puzzle— one can’t believe impossible things.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about calculating a slope, and the correct option is "Rise over run." Among the generated MCQs, Question 3 is related to slopes, but it's about using the knowledge of geometry to solve the problem by finding the slope of the diagonal sides of the trapezoid and triangle.

Although it's not a direct match, I would suggest Question 3 as the most similar generated MCQ, as it involves the concept of slopes.

**Transcript**:
After many adventures in Wonderland, Alice has once again found 
herself in the court of the temperamental
Queen of Hearts. She’s about to pass through the garden
undetected, when she overhears the king
and queen arguing. “It’s quite simple,” says the queen.
“64 is the same as 65, and that’s that.” Without thinking, Alice interjects. 
“Nonsense,” she says. “If 64 were the same as 65, 
then it would be 65 and not 64 at all.” “What? How dare you!” the queen huffs. “I’ll prove it right now, 
and then it’s off with your head!” Before she can protest, Alice is dragged toward a field 
with two chessboard patterns— an 8 by 8 square and a 5 by 13 rectangle. As the queen claps her hands, 
four odd-looking soldiers approach and lie down next to each other,
covering the first chessboard. Alice sees that two of them are trapezoids
with non-diagonal sides measuring 5x5x3, while the other two are long triangles
with non-diagonal sides measuring 8x3. “See, this is 64.” The queen claps her hands again. The card soldiers get up, 
rearrange themselves, and lie down atop the second chessboard. “And that is 65." Alice gasps. She’s certain the soldiers
didn’t change size or shape moving from one board to the other. But it’s a mathematical certainty 
that the queen must be cheating somehow. Can Alice wrap her head around what’s
wrong— before she loses it? Pause the video to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Just as things aren’t looking too good 
for Alice, she remembers her geometry, and looks again at the trapezoid 
and triangle soldier lying next to each other. They look like they cover exactly half
of the rectangle, their edges forming one long line 
running from corner to corner. If that’s true, then the slopes 
of their diagonal sides should be the same. But when she calculates these slopes using the tried and true formula
"rise over run," a most curious thing happens. The trapezoid soldier’s diagonal side
goes up 2 and over 5, giving it a slope of two fifths, or 0.4. The triangle soldier’s diagonal, however,
goes up 3 and over 8, making its slope three eights, or 0.375. They’re not the same at all! Before the queen’s guards can stop her, Alice drinks a bit of her shrinking potion
to go in for a closer look. Sure enough, there’s a miniscule gap
between the triangles and trapezoids, forming a parallelogram that stretches
the entire length of the board and accounts for the missing square. There’s something even more curious
about these numbers: they’re all part of the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum 
of the two preceding ones. Fibonacci numbers have two properties
that factor in here: first, squaring a Fibonacci number 
gives you a value that’s one more or one less than the product of the Fibonacci numbers
on either side of it. In other words, 8 squared is one less 
than 5 times 13, while 5 squared is one more 
than 3 times 8. And second, the ratio between successive
Fibonacci numbers is quite similar. So similar, in fact, that it eventually
converges on the golden ratio. That’s what allows devious royals
to construct slopes that look deceptively similar. In fact, the Queen of Hearts could cobble
together an analogous conundrum out of any four consecutive
Fibonacci numbers. The higher they go, the more it seems 
like the impossible is true. But in the words of Lewis Carroll—
author of Alice in Wonderland and an accomplished mathematician
who studied this very puzzle— one can’t believe impossible things.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 1 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

However, since Question 1 does not ask about identifying a non-Fibonacci sequence, I re-evaluated the options. Question 8 discusses a property of the Fibonacci series, and its options include sequences, but it's still not a direct match.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly ask which sequence is NOT part of the Fibonacci sequence, which is the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose the closest match based on the content and the Fibonacci sequence, I would say Question 1. However, please note that this is not an exact match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 6 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about Lewis Carroll's reason for studying the puzzle, and the correct answer is that he was a mathematician as well as an author. Question 6 asks about the moral of the story according to Lewis Carroll, and while it's not a direct match, it's the closest in terms of mentioning Lewis Carroll's perspective.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs directly ask about Lewis Carroll's reason for studying the puzzle. If I had to choose an index, I would say Question 6 is the most similar, but with a low confidence level.

**Transcript**:
Your mortal enemy has captured you
and hooked you up to a bizarre experiment. He’s extended your nervous system 
with one very long neuron to a target about 70 meters away. At some point, 
he’s going to fire an arrow. If you can then think a thought 
to the target before the arrow hits it, he’ll let you go. So who wins that race? In order to answer, we have to examine
the hardware of thought: neurons. The human brain has about 86 billion 
of these cells. They transmit signals down their axons 
by way of electrical impulses, or action potentials. One neuron can then pass that signal 
to the next at a synapse by way of chemical neurotransmitters. The signal is received 
by the next neuron’s dendrites, propagated down its axon,
and passed further along. So, the key factors that determine 
how quickly you think include how long it takes to generate 
an initial action potential; propagate it down the length of the axon;
and transport it through the synapse. We must also factor in the number 
of neurons involved and the distance the signal has to travel. Let’s see what this looks like in a simple
pathway— your knee-jerk reflex. A strike to your patellar tendon 
triggers an electrical impulse that travels up a sensory neuron 
to your spine. There the signal branches, 
and for the sake of simplicity, we’ll consider the segment that jumps
into a motor neuron to journey back down your leg. The total length of the neurons 
in that pathway is about 1 meter in someone 
who is 5 foot 5 inches, and on average it takes 
15 to 30 milliseconds from strike to kick. Speed is distance divided by time, so this signal travels somewhere 
between 120 to 240 kilometers per hour. The initial action potential accounts 
for 1 to 5 milliseconds and synaptic transmissions only take 
.1 to .5 milliseconds, so the bulk of that time
is spent within the axons. This is consistent with research findings that the average individual neuron sends
signals at around 180 kilometers per hour. But speeds can be boosted with myelination
and increased axon diameter. Myelin is a fatty sheath 
that insulates an axon, preventing electrical currents
from leaking out. Meanwhile, axons with larger diameters
offer less internal resistance. These compounded factors can raise
the speed of an action potential as high as 432 kilometers per hour. There’s plenty of variation: 
some people think faster than others, and your own speed of thought changes
throughout your lifetime. In particular, as you reach old age, the myelin sheath covering your axons
wears down, and other neuronal structures degrade. Back to the dastardly experiment. Arrows shot from recurve bows fly,
on average, around 240 kilometers per hour. Which means that given a sufficiently
long, myelinated or large-diameter neuron, your thoughts actually could win the race. But… there’s a wrinkle. The arrow and thought don’t leave 
the gate at the same time; first the arrow fires, 
then once you perceive it, your signal can start down its path. Processing images or music, 
participating in inner speech, and recalling memories all require
complicated neural pathways that are nowhere close to the linearity
of the knee-jerk reflex. The speed at which these thoughts
occur is mostly consistent, with variations based on myelination
and axon diameter. But the duration of a thought will vary
significantly depending on its routes, pitstops, and destination. In this case, when you perceive
a threatening stimulus, you’ll invoke a fear startle response. Similar to the knee-jerk response, a startle can be involuntary 
and quite fast. If the string twangs loud enough, you might react 
in less than 65 milliseconds. More likely though, your startle reaction
will be based on sight. Our eyes can process an image 
as quickly as 13 milliseconds, but computation of what you’re seeing
and determining the danger it poses can take as long 
as 180 to 200 milliseconds. In that time the arrow will have gained
a head start of about 13 meters. The target is far enough away that you’ve got just enough 
of a chance to catch up, if you can quickly, and quite literally,
think your way out.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the effect of myelination on the speed of signal transmission in neurons, specifically comparing pain signals (unmyelinated) to visual signals (myelinated).

Among the generated MCQs, Question 14 is the most similar:

Question 14: How can the speed of an action potential be raised?
Options: A. Only through myelination, B. Only through axon diameter, C. Through both myelination and increased axon diameter, D. Through neither myelination nor axon diameter

Although this question does not directly compare pain and visual signals, it does address the effect of myelination and axon diameter on signal transmission speed, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

Therefore, I would suggest that the most similar generated MCQ is Question 14, with an index of 14.

**Transcript**:
Your mortal enemy has captured you
and hooked you up to a bizarre experiment. He’s extended your nervous system 
with one very long neuron to a target about 70 meters away. At some point, 
he’s going to fire an arrow. If you can then think a thought 
to the target before the arrow hits it, he’ll let you go. So who wins that race? In order to answer, we have to examine
the hardware of thought: neurons. The human brain has about 86 billion 
of these cells. They transmit signals down their axons 
by way of electrical impulses, or action potentials. One neuron can then pass that signal 
to the next at a synapse by way of chemical neurotransmitters. The signal is received 
by the next neuron’s dendrites, propagated down its axon,
and passed further along. So, the key factors that determine 
how quickly you think include how long it takes to generate 
an initial action potential; propagate it down the length of the axon;
and transport it through the synapse. We must also factor in the number 
of neurons involved and the distance the signal has to travel. Let’s see what this looks like in a simple
pathway— your knee-jerk reflex. A strike to your patellar tendon 
triggers an electrical impulse that travels up a sensory neuron 
to your spine. There the signal branches, 
and for the sake of simplicity, we’ll consider the segment that jumps
into a motor neuron to journey back down your leg. The total length of the neurons 
in that pathway is about 1 meter in someone 
who is 5 foot 5 inches, and on average it takes 
15 to 30 milliseconds from strike to kick. Speed is distance divided by time, so this signal travels somewhere 
between 120 to 240 kilometers per hour. The initial action potential accounts 
for 1 to 5 milliseconds and synaptic transmissions only take 
.1 to .5 milliseconds, so the bulk of that time
is spent within the axons. This is consistent with research findings that the average individual neuron sends
signals at around 180 kilometers per hour. But speeds can be boosted with myelination
and increased axon diameter. Myelin is a fatty sheath 
that insulates an axon, preventing electrical currents
from leaking out. Meanwhile, axons with larger diameters
offer less internal resistance. These compounded factors can raise
the speed of an action potential as high as 432 kilometers per hour. There’s plenty of variation: 
some people think faster than others, and your own speed of thought changes
throughout your lifetime. In particular, as you reach old age, the myelin sheath covering your axons
wears down, and other neuronal structures degrade. Back to the dastardly experiment. Arrows shot from recurve bows fly,
on average, around 240 kilometers per hour. Which means that given a sufficiently
long, myelinated or large-diameter neuron, your thoughts actually could win the race. But… there’s a wrinkle. The arrow and thought don’t leave 
the gate at the same time; first the arrow fires, 
then once you perceive it, your signal can start down its path. Processing images or music, 
participating in inner speech, and recalling memories all require
complicated neural pathways that are nowhere close to the linearity
of the knee-jerk reflex. The speed at which these thoughts
occur is mostly consistent, with variations based on myelination
and axon diameter. But the duration of a thought will vary
significantly depending on its routes, pitstops, and destination. In this case, when you perceive
a threatening stimulus, you’ll invoke a fear startle response. Similar to the knee-jerk response, a startle can be involuntary 
and quite fast. If the string twangs loud enough, you might react 
in less than 65 milliseconds. More likely though, your startle reaction
will be based on sight. Our eyes can process an image 
as quickly as 13 milliseconds, but computation of what you’re seeing
and determining the danger it poses can take as long 
as 180 to 200 milliseconds. In that time the arrow will have gained
a head start of about 13 meters. The target is far enough away that you’ve got just enough 
of a chance to catch up, if you can quickly, and quite literally,
think your way out.

**Transcript**:
On a December night in 1910, 
the exiled former leader of Honduras, Manuel Bonilla, boarded 
a borrowed yacht in New Orleans. With a group of heavily armed accomplices, he set sail for Honduras in hopes
of reclaiming power by whatever means necessary. Bonilla had a powerful backer, the future leader 
of a notorious organization known throughout Latin America 
as El Pulpo, or "the Octopus," for its long reach. The infamous El Pulpo 
was a U.S. corporation trafficking in, of all things,
bananas. It was officially known 
as United Fruit Company— or Chiquita Brands International today. First cultivated in Southeast Asia
thousands of years ago, bananas reached the Americas 
in the early 1500s, where enslaved Africans cultivated
them in plots alongside sugar plantations. There were many different bananas, most of which looked nothing like
the bananas in supermarket aisles today. In the 1800s, captains 
from New Orleans and New England ventured to the Caribbean in search 
of coconuts and other goods. They began to experiment with bananas,
purchasing one kind, called Gros Michel, from Afro-Caribbean
farmers in Jamaica, Cuba, and Honduras. Gros Michel bananas produced large bunches
of relatively thick-skinned fruit— ideal for shipping. By the end of the 1800s, 
bananas were a hit in the US. They were affordable, 
available year-round, and endorsed by medical doctors. As bananas became big business, U.S. fruit companies wanted 
to grow their own bananas. In order to secure access to land, banana moguls lobbied and bribed
government officials in Central America, and even funded coups to ensure 
they had allies in power. In Honduras, Manuel Bonilla repaid 
the banana man who had financed his return to power
with land concessions. By the 1930s, one company dominated
the region: United Fruit, who owned over 40% of Guatemala’s 
arable land at one point. They cleared rainforest in Costa Rica,
Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama to build plantations, along with railroads, ports, 
and towns to house workers. Lured by relatively high-paying jobs,
people migrated to banana zones. From Guatemala to Colombia, United Fruit’s plantations grew
exclusively Gros Michel bananas. These densely packed farms 
had little biological diversity, making them ripe for disease epidemics. The infrastructure connecting 
these vulnerable farms could quickly spread disease: pathogens could hitch a ride from one
farm to another on workers’ boots, railroad cars, and steamships. That’s exactly what happened in the 1910s, when a fungus began to level 
Gros Michel banana plantations, first in Panama, and later throughout
Central America, spreading quickly via the same system that
had enabled big profits and cheap bananas. In a race against “Panama Disease,” banana companies abandoned 
infected plantations in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala, leaving thousands of farmers and workers 
jobless. The companies then felled 
extensive tracts of rainforests in order to establish new plantations. After World War II, the dictatorships with which United Fruit
had partnered in Guatemala and Honduras yielded to democratically elected
governments that called for land reform. In Guatemala, President Jacobo Arbenz
tried to buy back land from United Fruit and redistribute it to landless farmers. The Arbenz government offered to pay
a price based on tax records— where United Fruit had underreported
the value of the land. El Pulpo was not happy. The company launched propaganda
campaigns against Arbenz and called on its deep connections 
in the US Government for help. Citing fears of communism,
the CIA orchestrated the overthrow of the democratically elected 
Arbenz in 1954. That same year in Honduras, thousands
of United Fruit workers went on strike until the company agreed to recognize
a new labor union. With the political and economic costs 
of running from Panama Disease escalating, United Fruit finally switched 
from Gros Michel to Panama disease-resistant Cavendish
bananas in the early 1960s. Today, bananas are no longer 
as economically vital in Central America, and United Fruit Company, 
rechristened Chiquita, has lost its stranglehold
on Latin American politics. But the modern banana industry
isn’t without problems. Cavendish bananas require frequent
applications of pesticides that create hazards for farmworkers 
and ecosystems. And though they’re resistant 
to the particular pathogen that affected Gros Michel bananas, Cavendish farms 
also lack biological diversity, leaving the banana trade 
ripe for another pandemic.

**Transcript**:
On a December night in 1910, 
the exiled former leader of Honduras, Manuel Bonilla, boarded 
a borrowed yacht in New Orleans. With a group of heavily armed accomplices, he set sail for Honduras in hopes
of reclaiming power by whatever means necessary. Bonilla had a powerful backer, the future leader 
of a notorious organization known throughout Latin America 
as El Pulpo, or "the Octopus," for its long reach. The infamous El Pulpo 
was a U.S. corporation trafficking in, of all things,
bananas. It was officially known 
as United Fruit Company— or Chiquita Brands International today. First cultivated in Southeast Asia
thousands of years ago, bananas reached the Americas 
in the early 1500s, where enslaved Africans cultivated
them in plots alongside sugar plantations. There were many different bananas, most of which looked nothing like
the bananas in supermarket aisles today. In the 1800s, captains 
from New Orleans and New England ventured to the Caribbean in search 
of coconuts and other goods. They began to experiment with bananas,
purchasing one kind, called Gros Michel, from Afro-Caribbean
farmers in Jamaica, Cuba, and Honduras. Gros Michel bananas produced large bunches
of relatively thick-skinned fruit— ideal for shipping. By the end of the 1800s, 
bananas were a hit in the US. They were affordable, 
available year-round, and endorsed by medical doctors. As bananas became big business, U.S. fruit companies wanted 
to grow their own bananas. In order to secure access to land, banana moguls lobbied and bribed
government officials in Central America, and even funded coups to ensure 
they had allies in power. In Honduras, Manuel Bonilla repaid 
the banana man who had financed his return to power
with land concessions. By the 1930s, one company dominated
the region: United Fruit, who owned over 40% of Guatemala’s 
arable land at one point. They cleared rainforest in Costa Rica,
Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama to build plantations, along with railroads, ports, 
and towns to house workers. Lured by relatively high-paying jobs,
people migrated to banana zones. From Guatemala to Colombia, United Fruit’s plantations grew
exclusively Gros Michel bananas. These densely packed farms 
had little biological diversity, making them ripe for disease epidemics. The infrastructure connecting 
these vulnerable farms could quickly spread disease: pathogens could hitch a ride from one
farm to another on workers’ boots, railroad cars, and steamships. That’s exactly what happened in the 1910s, when a fungus began to level 
Gros Michel banana plantations, first in Panama, and later throughout
Central America, spreading quickly via the same system that
had enabled big profits and cheap bananas. In a race against “Panama Disease,” banana companies abandoned 
infected plantations in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala, leaving thousands of farmers and workers 
jobless. The companies then felled 
extensive tracts of rainforests in order to establish new plantations. After World War II, the dictatorships with which United Fruit
had partnered in Guatemala and Honduras yielded to democratically elected
governments that called for land reform. In Guatemala, President Jacobo Arbenz
tried to buy back land from United Fruit and redistribute it to landless farmers. The Arbenz government offered to pay
a price based on tax records— where United Fruit had underreported
the value of the land. El Pulpo was not happy. The company launched propaganda
campaigns against Arbenz and called on its deep connections 
in the US Government for help. Citing fears of communism,
the CIA orchestrated the overthrow of the democratically elected 
Arbenz in 1954. That same year in Honduras, thousands
of United Fruit workers went on strike until the company agreed to recognize
a new labor union. With the political and economic costs

**Transcript**:
Standing at almost 84 meters tall, this is the largest known living tree
on the planet. Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered
roughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete 
with this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more 
than 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce 
fossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 
to restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help
in this fight? And how do they sequester carbon 
in the first place? Like all plants, trees consume
atmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction 
called photosynthesis. This process uses energy 
from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide 
into oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume 
these carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, 
converting them to energy and releasing carbon 
back into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion
of that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored 
as newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, 
trees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon 
for as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies
and decays, some of its carbon will be released
back into the air. A significant amount of CO2
is stored in the soil, where it can remain 
for thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon
also seeps back into the atmosphere. So if trees are going to help 
fight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester 
their carbon for the longest period possible, 
while also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree 
we could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, 
super sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good 
long-term solution. Forests are complex networks 
of living organisms, and there’s no one species 
that can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant 
are always native ones; species that already play a role 
in their local environment. Preliminary research shows 
that ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity
of trees have less competition for resources and better resist
climate change. This means we can’t just plant trees 
to draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. There are numerous regions
that have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led 
by Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery 
of the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary
for human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares 
of additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised
the scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative 
but still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,
these restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200
billion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth
of humanity’s carbon emissions. More than half of the potential
forest canopy for new restoration efforts 
can be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight
into existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares
of forest by 2030. But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best 
restored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing 
to do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers
worry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended 
consequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually 
accelerate climate change. And even if we succeed 
in restoring these areas, future generations would need
to protect them from the natural and economic forces
that previously depleted them. Taken together, these challenges
have damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity 
of rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important 
it is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring 
some of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction 
necessary to combat climate change on a larger scale. If we get it right, maybe these modern
trees will have time to grow into carbon carrying titans.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the percentage of dry weight of a tree that consists of carbon. Although none of the generated MCQs ask the same question, Question 3 asks about the amount of carbon dioxide sequestered by the General Sherman tree, which is related to the topic of carbon content in trees.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is most similar in terms of intent and content, I would suggest Question 3, but with a low confidence level.

of the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary
for human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares 
of additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised
the scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative 
but still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,
these restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200
billion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth
of humanity’s carbon emissions. More than half of the potential
forest canopy for new restoration efforts 
can be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight
into existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares
of forest by 2030. But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best 
restored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing 
to do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers
worry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended 
consequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually 
accelerate climate change. And even if we succeed 
in restoring these areas, future generations would need
to protect them from the natural and economic forces
that previously depleted them. Taken together, these challenges
have damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity 
of rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important 
it is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring 
some of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that shares a similar intent and theme.

The ground truth MCQ is about maximizing the amount of carbon within a natural ecosystem composed of trees, and the correct option is "never" harvesting the trees. This implies that the question is related to the idea of preserving and protecting existing forests to maintain their carbon sequestration capabilities.

Among the generated MCQs, Question 9 is the most similar in terms of intent and theme. It asks about the primary reason why native trees are considered the most sustainable option for planting, and the correct option is that they already play a role in their local environment. While this question does not directly address the issue of harvesting trees, it touches on the idea of preserving and protecting existing ecosystems by planting native trees.

Therefore, I would suggest that Question 9 is the most similar generated MCQ to the ground truth MCQ, although it is not a direct match.

**Transcript**:
Standing at almost 84 meters tall, this is the largest known living tree
on the planet. Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered
roughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete 
with this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more 
than 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce 
fossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 
to restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help
in this fight? And how do they sequester carbon 
in the first place? Like all plants, trees consume
atmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction 
called photosynthesis. This process uses energy 
from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide 
into oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume 
these carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, 
converting them to energy and releasing carbon 
back into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion
of that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored 
as newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, 
trees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon 
for as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies
and decays, some of its carbon will be released
back into the air. A significant amount of CO2
is stored in the soil, where it can remain 
for thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon
also seeps back into the atmosphere. So if trees are going to help 
fight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester 
their carbon for the longest period possible, 
while also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree 
we could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, 
super sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good 
long-term solution. Forests are complex networks 
of living organisms, and there’s no one species 
that can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant 
are always native ones; species that already play a role 
in their local environment. Preliminary research shows 
that ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity
of trees have less competition for resources and better resist
climate change. This means we can’t just plant trees 
to draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. There are numerous regions
that have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led 
by Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery 
of the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the wording of Question 9 is different from the ground truth MCQ, the intent and content are similar. The ground truth MCQ asks about promoting a specific tree species for carbon storage, while Question 9 asks about the primary reason why native trees are considered the most sustainable option for planting. However, the correct option for Question 9 (C. They already play a role in their local environment) aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ (A. there is none, we should promote only endemic species). 

This indicates that the transcript emphasizes the importance of native tree species in their local environments, rather than promoting a single champion species for carbon storage.

a hearing anyway, and she has just five days to prepare." This is too much. If the government won’t be 
a voice of reason, I’ll have to. That’s better. I’m surprised you good legislators
have agreed to move this hearing forward. You’re falling prey to a type 
of argument from ignorance: assuming that a claim is true 
because it hasn’t been proven false. The claim being Senator McCarthy’s 
accusations against Judge Kenyon, for which he provided 
no legitimate evidence. Is that right? I thought so. Some of the so-called communist 
organizations he accused her of joining don’t even exist. To assume a claim is true 
because it hasn’t been proven false ignores many other possibilities: that it hasn’t been proven false yet, 
that it can’t be proven true or false, or that it isn’t completely true 
or completely false, to name a few. This leads to a handy rule of thumb: the burden of proof lies with the person
making the claim. In other words, you make the claim,
you supply the proof. If someone told you aliens exist, would you head off to find proof
that they don’t exist? Of course not. You’d tell that person 
to show you the UFO. The same applies when someone 
makes a claim that contradicts an established consensus. So when all the available evidence 
suggests that humans are causing an increase 
in global temperatures, the burden of proof has been fulfilled— if you disagree, it becomes 
your responsibility to prove otherwise. Right? Ah, I’ve gotten ahead of myself. You’ll see what I mean soon enough. Anyway, your legal system 
supposedly recognizes this rule— so what are you all doing here? "It’s July 17th, 1950, and the senate subcommittee has officially
dismissed all charges against Kenyon." As they should! "It’s 1954, and the senate 
has formally disciplined McCarthy." Took them long enough! "He will serve out the rest of his term, but will never again be elected 
to a public office. Because of his widespread 
anti-communist influence, hundreds of people have been incarcerated,
and thousands have lost their jobs." Ah! Look what the communists did!

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 11. 

This question matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Both questions address the concept of burden of proof and its application to McCarthy's claim against Dorothy Kenyon. The correct option in both questions is also the same, stating that the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim. 

While Question 3 also addresses the topic of McCarthy's argument, it focuses on the type of argument being made (argument from ignorance), rather than the specific fallacy related to burden of proof. Therefore, Question 11 is a more direct match to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On the edge of the vast Sahara desert, citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu and took to the wilderness. They buried chests in the desert sand,
hid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure 
more valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Founded around 1100 CE 
in what is now Mali, the city of Timbuktu started 
out as an unremarkable trading post. But its unique location 
soon changed that. Timbuktu marked the intersection
of two essential trade routes, where caravans bringing 
salt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold
from the African interior. By the late 1300s, these trade routes 
made Timbuktu rich, and the city’s rulers, 
the kings of the Mali Empire, built monuments and academies
that drew scholars from Egypt, Spain, and Morocco. The city’s prime location also made
it a target for warlords and conquerors. As the Mali Empire declined, 
one of its domains, Songhai, began to gain power. In 1468, the Songhai king 
conquered Timbuktu, burning buildings and murdering scholars. But in time, intellectual life 
in the city flourished again. The reign of the second king 
of the Songhai Empire, Askia Mohammed Toure, marked the beginning of a golden age 
in Timbuktu. He reversed his predecessor’s
regressive policies and encouraged learning. The Songhai rulers and most of Timbuktu’s 
population were Muslim, and the scholars of Timbuktu 
studied Islam alongside secular topics 
like mathematics and philosophy. In the libraries of Timbuktu, tracts of Greek philosophy stood
alongside the writings of local historians, scientists,
and poets. The city’s most prominent scholar,
Ahmed Baba, challenged prevailing opinions
on subjects ranging from smoking to slavery. Gold and salt trade had funded
the city’s transformation into a center of learning. Now, the products 
of that intellectual culture became the most sought-after 
commodity. With paper from faraway Venice and vibrant ink from local plants
and minerals, the scribes of Timbuktu produced 
texts in both Arabic and local languages. Written in calligraphy and decorated
with intricate geometric designs, the books of Timbuktu were in demand
among the wealthiest members of society. In 1591, the golden age 
came to an abrupt end when the Moroccan king 
captured Timbuktu. Moroccan forces imprisoned 
Ahmed Baba and other prominent scholars and confiscated their libraries. In the centuries that followed, the city 
weathered a succession of conquests. In the mid-1800s, 
Sufi Jihadists occupied Timbuktu and destroyed many non-religious
manuscripts. 1894, French colonial forces seized
control of the city, stealing even more manuscripts
and sending them to Europe. French became the official language
taught in schools, and new generations in Timbuktu couldn’t read the Arabic manuscripts 
that remained. Through it all, the literary tradition
of Timbuktu didn’t die— it went underground. Some families built secret libraries
in their homes, or buried the books in their gardens. Others stashed them in abandoned caves 
or holes in the desert. The priceless manuscripts of Timbuktu dispersed to villages 
throughout the surrounding area, where regular citizens guarded 
them for hundreds of years. As desertification and war 
impoverished the region, families held on to the ancient books even as they faced desperate poverty
and near-starvation. Even today, the struggle to protect
the books continues. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, Timbuktu scholar Abdel Kader Haidara
painstakingly retrieved hidden manuscripts from all over northern Mali 
and brought them back to Timbuktu. But in 2012, civil war in Mali 
once again threatened the manuscripts, most of which were evacuated
to nearby Bamako. Their future remains uncertain, as they face both human 
and environmental threats. These books represent our best—
and often only— sources on the pre-colonial history
of the region. Many of them have never been 
read by modern scholars, and still more remain lost 
or hidden in the desert. At stake in the efforts to protect
them is the history they contain— and the efforts of countless generations
to protect that history from being lost.

**Transcript**:
On the edge of the vast Sahara desert, citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu and took to the wilderness. They buried chests in the desert sand,
hid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure 
more valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Founded around 1100 CE 
in what is now Mali, the city of Timbuktu started 
out as an unremarkable trading post. But its unique location 
soon changed that. Timbuktu marked the intersection
of two essential trade routes, where caravans bringing 
salt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold
from the African interior. By the late 1300s, these trade routes 
made Timbuktu rich, and the city’s rulers, 
the kings of the Mali Empire, built monuments and academies
that drew scholars from Egypt, Spain, and Morocco. The city’s prime location also made
it a target for warlords and conquerors. As the Mali Empire declined, 
one of its domains, Songhai, began to gain power. In 1468, the Songhai king 
conquered Timbuktu, burning buildings and murdering scholars. But in time, intellectual life 
in the city flourished again. The reign of the second king

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 2. 

Although the ground truth MCQ asks for the domain of the king who conquered Timbuktu in 1468, and Question 2 asks for the king of the Songhai Empire who conquered Timbuktu in 1468, both questions are referring to the same event and are looking for the same information about the conqueror of Timbuktu in 1468. The correct option for the ground truth MCQ is "C. Songhai", and the correct option for Question 2 is "D. The predecessor of Askia Mohammed Toure", which is implied to be the king of the Songhai Empire.

However, it's worth noting that there's no direct match for the ground truth MCQ among the generated MCQs, as none of them ask for the domain of the king who conquered Timbuktu in 1468. But Question 2 is the closest match in terms of question intent and content.

**Transcript**:
On the edge of the vast Sahara desert, citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu and took to the wilderness. They buried chests in the desert sand,
hid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure 
more valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Founded around 1100 CE 
in what is now Mali, the city of Timbuktu started 
out as an unremarkable trading post. But its unique location 
soon changed that. Timbuktu marked the intersection
of two essential trade routes, where caravans bringing 
salt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold
from the African interior. By the late 1300s, these trade routes 
made Timbuktu rich, and the city’s rulers, 
the kings of the Mali Empire, built monuments and academies
that drew scholars from Egypt, Spain, and Morocco. The city’s prime location also made
it a target for warlords and conquerors. As the Mali Empire declined, 
one of its domains, Songhai, began to gain power. In 1468, the Songhai king 
conquered Timbuktu, burning buildings and murdering scholars. But in time, intellectual life 
in the city flourished again. The reign of the second king 
of the Songhai Empire, Askia Mohammed Toure, marked the beginning of a golden age 
in Timbuktu. He reversed his predecessor’s
regressive policies and encouraged learning. The Songhai rulers and most of Timbuktu’s 
population were Muslim, and the scholars of Timbuktu 
studied Islam alongside secular topics 
like mathematics and philosophy. In the libraries of Timbuktu, tracts of Greek philosophy stood
alongside the writings of local historians, scientists,
and poets. The city’s most prominent scholar,
Ahmed Baba, challenged prevailing opinions
on subjects ranging from smoking to slavery. Gold and salt trade had funded
the city’s transformation into a center of learning. Now, the products 
of that intellectual culture became the most sought-after 
commodity. With paper from faraway Venice and vibrant ink from local plants
and minerals, the scribes of Timbuktu produced 
texts in both Arabic and local languages. Written in calligraphy and decorated
with intricate geometric designs, the books of Timbuktu were in demand
among the wealthiest members of society. In 1591, the golden age 
came to an abrupt end when the Moroccan king 
captured Timbuktu. Moroccan forces imprisoned 
Ahmed Baba and other prominent scholars and confiscated their libraries. In the centuries that followed, the city 
weathered a succession of conquests. In the mid-1800s, 
Sufi Jihadists occupied Timbuktu and destroyed many non-religious
manuscripts. 1894, French colonial forces seized
control of the city, stealing even more manuscripts
and sending them to Europe. French became the official language
taught in schools, and new generations in Timbuktu couldn’t read the Arabic manuscripts 
that remained. Through it all, the literary tradition
of Timbuktu didn’t die— it went underground. Some families built secret libraries
in their homes, or buried the books in their gardens. Others stashed them in abandoned caves 
or holes in the desert. The priceless manuscripts of Timbuktu dispersed to villages 
throughout the surrounding area, where regular citizens guarded 
them for hundreds of years. As desertification and war 
impoverished the region, families held on to the ancient books even as they faced desperate poverty
and near-starvation. Even today, the struggle to protect
the books continues. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, Timbuktu scholar Abdel Kader Haidara
painstakingly retrieved hidden manuscripts from all over northern Mali 
and brought them back to Timbuktu. But in 2012, civil war in Mali 
once again threatened the manuscripts, most of which were evacuated
to nearby Bamako. Their future remains uncertain, as they face both human 
and environmental threats. These books represent our best—
and often only— sources on the pre-colonial history
of the region. Many of them have never been 
read by modern scholars, and still more remain lost 
or hidden in the desert. At stake in the efforts to protect
them is the history they contain— and the efforts of countless generations
to protect that history from being lost.

**Transcript**:
If you go to the store in search of milk, there are a dizzying number 
of products to choose from. There’s dairy milk, 
but also plant-based products. To turn a plant into something
resembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained,
rinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried, and milled into flour. The plant paste or flour is then 
fortified with vitamins and minerals, flavoured, and diluted with water. The result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities
of animal milk. So which milk is actually best for you? Let’s dive into some of the most 
popular milks: dairy, almond, soy, or oat? A 250 ml glass of cow’s milk contains
8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, 
and 2 to 8 grams of fat depending on if it’s skim, 
reduced fat, or whole. That’s approximately 15% 
the daily protein an average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates
and 2 to 15% the fat. Most plant-based milks have 
less carbohydrates than dairy milk. They also have less fat, but more
of what’s often called “good fats.” Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients
vitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don’t occur naturally 
in most plant-based milks. Looking more closely 
at our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low 
in protein compared to dairy. But while almond milk has the least
nutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, 
a healthy type of fibre. It also has a lot of carbohydrates
compared to other plant milks— sometimes as much as dairy milk. Soy milk, meanwhile, 
has as much protein as cow’s milk and is also a great source
of potassium. Soybeans contain isoflavone, which people used to think 
might trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen. But ultimately, soy milk contains
very small amounts of isoflavones, which have a much weaker effect
on our bodies than estrogen. Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be
the clear winner: if you’re lactose intolerant, 
then the plant-based milks pull ahead, while if you’re allergic to nuts,
almond milk is out. For people who don’t have access 
to a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient
way to get these nutrients. But all else being equal, 
any one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part 
of a balanced diet. That’s why for many people, 
the milk that’s best for you is actually the milk 
that’s best for the planet. So which uses the fewest resources
and produces the least pollution? It takes almost 4 square kilometers
to produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation
and habitat destruction. Most of that is land the cows live on,
and some is used to grow their feed. Many cows eat soy beans and oats. It takes much less land to grow 
the oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow— only about a quarter square kilometer
per glass. Almond milk has similar land use. But where that land is also matters— soybean farms are a major driver
of deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren’t. Making milk uses water 
every step of the way, but it’s the farming stage 
where big differences emerge. Dairy milk uses the most water—
about 120 liters per glass, mostly to water cows 
and grow their food. Almonds take second place, at more
than 70 liters of water per glass. Most of that water is used to grow
almond trees, which take years of watering before
they start producing almonds. The trees must be watered consistently,
or they die, while many other crops can be
left fallow and still produce later. All told, soy and oats require less 
water to grow: only about 5 to 10 liters 
per glass of milk. Milk production generates some
greenhouse gas emissions— about 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms per glass 
for the plant-based milks. But for dairy milk, the cows themselves 
also produce emissions by burping and farting out large
quantities of the gas methane. Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram 
of greenhouse gas emissions. So while depending on your dietary
needs, any one of these milks may be a good
fit, in terms of the health of our planet there’s a strong case for choosing 
plant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk.

to produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation
and habitat destruction. Most of that is land the cows live on,
and some is used to grow their feed. Many cows eat soy beans and oats. It takes much less land to grow 
the oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow— only about a quarter square kilometer
per glass. Almond milk has similar land use. But where that land is also matters— soybean farms are a major driver
of deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren’t. Making milk uses water 
every step of the way, but it’s the farming stage 
where big differences emerge. Dairy milk uses the most water—
about 120 liters per glass, mostly to water cows 
and grow their food. Almonds take second place, at more
than 70 liters of water per glass. Most of that water is used to grow
almond trees, which take years of watering before
they start producing almonds. The trees must be watered consistently,
or they die, while many other crops can be
left fallow and still produce later. All told, soy and oats require less 
water to grow: only about 5 to 10 liters 
per glass of milk. Milk production generates some
greenhouse gas emissions— about 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms per glass 
for the plant-based milks. But for dairy milk, the cows themselves 
also produce emissions by burping and farting out large
quantities of the gas methane. Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram 
of greenhouse gas emissions. So while depending on your dietary
needs, any one of these milks may be a good
fit, in terms of the health of our planet there’s a strong case for choosing 
plant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk.

**Transcript**:
If you go to the store in search of milk, there are a dizzying number 
of products to choose from. There’s dairy milk, 
but also plant-based products. To turn a plant into something
resembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained,
rinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried, and milled into flour. The plant paste or flour is then 
fortified with vitamins and minerals, flavoured, and diluted with water. The result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities
of animal milk. So which milk is actually best for you? Let’s dive into some of the most 
popular milks: dairy, almond, soy, or oat? A 250 ml glass of cow’s milk contains
8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, 
and 2 to 8 grams of fat depending on if it’s skim, 
reduced fat, or whole. That’s approximately 15% 
the daily protein an average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates
and 2 to 15% the fat. Most plant-based milks have 
less carbohydrates than dairy milk. They also have less fat, but more
of what’s often called “good fats.” Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients
vitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don’t occur naturally 
in most plant-based milks. Looking more closely 
at our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low 
in protein compared to dairy. But while almond milk has the least
nutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, 
a healthy type of fibre. It also has a lot of carbohydrates
compared to other plant milks— sometimes as much as dairy milk. Soy milk, meanwhile, 
has as much protein as cow’s milk and is also a great source
of potassium. Soybeans contain isoflavone, which people used to think 
might trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen. But ultimately, soy milk contains
very small amounts of isoflavones, which have a much weaker effect
on our bodies than estrogen. Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be
the clear winner: if you’re lactose intolerant, 
then the plant-based milks pull ahead, while if you’re allergic to nuts,
almond milk is out. For people who don’t have access 
to a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient
way to get these nutrients. But all else being equal, 
any one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part 
of a balanced diet. That’s why for many people, 
the milk that’s best for you is actually the milk 
that’s best for the planet. So which uses the fewest resources
and produces the least pollution? It takes almost 4 square kilometers
to produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation

**Transcript**:
History’s first empire rose 
out of a hot, dry landscape, without rainfall to nourish crops, 
without trees or stones for building. In spite of all this, its inhabitants
built the world’s first cities, with monumental architecture 
and large populations— and they built them 
entirely out of mud. Sumer occupied the southern part 
of modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia means “between two rivers”— the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used
irrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm 
large areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this 
were slowly springing up around the world. But Sumerians were the first
to take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied
homes and temples. They invented the wheel— a potter’s wheel, for turning mud 
into household goods and tools. Those clay bricks gave rise 
to the world’s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE. At the top of the city’s social ladder
were priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople,
farmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire 
consisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations. They were loosely linked 
by language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control. The earliest cities were Uruk, 
Ur, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role 
somewhere between a priest and a ruler. Sometimes they fought against 
each other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,
considered the city’s founder. The largest and most important building 
in the city was this patron god’s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed
as a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began 
to expand their reach. The potter’s wheel found a new home 
on chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds 
and date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried 
them vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, 
they built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, 
Anatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, 
lapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention 
of the world’s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting
for Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, 
the early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first
written laws and created the first school system, 
designed to teach the craft of writing— and pioneered some less exciting
innovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying 
from dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,
and copied works of literature— hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, 
magic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told 
the story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was
also the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer
was no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured
into the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,
adopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script 
to express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon
conquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians
existed side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused 
only on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed
off the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared 
back into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered
until the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived 
on for thousands of years— first through the Akkadians,
then the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian 
inventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures. Some persist today.

**Transcript**:
History’s first empire rose 
out of a hot, dry landscape, without rainfall to nourish crops, 
without trees or stones for building. In spite of all this, its inhabitants
built the world’s first cities, with monumental architecture 
and large populations— and they built them 
entirely out of mud. Sumer occupied the southern part 
of modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia means “between two rivers”— the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used
irrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm 
large areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this 
were slowly springing up around the world. But Sumerians were the first
to take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied
homes and temples. They invented the wheel— a potter’s wheel, for turning mud 
into household goods and tools. Those clay bricks gave rise 
to the world’s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE. At the top of the city’s social ladder
were priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople,
farmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire 
consisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations. They were loosely linked 
by language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control. The earliest cities were Uruk, 
Ur, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role 
somewhere between a priest and a ruler. Sometimes they fought against 
each other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,
considered the city’s founder. The largest and most important building 
in the city was this patron god’s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed
as a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began 
to expand their reach. The potter’s wheel found a new home 
on chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds 
and date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried 
them vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, 
they built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, 
Anatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, 
lapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention 
of the world’s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting
for Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, 
the early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first
written laws and created the first school system, 
designed to teach the craft of writing— and pioneered some less exciting
innovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying 
from dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,
and copied works of literature— hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, 
magic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told 
the story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was
also the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer
was no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured
into the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,
adopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script 
to express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon
conquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians
existed side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused 
only on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed
off the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared 
back into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered
until the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived 
on for thousands of years— first through the Akkadians,
then the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian 
inventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures. Some persist today.

without trees or stones for building. In spite of all this, its inhabitants
built the world’s first cities, with monumental architecture 
and large populations— and they built them 
entirely out of mud. Sumer occupied the southern part 
of modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia means “between two rivers”— the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used
irrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm 
large areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this 
were slowly springing up around the world. But Sumerians were the first
to take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied
homes and temples. They invented the wheel— a potter’s wheel, for turning mud 
into household goods and tools. Those clay bricks gave rise 
to the world’s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE. At the top of the city’s social ladder
were priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople,
farmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire 
consisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations. They were loosely linked 
by language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control. The earliest cities were Uruk, 
Ur, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role 
somewhere between a priest and a ruler. Sometimes they fought against 
each other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,
considered the city’s founder. The largest and most important building 
in the city was this patron god’s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed
as a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began 
to expand their reach. The potter’s wheel found a new home 
on chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds 
and date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried 
them vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, 
they built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, 
Anatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, 
lapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention 
of the world’s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting
for Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, 
the early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first
written laws and created the first school system, 
designed to teach the craft of writing— and pioneered some less exciting
innovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying 
from dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,
and copied works of literature— hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, 
magic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told 
the story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was
also the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer
was no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured
into the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,
adopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script 
to express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon
conquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians
existed side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused 
only on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed
off the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared 
back into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered
until the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived 
on for thousands of years— first through the Akkadians,
then the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian 
inventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures. Some persist today.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a way to create a similar MCQ. 

The ground truth MCQ is about the invention of the first writing system, called cuneiform, by the Sumerians. To find a similar MCQ, we would look for a question that is also about the invention or purpose of something.

If I had to choose from the given options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose one based on the criteria of "invention" or "purpose", I would choose Question 5, but it's still not similar.

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that are relevant to the topic of the Sumerians and their inventions. 

For example, a generated MCQ could be:
Question: What was the primary purpose of the Sumerians' invention of the wheel?
Options: A. For transportation, B. For trade, C. For warfare, D. For agriculture

Or
Question: What was the main reason for the Sumerians' development of a system of writing?
Options: A. To record laws, B. To write literature, C. To send letters, D. To keep track of business transactions

These MCQs would be more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
This is a kindergarten
we designed in 2007. We made this kindergarten 
to be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation
on top of the roof. If you are a parent, you know that kids love
to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this? The principal of this kindergarten said, "No, I don't want a handrail." I said, "It's impossible." But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof? So that it can catch
the children falling off?" (Laughter) I said, "It's impossible." And of course,
the government official said, "Of course you have to have a handrail." But we could keep 
that idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call 
this rope as a handrail. But of course, rope has nothing
to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more, and more, more. (Laughter) Sometimes 40 children 
are around a tree. The boy on the branch, he loves the tree
so he is eating the tree. (Laughter) And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. (Laughter) Feeding time. (Laughter) 
(Applause) And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see
children on top of the roof, not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high,
you see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place --
there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water
to your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's putting water into his boots. (Laughter) This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year. And there is no boundary
between inside and outside. So it means basically
this architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary
between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back. (Laughter) But the point is,
in that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. But here, just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly, we consider
noise very important. You know that children
sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten, these children show
amazing concentration in class. And you know, our kind grew up
in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know, you can talk
to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know, these days we are trying to make
everything under control. You know, it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is 50 degrees. And also, you should know
that you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So, children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. (Laughter) I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always 
some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish
another monkey from above. (Laughter) Monkeys. (Laughter) And each classroom has
at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus
comes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building, right next to that
oval-shaped kindergarten. The building is only
five meters tall with seven floors. And of course,
the ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So, we put our children,
a daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. (Laughter) And he is trying to see
if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful
in Tokyo, as you know. (Laughter) The driver in front,
she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days, kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of
opportunity we are losing these days. Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten
do 4,000 meters on average. And these children have
the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says, "I don't train them.
We leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep." (Laughter) They keep running. (Laughter) My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable
of changing this world, and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts
to change the lives of children. Thank you very much. (Applause)

Deep in the Amazon rainforest 
in the river Nea’ocoyá, lived,
according to Siekopai legend, a school
of particularly big and tasty fish. When the rains came and the water rose, 
the fish appeared, swimming away as the waters fell again. The villagers along the river reveled
in this occasional bounty— and wanted more. They followed them upriver deep 
into the jungle to a lagoon that thundered 
with the sound of flapping fish. The whole village set up camp 
by the lagoon, bringing barbasco, a poison they would put
in the water to stun the fish. Meanwhile, their young shaman took a walk. He sensed he might not be 
completely alone. Then, he came to a monse tree
humming so loudly he could hear it even above the thunder
of the fish. With that, he was sure:
spirits lived here. Back at camp, he warned his people 
these fish had an owner. He would find the owner. Until he returned, no one should fish. He went to the humming tree. Inside was a hollow as big as a house,
full of busy weavers. Their chief invited him in, explaining that the juicy 
little siripia fruits were ripening, and they were weaving
baskets to collect them. Though they looked and acted like people, the shaman knew they were juri,
or air goblins, who could fly and control the winds. They taught him how to weave. Before the shaman left, the goblin chief whispered 
some cryptic instructions in his ear. Finally, he told him to tie 
a pineapple shoot outside a hollow log and sleep inside that night. Back at camp, the villagers were fishing
with barbasco poison, cooking, and eating. Only the shaman’s little sister refrained. Then, everyone else fell
into a deep sleep. The shaman and his sister 
yelled and shook them, but they wouldn’t wake. It was getting dark, 
so the shaman and his sister tied the pineapple sprout outside 
the hollow log and crawled inside. A strong wind rose—
the mark of the air goblins. It broke branches 
and brought down trees. Caymans, boas and jaguars roared. The water began to rise. The fish flopped off the drying racks 
and swam away. The pineapple sprout turned into a dog. All night it barked, keeping the jungle
creatures away from the fallen tree. When dawn broke, the flood receded. The fish were gone, 
and most of the people were, too: the jungle animals had devoured them. Only the shaman’s relatives survived. When his family turned toward him, the shaman realized what the goblins meant
when they said the fruits were ripening: they weren’t really collecting 
siripia fruits at all, but human eyes. The shaman’s older sister called him over, trying to touch his face 
with her long, sharp nails. He backed away and, remembering 
the goblin chief’s instructions, threw palm seeds at her face. The seeds became eyes. But then she transformed 
into a white-lipped peccary and ran away— still alive, but no longer human. The shaman and his little sister’s 
whole community was gone. They went to live with another village, where he taught everyone to weave baskets,
as the air goblins had taught him. But he couldn’t forget the last 
of the goblin chief’s words, which told him how to get revenge. He returned to the air goblins’ home
carrying chili peppers wrapped in leaves. As the goblins watched 
through their peepholes, the shaman made a fire 
and put the chili peppers on it. The fire began to smoke the tree out. The goblins who had eaten 
people’s eyes died. Those who hadn’t 
were light enough to fly away. So the goblins, like the humans, 
paid a steep price. But they also lived to tell the tale,
like the shaman. In Siekopai legend, where the spirit 
and human worlds meet, there are no clear victors, and even death
is an opportunity for renewal.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different text, specifically the poem "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 4 is the closest match. This question asks about a specific detail in the text (the Jabberwock's eyes) and provides multiple-choice options.

But, in terms of content and intent, there is no match. The ground truth MCQ asks about the meaning of "siripia fruits" in the context of the Siekopai legend, while the generated MCQs are related to a different text.

Therefore, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ, but if I had to choose one based on format and style, I would say Question 4.

Index: 4 (with the caveat that it's not a real match)

**Transcript**:
Deep in the Amazon rainforest 
in the river Nea’ocoyá, lived,
according to Siekopai legend, a school
of particularly big and tasty fish. When the rains came and the water rose, 
the fish appeared, swimming away as the waters fell again. The villagers along the river reveled
in this occasional bounty— and wanted more. They followed them upriver deep 
into the jungle to a lagoon that thundered 
with the sound of flapping fish. The whole village set up camp 
by the lagoon, bringing barbasco, a poison they would put
in the water to stun the fish. Meanwhile, their young shaman took a walk. He sensed he might not be 
completely alone. Then, he came to a monse tree
humming so loudly he could hear it even above the thunder
of the fish. With that, he was sure:
spirits lived here. Back at camp, he warned his people 
these fish had an owner. He would find the owner. Until he returned, no one should fish. He went to the humming tree. Inside was a hollow as big as a house,
full of busy weavers. Their chief invited him in, explaining that the juicy 
little siripia fruits were ripening, and they were weaving
baskets to collect them. Though they looked and acted like people, the shaman knew they were juri,
or air goblins, who could fly and control the winds. They taught him how to weave. Before the shaman left, the goblin chief whispered 
some cryptic instructions in his ear. Finally, he told him to tie 
a pineapple shoot outside a hollow log and sleep inside that night. Back at camp, the villagers were fishing
with barbasco poison, cooking, and eating. Only the shaman’s little sister refrained. Then, everyone else fell
into a deep sleep. The shaman and his sister 
yelled and shook them, but they wouldn’t wake. It was getting dark, 
so the shaman and his sister tied the pineapple sprout outside 
the hollow log and crawled inside. A strong wind rose—
the mark of the air goblins. It broke branches 
and brought down trees. Caymans, boas and jaguars roared. The water began to rise. The fish flopped off the drying racks 
and swam away. The pineapple sprout turned into a dog. All night it barked, keeping the jungle
creatures away from the fallen tree. When dawn broke, the flood receded. The fish were gone, 
and most of the people were, too: the jungle animals had devoured them. Only the shaman’s relatives survived. When his family turned toward him, the shaman realized what the goblins meant
when they said the fruits were ripening: they weren’t really collecting 
siripia fruits at all, but human eyes. The shaman’s older sister called him over, trying to touch his face 
with her long, sharp nails. He backed away and, remembering 
the goblin chief’s instructions, threw palm seeds at her face. The seeds became eyes. But then she transformed 
into a white-lipped peccary and ran away— still alive, but no longer human. The shaman and his little sister’s 
whole community was gone. They went to live with another village, where he taught everyone to weave baskets,
as the air goblins had taught him. But he couldn’t forget the last 
of the goblin chief’s words, which told him how to get revenge. He returned to the air goblins’ home
carrying chili peppers wrapped in leaves. As the goblins watched 
through their peepholes, the shaman made a fire 
and put the chili peppers on it. The fire began to smoke the tree out. The goblins who had eaten 
people’s eyes died. Those who hadn’t 
were light enough to fly away. So the goblins, like the humans, 
paid a steep price. But they also lived to tell the tale,
like the shaman. In Siekopai legend, where the spirit 
and human worlds meet, there are no clear victors, and even death
is an opportunity for renewal.

**Transcript**:
In a study in the 1990s, participants recalled getting lost 
in a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories
in vivid detail— one even remembered that the old man
who rescued him was wearing a flannel shirt. But none of these people 
had actually gotten lost in a mall. They produced these false memories when the psychologists conducting 
the study told them they’d gotten lost, and although they might not remember
the incident, their parents had confirmed it. And it wasn’t just one or two people 
who thought they remembered getting lost— a quarter of the participants did. These findings may sound unbelievable, but they actually reflect 
a very common experience. Our memories are sometimes unreliable. And though we still don’t know precisely
what causes this fallibility on a neurological level, research has highlighted some 
of the most common ways our memories diverge from what actually happened. The mall study highlights how we can
incorporate information from outside sources, like other people or the news, into our personal recollections
without realizing it. This kind of suggestibility is just 
one influence on our memories. Take another study, in which researchers briefly showed 
a random collection of photographs to a group of participants, including images of a university campus
none of them had ever visited. When shown the images three weeks later, a majority of participants said 
that they had probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. The participants misattributed information
from one context— an image they’d seen— onto another— a memory of something
they believed they actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown
an image of a magnifying glass, and then told to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw 
the magnifying glass and the lollipop. They struggled to link the objects 
to the correct context— whether they actually saw them,
or simply imagined them. Another study, where a psychologist 
questioned over 2,000 people on their views about the legalization 
of marijuana, highlights yet another kind 
of influence on memory. Participants answered questions 
in 1973 and 1982. Those who said they had supported
marijuana legalization in 1973, but reported they were against it in 1982, were more likely to recall that they were 
actually against legalization in 1973— bringing their old views in line 
with their current ones. Our current opinions,
feelings, and experiences can bias our memories 
of how we felt in the past. In another study, researchers gave two groups
of participants background information on a historical war and asked them to rate
the likelihood that each side would win. They gave each group the same information, except that they only told one group
who had actually won the war— the other group didn’t know 
the real world outcome. In theory, both groups’ answers 
should be similar, because the likelihood
of each side winning isn’t effected by who actually won— if there’s a 20% chance of thunderstorms,
and a thunderstorm happens, the chance of thunderstorms
doesn’t retroactively go up to 100%. Still, the group that knew 
how the war ended rated the winning side as more likely 
to win than the group who did not. All of these fallibilities of memory 
can have real-world impacts. If police interrogations use leading
questions with eye witnesses or suspects, suggestibility could result in incorrect 
identifications or unreliable confessions. Even in the absence of leading questions, misattribution can lead to inaccurate 
eyewitness testimony. In a courtroom, if a judge rules a piece of evidence 
inadmissible and tells jurors to disregard it,
they may not be able to do so. In a medical setting, if a patient 
seeks a second opinion and the second physician is aware 
of the first one’s diagnosis, that knowledge may bias their conclusion. Our memories are not ironclad 
representations of reality, but subjective perceptions. And there’s not necessarily
anything wrong with that— the problems arise when we treat
memory as fact, rather than accepting
this fundamental truth about the nature of our recollections.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically the tongue map and taste, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to a study on false memories.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
In a study in the 1990s, participants recalled getting lost 
in a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories
in vivid detail— one even remembered that the old man
who rescued him was wearing a flannel shirt. But none of these people 
had actually gotten lost in a mall. They produced these false memories when the psychologists conducting 
the study told them they’d gotten lost, and although they might not remember
the incident, their parents had confirmed it. And it wasn’t just one or two people 
who thought they remembered getting lost— a quarter of the participants did. These findings may sound unbelievable, but they actually reflect 
a very common experience. Our memories are sometimes unreliable. And though we still don’t know precisely
what causes this fallibility on a neurological level, research has highlighted some 
of the most common ways our memories diverge from what actually happened. The mall study highlights how we can
incorporate information from outside sources, like other people or the news, into our personal recollections
without realizing it. This kind of suggestibility is just 
one influence on our memories. Take another study, in which researchers briefly showed 
a random collection of photographs to a group of participants, including images of a university campus
none of them had ever visited. When shown the images three weeks later, a majority of participants said 
that they had probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. The participants misattributed information
from one context— an image they’d seen— onto another— a memory of something
they believed they actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown
an image of a magnifying glass, and then told to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw 
the magnifying glass and the lollipop. They struggled to link the objects 
to the correct context— whether they actually saw them,
or simply imagined them. Another study, where a psychologist 
questioned over 2,000 people on their views about the legalization 
of marijuana, highlights yet another kind 
of influence on memory. Participants answered questions 
in 1973 and 1982. Those who said they had supported
marijuana legalization in 1973, but reported they were against it in 1982, were more likely to recall that they were 
actually against legalization in 1973— bringing their old views in line 
with their current ones. Our current opinions,
feelings, and experiences can bias our memories 
of how we felt in the past. In another study, researchers gave two groups
of participants background information on a historical war and asked them to rate
the likelihood that each side would win. They gave each group the same information, except that they only told one group
who had actually won the war— the other group didn’t know 
the real world outcome. In theory, both groups’ answers 
should be similar, because the likelihood
of each side winning isn’t effected by who actually won— if there’s a 20% chance of thunderstorms,
and a thunderstorm happens, the chance of thunderstorms
doesn’t retroactively go up to 100%. Still, the group that knew 
how the war ended rated the winning side as more likely 
to win than the group who did not. All of these fallibilities of memory 
can have real-world impacts. If police interrogations use leading
questions with eye witnesses or suspects, suggestibility could result in incorrect 
identifications or unreliable confessions. Even in the absence of leading questions, misattribution can lead to inaccurate 
eyewitness testimony. In a courtroom, if a judge rules a piece of evidence 
inadmissible and tells jurors to disregard it,
they may not be able to do so. In a medical setting, if a patient 
seeks a second opinion and the second physician is aware 
of the first one’s diagnosis, that knowledge may bias their conclusion. Our memories are not ironclad 
representations of reality, but subjective perceptions. And there’s not necessarily
anything wrong with that— the problems arise when we treat
memory as fact, rather than accepting
this fundamental truth about the nature of our recollections.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not cover the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's still not a good match. Question 5 talks about the process that can lead to misconceptions, which is somewhat related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ, which discusses how people can misremember information. However, the question intent, options, and content are still quite different.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the outcome of the experiment where people were shown a magnifying glass and then imagined a lollipop, and how it relates to memory and perception.

Since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend generating new MCQs that cover the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Index: None (or 5, but with a very low confidence level)

**Transcript**:
In 1901, David Hänig published a paper that forever changed 
our understanding of taste. His research led to what we know 
today as the taste map: an illustration that divides the tongue 
into four separate areas. According to this map, receptors at the tip of our tongues
capture sweetness, bitterness 
is detected at the tongue’s base, and along the sides, receptors capture 
salty and sour sensations. Since its invention, the taste map 
has been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, 
is that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even 
an accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed 
but largely incorrect. So where do misconceptions 
like this come from, and what makes a fake fact 
so easy to believe? It’s true that the tongue map’s 
journey begins with David Hänig. As part of his dissertation 
at Leipzig University, Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across 
the tongue for the four basic flavors. Using sucrose for sweet, 
quinine sulfate for bitter, hydrochloric acid for sour, 
and salt for salty, Hänig applied these stimuli to compare 
differences in taste thresholds across a subject’s tongue. He hoped to better understand 
the physiological mechanisms that affected these four flavors, and his data suggested that sensitivity 
for each taste did in fact vary across the tongue. The maximum sensation for sweet 
was located at the tongue’s tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back;
salt was strongest in this area, and sour at the middle 
of the tongue’s sides. But Hänig was careful 
to note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue, and that the areas he identified offered 
very small variations in intensity. Like so many misconceptions, the tongue map represents a distortion 
of its original source, however the nature of that distortion 
can vary. Some misconceptions 
are comprised of disinformation— false information intentionally designed 
to mislead people. But many misconceptions, 
including the tongue map, center on misinformation—
false or misleading information that results from unintentional 
inaccuracy. Misinformation is most often shaped 
by mistakes and human error, but the specific mistakes 
that lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied. In the case of the tongue map, Hänig’s dissertation was written 
in German, meaning the paper could only be 
understood by readers fluent in German and well versed in Hanig’s 
small corner of academia. This kicked off a game of telephone 
that re-shaped Häing’s research every time it was shared 
with outside parties. Less than a decade after his dissertation, newspapers were falsely insisting 
that experiments could prove sweetness was imperceptible 
on the back of the tongue. The second culprit 
behind the tongue map’s spread were the images 
that Hänig’s work inspired. In 1912, a rough version of the map 
appeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described 
some of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. Featuring clear labels across the tongue,
the article’s illustration simplified Hänig’s more-complicated 
original diagrams. Variations of this approachable image 
became repeatedly cited, often without credit or nuanced 
consideration for Hänig’s work. Eventually this image spread 
to textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth 
of how we experience taste. But perhaps the factor that most 
contributed to this misconception was its narrative simplicity. In many ways, the map complements our desire for clear 
stories about the world around us— a quality not always present 
in the sometimes-messy fields of science. For example, even the number of tastes we have is more 
complicated than Hänig’s work suggests. Umami— also known as savory— 
is now considered the fifth basic taste, and many still debate 
the existence of tastes like fatty, alkaline, metallic, 
and water-like. Once we hear a good story, it can be difficult to change 
how we see that information, even in the face of new evidence. So, next time you see a convenient chart 
or read a surprising anecdote, try to maintain a healthy skepticism— because misconceptions 
can leave a bitter taste on every part of your tongue.

**Transcript**:
In 1901, David Hänig published a paper that forever changed 
our understanding of taste. His research led to what we know 
today as the taste map: an illustration that divides the tongue 
into four separate areas. According to this map, receptors at the tip of our tongues
capture sweetness, bitterness 
is detected at the tongue’s base, and along the sides, receptors capture 
salty and sour sensations. Since its invention, the taste map 
has been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, 
is that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even 
an accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed 
but largely incorrect. So where do misconceptions 
like this come from, and what makes a fake fact 
so easy to believe? It’s true that the tongue map’s 
journey begins with David Hänig. As part of his dissertation 
at Leipzig University, Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across 
the tongue for the four basic flavors. Using sucrose for sweet, 
quinine sulfate for bitter, hydrochloric acid for sour, 
and salt for salty, Hänig applied these stimuli to compare 
differences in taste thresholds across a subject’s tongue. He hoped to better understand 
the physiological mechanisms that affected these four flavors, and his data suggested that sensitivity 
for each taste did in fact vary across the tongue. The maximum sensation for sweet 
was located at the tongue’s tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back;
salt was strongest in this area, and sour at the middle 
of the tongue’s sides. But Hänig was careful 
to note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue, and that the areas he identified offered 
very small variations in intensity. Like so many misconceptions, the tongue map represents a distortion 
of its original source, however the nature of that distortion 
can vary. Some misconceptions 
are comprised of disinformation— false information intentionally designed 
to mislead people. But many misconceptions, 
including the tongue map, center on misinformation—
false or misleading information that results from unintentional 
inaccuracy. Misinformation is most often shaped 
by mistakes and human error, but the specific mistakes 
that lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied. In the case of the tongue map, Hänig’s dissertation was written 
in German, meaning the paper could only be 
understood by readers fluent in German and well versed in Hanig’s 
small corner of academia. This kicked off a game of telephone 
that re-shaped Häing’s research every time it was shared 
with outside parties. Less than a decade after his dissertation, newspapers were falsely insisting 
that experiments could prove sweetness was imperceptible 
on the back of the tongue. The second culprit 
behind the tongue map’s spread were the images 
that Hänig’s work inspired. In 1912, a rough version of the map 
appeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described 
some of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. Featuring clear labels across the tongue,
the article’s illustration simplified Hänig’s more-complicated 
original diagrams. Variations of this approachable image 
became repeatedly cited, often without credit or nuanced 
consideration for Hänig’s work. Eventually this image spread 
to textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth

**Transcript**:
In 1901, David Hänig published a paper that forever changed 
our understanding of taste. His research led to what we know 
today as the taste map: an illustration that divides the tongue 
into four separate areas. According to this map, receptors at the tip of our tongues
capture sweetness, bitterness 
is detected at the tongue’s base, and along the sides, receptors capture 
salty and sour sensations. Since its invention, the taste map 
has been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, 
is that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even 
an accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed 
but largely incorrect. So where do misconceptions 
like this come from, and what makes a fake fact 
so easy to believe? It’s true that the tongue map’s 
journey begins with David Hänig. As part of his dissertation 
at Leipzig University, Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across 
the tongue for the four basic flavors. Using sucrose for sweet, 
quinine sulfate for bitter, hydrochloric acid for sour, 
and salt for salty, Hänig applied these stimuli to compare 
differences in taste thresholds across a subject’s tongue. He hoped to better understand 
the physiological mechanisms that affected these four flavors, and his data suggested that sensitivity 
for each taste did in fact vary across the tongue. The maximum sensation for sweet 
was located at the tongue’s tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back;
salt was strongest in this area, and sour at the middle 
of the tongue’s sides. But Hänig was careful 
to note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue, and that the areas he identified offered 
very small variations in intensity. Like so many misconceptions, the tongue map represents a distortion 
of its original source, however the nature of that distortion 
can vary. Some misconceptions 
are comprised of disinformation— false information intentionally designed 
to mislead people. But many misconceptions, 
including the tongue map, center on misinformation—
false or misleading information that results from unintentional 
inaccuracy. Misinformation is most often shaped 
by mistakes and human error, but the specific mistakes 
that lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied. In the case of the tongue map, Hänig’s dissertation was written 
in German, meaning the paper could only be 
understood by readers fluent in German and well versed in Hanig’s 
small corner of academia. This kicked off a game of telephone 
that re-shaped Häing’s research every time it was shared 
with outside parties. Less than a decade after his dissertation, newspapers were falsely insisting 
that experiments could prove sweetness was imperceptible 
on the back of the tongue. The second culprit 
behind the tongue map’s spread were the images 
that Hänig’s work inspired. In 1912, a rough version of the map 
appeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described 
some of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. Featuring clear labels across the tongue,
the article’s illustration simplified Hänig’s more-complicated 
original diagrams. Variations of this approachable image 
became repeatedly cited, often without credit or nuanced 
consideration for Hänig’s work. Eventually this image spread 
to textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth 
of how we experience taste. But perhaps the factor that most 
contributed to this misconception was its narrative simplicity. In many ways, the map complements our desire for clear 
stories about the world around us— a quality not always present 
in the sometimes-messy fields of science. For example, even the number of tastes we have is more 
complicated than Hänig’s work suggests. Umami— also known as savory— 
is now considered the fifth basic taste, and many still debate 
the existence of tastes like fatty, alkaline, metallic, 
and water-like. Once we hear a good story, it can be difficult to change 
how we see that information, even in the face of new evidence. So, next time you see a convenient chart 
or read a surprising anecdote, try to maintain a healthy skepticism— because misconceptions 
can leave a bitter taste on every part of your tongue.

**Transcript**:
In the late 13th century, Osman I 
established a small beylik, or principality, in what is now Turkey. In just a few generations, this beylik
outmaneuvered more powerful neighbors to become the vast Ottoman empire. What enabled its rapid rise? In Osman’s time, the Anatolian peninsula
was a patchwork of Turkic principalities sandwiched between a crumbling
Byzantine Empire and weakened Sultanate
of the Seljuk of Rum. Osman quickly expanded this territory through a mixture of strategic
political alliances and military conflicts 
with these neighbors, attracting mercenaries first
with the promise of booty, then later through his reputation 
for winning. Osman was the first in a line 
of Ottoman rulers distinguished by their political shrewdness. Often prioritizing political and military
utility over ethnic or religious affinity, they expanded their influence by fighting
along certain sides when needed, and fighting against them 
when the time was right. After Osman’s death his son Orhan established a sophisticated military
organization and tax collection system geared towards funding 
quick territorial expansion. The Ottomans’ first major expansion
was in the Balkans, in southeast Europe. The military employed a mixture
of Turkic warriors and Byzantine and other Balkan Christian converts. They captured thousands 
of young Christian boys from villages from across the Balkans, converted them to Islam, and trained
them to become the backbone of a fierce military elite force
known as the Janissaries. The captured enslaved boys could rise
to the high position of a vizier in the Ottoman government. Rulers of conquered areas were
also allowed, even encouraged, to convert to Islam and take positions
in the Ottoman government. Meanwhile, non-Muslims 
who belonged to Abrahamic religions were allowed religious freedom 
in exchange for a tax known as Jizye, among other strict conditions— for example, they were not allowed
to join the army. By the end of the 14th century, 
the Ottomans had conquered or subordinated most of the Anatolian beyliks 
as well as the Balkans. But in the first half of the 15th century, as Sultan Beyazit I focused
on Western expansion, the Central Asian ruler Timur attacked
from the east. He captured Beyazit and carted
him off in an iron cage, sparking a ten year struggle 
for succession that almost destroyed the Ottoman empire. Sultan Murad II turned this trend around, but fell short of one 
of his loftiest goals: capturing the Byzantine capital,
Constantinople. His son, Sultan Mehmed II, 
or Mehmed the Conqueror, vowed to succeed where his father
had failed. In preparation for the attack 
on Constantinople, he hired a Hungarian engineer 
to forge the largest cannon in the world, used Serbian miners to dig tunnels
under the walls of the city, and ordered his fleet of ships
to be carried overland, attacking the city 
from an unexpected direction. He laid siege to the city 
and in the spring of 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. It would become the Ottoman capital, 
known by its common Greek name, Istanbul, meaning “to the city.” By the time Mehmed II
conquered Constantinople, the city was a shadow of its former glory. Under Ottoman rule, 
it flourished once again. On an average day in Istanbul, you could
hear people speaking Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Arabic, Bulgarian,
Albanian, and Serbian. Architects like the famous Sinan
filled the city with splendid mosques and other buildings commissioned
by the sultans. Through Istanbul, the Otttomans brought
commodities like coffee to Europe. They entered a golden age 
of economic growth, territorial acquisition, 
art and architecture. They brought together craftspeople 
from across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia to create
a unique blend of cultural innovation. Iznik ceramics, for example, were made using techniques
from China’s Ming dynasty, reimagined with Ottoman motifs. The Ottomans would continue to expand, cementing their political influence
and lucrative trade routes. The empire lasted for more than 600 years 
and, at its peak, stretched from Hungary
to the Persian Gulf, from the Horn of Africa
to the Crimean Peninsula.

**Transcript**:
In the late 13th century, Osman I 
established a small beylik, or principality, in what is now Turkey. In just a few generations, this beylik
outmaneuvered more powerful neighbors to become the vast Ottoman empire. What enabled its rapid rise? In Osman’s time, the Anatolian peninsula
was a patchwork of Turkic principalities sandwiched between a crumbling
Byzantine Empire and weakened Sultanate
of the Seljuk of Rum. Osman quickly expanded this territory through a mixture of strategic
political alliances and military conflicts 
with these neighbors, attracting mercenaries first
with the promise of booty, then later through his reputation 
for winning. Osman was the first in a line 
of Ottoman rulers distinguished by their political shrewdness. Often prioritizing political and military
utility over ethnic or religious affinity, they expanded their influence by fighting
along certain sides when needed, and fighting against them 
when the time was right. After Osman’s death his son Orhan established a sophisticated military
organization and tax collection system geared towards funding 
quick territorial expansion. The Ottomans’ first major expansion
was in the Balkans, in southeast Europe. The military employed a mixture
of Turkic warriors and Byzantine and other Balkan Christian converts. They captured thousands 
of young Christian boys from villages from across the Balkans, converted them to Islam, and trained
them to become the backbone of a fierce military elite force
known as the Janissaries. The captured enslaved boys could rise
to the high position of a vizier in the Ottoman government. Rulers of conquered areas were
also allowed, even encouraged, to convert to Islam and take positions
in the Ottoman government. Meanwhile, non-Muslims 
who belonged to Abrahamic religions were allowed religious freedom 
in exchange for a tax known as Jizye, among other strict conditions— for example, they were not allowed
to join the army. By the end of the 14th century, 
the Ottomans had conquered or subordinated most of the Anatolian beyliks 
as well as the Balkans. But in the first half of the 15th century, as Sultan Beyazit I focused
on Western expansion, the Central Asian ruler Timur attacked
from the east. He captured Beyazit and carted
him off in an iron cage, sparking a ten year struggle 
for succession that almost destroyed the Ottoman empire. Sultan Murad II turned this trend around, but fell short of one 
of his loftiest goals: capturing the Byzantine capital,
Constantinople. His son, Sultan Mehmed II, 
or Mehmed the Conqueror, vowed to succeed where his father
had failed. In preparation for the attack 
on Constantinople, he hired a Hungarian engineer 
to forge the largest cannon in the world, used Serbian miners to dig tunnels
under the walls of the city, and ordered his fleet of ships
to be carried overland, attacking the city 
from an unexpected direction. He laid siege to the city 
and in the spring of 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. It would become the Ottoman capital, 
known by its common Greek name, Istanbul, meaning “to the city.” By the time Mehmed II
conquered Constantinople, the city was a shadow of its former glory. Under Ottoman rule, 
it flourished once again. On an average day in Istanbul, you could
hear people speaking Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Arabic, Bulgarian,
Albanian, and Serbian. Architects like the famous Sinan
filled the city with splendid mosques and other buildings commissioned
by the sultans. Through Istanbul, the Otttomans brought
commodities like coffee to Europe. They entered a golden age 
of economic growth, territorial acquisition, 
art and architecture. They brought together craftspeople 
from across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia to create
a unique blend of cultural innovation. Iznik ceramics, for example, were made using techniques
from China’s Ming dynasty, reimagined with Ottoman motifs. The Ottomans would continue to expand, cementing their political influence
and lucrative trade routes. The empire lasted for more than 600 years 
and, at its peak, stretched from Hungary
to the Persian Gulf, from the Horn of Africa
to the Crimean Peninsula.

**Transcript**:
Princess Savitri of the Madra Kingdom
was as benevolent, brilliant, and bright as the Sun God she was named for. Her grace was known throughout the land, and many powerful princes and wealthy
merchants flocked to her family’s palace to seek her hand in marriage. But upon witnessing her blinding splendor
in person, the men lost their nerve. Unimpressed with these suitors, the princess determined
to find a husband herself. Mounting her golden chariot, 
she travelled through rolling deserts, glittering cities 
and snow-capped mountains— rejecting many men along the way. Eventually, Savitri ventured 
deep into the jungle, where she met a young man 
chopping wood. His name was Satyavan, and like her,
he loved the tranquil forest— but the princess saw he was not at peace. After talking for hours, Satyavan told
her of his plight. His parents had once been wealthy rulers, until his father was blinded 
and overthrown in a violent coup. Now Satyavan worked tirelessly 
to support their meager new life. His determination and devotion
moved the princess. As they gazed into each other’s eyes,
she knew she’d finally found an equal. Savitri rushed home to tell
her father the good news, only to find him conversing with Narada a traveling sage and wisest messenger 
of the Gods. At first her father was thrilled
to learn of Satyavan, but Narada revealed a tragic prophecy:
her betrothed had only a year to live. Savitri’s blood ran cold. She’d waited so long to find her partner—
was she already doomed to lose him? The princess would not accept these terms. She swore before Narada, her family, and Savitr himself that she would
never marry another. Satyavan was her one true love,
and their fates were entwined forever. Moved by her powerful words, the sage told the princess to follow
an ancient spiritual regimen. With regular prayer, periods of fasting, and preparation of special
herbs and plants, she might be able to prolong
Satyavan’s life. After a simple wedding, the couple
returned to the jungle to live in keeping with the sage’s instructions. This modest existence was a far cry
from her lavish upbringing, but they were happy in each other’s
company. A year passed, and the fated day arrived. On their first anniversary, 
the sun grew horribly hot, and Satyavan’s brow began to burn, Savitri barely had time to drag 
him into the shade, before he grew still and cold. Through her tears, the princess
saw an immense figure on the horizon. This was Yamraj, the God of Death, come to escort Satyavan’s soul 
to the afterlife. But Savitri was not giving up yet. She followed the god for hours
in the beating sun. Yamraj thundered at the princess
to leave him in peace. But even as her feet bled and throat
burned, Savitri would not turn back. Eventually, Yamraj paused. He would grant her one wish 
as reward for her persistence, but she couldn’t ask
for her husband’s life. Without hesitating, Savitri asked the God 
to restore her father in-law’s sight. The wish was granted, and Yamraj rode on. But still Savitri’s footsteps
echoed behind him. Exasperated, the God granted
her a second wish. This time, she asked for Satyavan’s
kingdom to be restored. Again the wish was granted, and Yamraj began his descent 
into his subterranean kingdom. But when he glanced back, he was astounded to see 
the bedraggled princess stumbling along. He’d never seen such devotion to the dead, and he honored her dedication
with one final wish. Savitri wished to be the mother
of many children. The God agreed, and waved to dismiss her. But the princess only repeated the vow
she’d made one year earlier: her fate was forever entwined
with Satyavan. How could she bear many children,
if Yamraj would not return her husband? Hearing this clever question the god
relented, knowing he’d been beaten. With Yamraj’s blessing and respect,
Satyavan was returned to Savitri, and the two walked back 
to the land of the living, united in a love that not even
death could destroy.

her father the good news, only to find him conversing with Narada a traveling sage and wisest messenger 
of the Gods. At first her father was thrilled
to learn of Satyavan, but Narada revealed a tragic prophecy:
her betrothed had only a year to live. Savitri’s blood ran cold. She’d waited so long to find her partner—
was she already doomed to lose him? The princess would not accept these terms. She swore before Narada, her family, and Savitr himself that she would
never marry another. Satyavan was her one true love,
and their fates were entwined forever. Moved by her powerful words, the sage told the princess to follow
an ancient spiritual regimen. With regular prayer, periods of fasting, and preparation of special
herbs and plants, she might be able to prolong
Satyavan’s life. After a simple wedding, the couple
returned to the jungle to live in keeping with the sage’s instructions. This modest existence was a far cry
from her lavish upbringing, but they were happy in each other’s
company. A year passed, and the fated day arrived. On their first anniversary, 
the sun grew horribly hot, and Satyavan’s brow began to burn, Savitri barely had time to drag 
him into the shade, before he grew still and cold. Through her tears, the princess
saw an immense figure on the horizon. This was Yamraj, the God of Death, come to escort Satyavan’s soul 
to the afterlife. But Savitri was not giving up yet. She followed the god for hours
in the beating sun. Yamraj thundered at the princess
to leave him in peace. But even as her feet bled and throat
burned, Savitri would not turn back. Eventually, Yamraj paused. He would grant her one wish 
as reward for her persistence, but she couldn’t ask
for her husband’s life. Without hesitating, Savitri asked the God 
to restore her father in-law’s sight. The wish was granted, and Yamraj rode on. But still Savitri’s footsteps
echoed behind him. Exasperated, the God granted
her a second wish. This time, she asked for Satyavan’s
kingdom to be restored. Again the wish was granted, and Yamraj began his descent 
into his subterranean kingdom. But when he glanced back, he was astounded to see 
the bedraggled princess stumbling along. He’d never seen such devotion to the dead, and he honored her dedication
with one final wish. Savitri wished to be the mother
of many children. The God agreed, and waved to dismiss her. But the princess only repeated the vow
she’d made one year earlier: her fate was forever entwined
with Satyavan. How could she bear many children,
if Yamraj would not return her husband? Hearing this clever question the god
relented, knowing he’d been beaten. With Yamraj’s blessing and respect,
Satyavan was returned to Savitri, and the two walked back 
to the land of the living, united in a love that not even
death could destroy.

**Transcript**:
Princess Savitri of the Madra Kingdom
was as benevolent, brilliant, and bright as the Sun God she was named for. Her grace was known throughout the land, and many powerful princes and wealthy
merchants flocked to her family’s palace to seek her hand in marriage. But upon witnessing her blinding splendor
in person, the men lost their nerve. Unimpressed with these suitors, the princess determined
to find a husband herself. Mounting her golden chariot, 
she travelled through rolling deserts, glittering cities 
and snow-capped mountains— rejecting many men along the way. Eventually, Savitri ventured 
deep into the jungle, where she met a young man 
chopping wood. His name was Satyavan, and like her,
he loved the tranquil forest— but the princess saw he was not at peace. After talking for hours, Satyavan told
her of his plight. His parents had once been wealthy rulers, until his father was blinded 
and overthrown in a violent coup. Now Satyavan worked tirelessly 
to support their meager new life. His determination and devotion
moved the princess. As they gazed into each other’s eyes,
she knew she’d finally found an equal. Savitri rushed home to tell

**Transcript**:
How many people does it take to make
a cup of coffee? For many of us, all it takes is a short
walk and a quick pour. But this simple staple is the result 
of a globe-spanning process whose cost and complexity are far greater
than you might imagine. It begins in a place like the remote
Colombian town of Pitalito. Here, family farms have clear cut 
local forests to make room for neat rows of Coffea trees. These shrub-like plants 
were first domesticated in Ethiopia and are now cultivated throughout
equatorial regions. Each shrub is filled with small berries
called "coffee cherries." Since fruits on the same branch 
can ripen at different times, they’re best picked by hand, but each farm has its own method
for processing the fruit. In Pitalito, harvesters toil 
from dawn to dusk at high altitudes, often picking over 25 kilograms per shift
for very low wages. The workers deliver their picked cherries
to the wet mill. This machine separates the seeds
from the fruit, and then sorts them by density. The heaviest, most flavorful seeds 
sink to the bottom of the mill, where they’re collected 
and taken to ferment in a tub of water for one or two days. Then, workers wash off the remaining fruit
and put the seeds out to dry. Some farms use machines for this process, but in Pitalito, seeds are spread
onto large mesh racks. Over the next three weeks, 
workers rake the seeds regularly to ensure they dry evenly. Once the coffee beans are dry, a truck takes them to a nearby mill
with several specialized machines. An air blower re-sorts the seeds 
by density, an assortment of sieves filter 
them by size, and an optical scanner sorts by color. At this point, professionals called
Q-graders select samples of beans to roast and brew. In a process called "cupping," 
they evaluate the coffee’s taste, aroma, and mouthfeel to determine its quality. These experts give the beans a grade,
and get them ready to ship. Workers load burlap sacks 
containing up to 70 kilograms of dried and sorted coffee beans
onto steel shipping containers, each able to carry 
up to 21 metric tons of coffee. From tropical ports, cargo ships 
crewed by over 25 people transport coffee around the world But no country imports more coffee
than the United States, with New York City alone consuming
millions of cups every day. After the long journey 
from Colombia to New Jersey, our coffee beans pass through customs. Once dockworkers unload the container, a fleet of eighteen-wheelers transport 
the coffee to a nearby warehouse, and then to a roastery. Here the beans go into a roasting machine,
stirred by a metallic arm and heated by a gas-powered fire. Nearby sensors monitor the coffee’s
moisture level, chemical stability, and temperature, while trained coffee
engineers manually adjust these levels throughout the twelve-minute
roasting cycle. This process releases oil within the seed, transforming the seeds into grindable,
brewable beans with a dark brown color and rich aroma. After roasting, workers pack the beans
into five-pound bags, which a fleet of vans deliver to cafes
and stores across the city. The coffee is now so close 
you can smell it, but it needs more help 
for the final stretch. Each coffee company has a head buyer who carefully selects beans 
from all over the world. Logistics teams manage 
bean delivery routes, and brave baristas across the city
serve this caffeinated elixir to scores of hurried customers. All in all, it takes hundreds of people
to get coffee to its intended destination— and that’s not counting everyone
maintaining the infrastructure that makes the journey possible. Many of these individuals work 
for low pay in dangerous conditions— and some aren’t paid at all. So while we might marvel at the global
network behind this commodity, let’s make sure we don’t value 
the final product more than the people who make it.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 3, Ground Truth Question 3, Matched Generated Question 6
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

**Transcript**:
How many people does it take to make
a cup of coffee? For many of us, all it takes is a short
walk and a quick pour. But this simple staple is the result 
of a globe-spanning process whose cost and complexity are far greater
than you might imagine. It begins in a place like the remote
Colombian town of Pitalito. Here, family farms have clear cut 
local forests to make room for neat rows of Coffea trees. These shrub-like plants 
were first domesticated in Ethiopia and are now cultivated throughout
equatorial regions. Each shrub is filled with small berries
called "coffee cherries." Since fruits on the same branch 
can ripen at different times, they’re best picked by hand, but each farm has its own method
for processing the fruit. In Pitalito, harvesters toil 
from dawn to dusk at high altitudes, often picking over 25 kilograms per shift
for very low wages. The workers deliver their picked cherries
to the wet mill. This machine separates the seeds
from the fruit, and then sorts them by density. The heaviest, most flavorful seeds 
sink to the bottom of the mill, where they’re collected 
and taken to ferment in a tub of water for one or two days. Then, workers wash off the remaining fruit
and put the seeds out to dry. Some farms use machines for this process, but in Pitalito, seeds are spread
onto large mesh racks. Over the next three weeks, 
workers rake the seeds regularly to ensure they dry evenly. Once the coffee beans are dry, a truck takes them to a nearby mill
with several specialized machines. An air blower re-sorts the seeds 
by density, an assortment of sieves filter 
them by size, and an optical scanner sorts by color. At this point, professionals called
Q-graders select samples of beans to roast and brew. In a process called "cupping," 
they evaluate the coffee’s taste, aroma, and mouthfeel to determine its quality. These experts give the beans a grade,
and get them ready to ship. Workers load burlap sacks 
containing up to 70 kilograms of dried and sorted coffee beans
onto steel shipping containers, each able to carry 
up to 21 metric tons of coffee. From tropical ports, cargo ships 
crewed by over 25 people transport coffee around the world But no country imports more coffee
than the United States, with New York City alone consuming
millions of cups every day. After the long journey 
from Colombia to New Jersey, our coffee beans pass through customs. Once dockworkers unload the container, a fleet of eighteen-wheelers transport 
the coffee to a nearby warehouse, and then to a roastery. Here the beans go into a roasting machine,
stirred by a metallic arm and heated by a gas-powered fire. Nearby sensors monitor the coffee’s
moisture level, chemical stability, and temperature, while trained coffee
engineers manually adjust these levels throughout the twelve-minute
roasting cycle. This process releases oil within the seed, transforming the seeds into grindable,
brewable beans with a dark brown color and rich aroma. After roasting, workers pack the beans
into five-pound bags, which a fleet of vans deliver to cafes
and stores across the city. The coffee is now so close 
you can smell it, but it needs more help 
for the final stretch. Each coffee company has a head buyer who carefully selects beans 
from all over the world. Logistics teams manage 
bean delivery routes, and brave baristas across the city
serve this caffeinated elixir to scores of hurried customers. All in all, it takes hundreds of people
to get coffee to its intended destination— and that’s not counting everyone
maintaining the infrastructure that makes the journey possible. Many of these individuals work 
for low pay in dangerous conditions— and some aren’t paid at all. So while we might marvel at the global
network behind this commodity, let’s make sure we don’t value 
the final product more than the people who make it.

**Transcript**:
In 1942, a mother-daughter duo Katherine Cook Briggs
and Isabel Briggs Myers developed a questionnaire that classified
people’s personalities into 16 types. Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,
or MBTI, it would go on to become one of the world’s 
most widely-used personality tests. Today, personality testing 
is a multi-billion dollar industry used by individuals, schools,
and companies. But none of these tests, including 
the MBTI, the Big Five, the DiSC assessment, 
the Process Communication Model, and the Enneagram, actually reveal truths about personality. In fact, it’s up for debate 
whether personality is a stable, measurable feature 
of an individual at all. Part of the problem is the way the tests
are constructed. Each is based on a different set 
of metrics to define personality: the Myers-Briggs, for instance, focuses on features like introversion 
and extroversion to classify people into
personality "types," while the Big Five scores participants
on five different traits. Most are self-reported, meaning the results are based on questions
participants answer about themselves. So it’s easy to lie, but even with 
the best intentions, objective self-evaluation is tricky. Take this question from the Big Five: How would you rate the accuracy
of the statement "I am always prepared"? There’s a clear favorable answer here,
which makes it difficult to be objective. People subconsciously aim to please: when asked to agree or disagree,
we show a bias toward answering however we believe 
the person or institution asking the question wants us to answer. Here’s another question— what do you value more, 
justice or fairness? What about harmony or forgiveness? You may well value both sides 
of each pair, but the MBTI would force 
you to choose one. And while it’s tempting to assume 
the results of that forced choice must somehow reveal a true preference,
they don’t: When faced with the same forced choice
question multiple times, the same person will sometimes
change their answer. Given these design flaws, it’s no surprise
that test results can be inconsistent. One study found that nearly half of people
who take the Myers-Briggs a second time only five weeks after the first
get assigned a different type. And other studies on the Myers-Briggs have
found that people with very similar scores end up being placed 
in different categories, suggesting that the strict divisions
between personality types don’t reflect real-life nuances. Complicating matters further, the definitions of personality traits 
are constantly shifting. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who popularized the terms
introvert and extrovert, defined an introvert as someone who sticks
to their principles regardless of situation, and an extrovert as someone who molds
their self according to circumstance. Introversion later came to mean shyness,
while an extrovert was someone outgoing. Today, an introvert is someone who finds
alone time restorative, an extrovert draws energy 
from social interaction, and an ambivert falls somewhere
between these two extremes. The notion of an innate, 
unchanging personality forms the basis of all these tests. But research increasingly suggests that
personality shifts during key periods— like our school years,
or when we start working. Though certain features 
of a person’s behavior may remain relatively stable over time, others are malleable, moulded by our
upbringing, life experiences, and age. All of this matters more or less depending
on how a personality test is used. Though anyone using them should take
the results with a grain of salt, there isn’t much harm in individual use— and users may even learn some 
new terms and concepts in the process. But the use of personality tests extends
far beyond self discovery. Schools use them to advise students
what to study and what jobs to pursue. Companies use them decide who to hire
and for what positions. Yet the results don’t predict how a person
will perform in a specific role. So by using personality tests this way, institutions can deprive people 
of opportunities they’d excel at, or discourage them from considering 
certain paths.

**Transcript**:
It was about two years
after Hurricane Katrina that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps. These flood maps are used
to show land loss in the past and land loss that is to come. On this particular day,
at a community meeting, these maps were used to explain how a 30-foot tidal surge
that accompanied Hurricane Katrina could flood communities like mine
in south Louisiana and communities across
the Mississippi and Alabama coast. It turns out that the land we were losing
was our buffer from the sea. I volunteered to interact
with the graphics on the wall, and in an instant my life changed
for the second time in two years. The graphic showed
massive land loss in south Louisiana and an encroaching sea, but more specifically, the graphic showed
the disappearance of my community and many other communities
before the end of the century. I wasn't alone at the front of the room. I was standing there with other members
of south Louisiana's communities -- black, Native, poor. We thought we were just bound
by temporary disaster recovery, but we found that we were now bound
by the impossible task of ensuring that our communities
would not be erased by sea level rise due to climate change. Friends, neighbors, family, my community: I just assumed it would always be there. Land, trees, marsh, bayous: I just assumed that it would be there
as it had been for thousands of years. I was wrong. To understand what was happening
to my community, I had to talk to other communities
around the globe. I started in south Louisiana
with the United Houma Nation. I talked to youth advocates
in Shishmaref, Alaska. I talked to fisherwomen
in coastal Vietnam, justice fighters in Fiji, new generations of leaders in the ancient cultures
of the Torres Straits. Communities that had been here
for thousands of years were suffering the same fate, and we were all contemplating
how we would survive the next 50. By the end of the next century, it's predicted that
more than 180 million people will be displaced due to climate change, and in south Louisiana, those who can afford to do so
are already moving. They're moving because
south Louisiana is losing land at one of the fastest rates on the planet. Disappearance is what my bayou community has in common with
other coastal communities. Erasure is what communities
around the globe are fighting as we get real about
the impacts of climate change. I've spent the last 14 years
advocating on behalf of communities that have been directly impacted
by the climate crisis. These communities
are fighting discrimination within climate disaster recovery, and they're also trying to balance
mass displacement of people with an influx of others who see opportunity in starting anew. Since 2005, people
have been called "refugees" when they leave when they're displaced
by climate disaster, even when they don't cross
international borders. These terms, these misused terms, that are meant to identify the other, the victim, the person who is not supposed to be here, these terms are barriers to economic recovery, to social integration and to the healing required from
the climate crisis and climate trauma. Words matter. It also matters how we treat
people who are crossing borders. We should care about how people
who are crossing borders today to seek refuge and safety
are being treated, if for no other reason than it might
be you or someone you love who needs to exercise
their human right to migrate in the nearby future. We must start preparing
for global migration today. It's a reality now. Our cities and our communities
are not prepared. In fact, our economic system
and our social systems are only prepared to make profit
off of people who migrate. This will cause rounds
of climate gentrification, and it will also penalize
the movement of people, usually through exploited labor and usually through criminalization. Climate gentrification that happens
in anticipation of sea level rise is what we're seeing in places like Miami, where communities
that were kept from the waterfront are now being priced out
of the high ground where they were placed originally as people move away from the coast. These folks are being moved,
forced to relocate away from the social and economic systems
that they need to survive. Climate gentrification also happens
in the aftermath of climate disaster. When massive amounts
of people leave a location for an indefinite amount of time, we see others come in. We also see climate gentrification happen when damaged homes are now "green built," but now have a higher value, generally outside of the reach
of black and brown and poor people who want to return home. The price difference in rents
or the ownership of a house is the difference between
being able to practice your right, your human right
to return home as a community, or be forced to resettle somewhere else less climate resilient, less expensive and alone. The climate crisis
is a much larger conversation than reducing CO2 emissions, and it is a much different conversation
than just extreme weather. We're facing a shift
in every aspect of our global reality. And climate migration
is just one small part, but it's going to have ripple effects in both coastal cities
and cities in the interior. So what do we do? I have a few ideas. (Laughter) First, we must reframe
our understanding of the problem. Climate change is not the problem. Climate change
is the most horrible symptom of an economic system that has been built for a few to extract every precious value
out of this planet and its people, from our natural resources to the fruits of our human labor. This system has created this crisis. (Applause) We must have the courage
to admit we've taken too much. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the entire world is paying a price for the privilege and comfort
of just a few people on the planet. It's time for us to make
society-wide changes to a system that incentivizes consumption to the point of global imbalance. Our social, political and economic
systems of extraction must be transformed into systems
that regenerate the earth and advance human liberty globally. It is arrogance to think
that technology will save us. It is ego to think that we can continue this unjust and extractive approach
to living on this planet and survive. (Applause) To survive this next phase
of our human existence, we will need to restructure
our social and economic systems to develop our collective resilience. The social restructuring must be
towards restoration and repair of the earth and the communities
that have been extracted from, criminalized and targeted for generations. These are the frontlines. This is where we start. We must establish a new social attitude
to see migration as a benefit, a necessity for our global survival, not as a threat
to our individual privilege. Collective resilience means developing
cities that can receive people and provide housing, food, water, health care and the freedom from overpolicing for everyone, no matter who they are, no matter where they're from. What would it mean if we started
to plan for climate migration now? Sprawling cities or declining cities
could see this as an opportunity to rebuild a social infrastructure
rooted in justice and fairness. We could actually put money
into public hospitals and help them prepare for what is to come
through climate migration, including the trauma
that comes with loss and relocation. We can invest more of our time in justice, but it cannot be for temporary gain, it cannot be to help budget shortfalls, it has to be for long-term change and it has to be to advance justice. It's already possible, y'all. After Hurricane Katrina, universities and high schools
around the US took in students to help them finish their semester
or their year without missing a beat. Those students are now
productive assets in our community, and this is what our communities,
our businesses and our institutions need to get ready for now. The time is now. So as we reframe the problem
in a more truthful way and we restructure our social systems
in a more just way, all that will be left is for us
to reindigenize ourselves and to conjure a power
of the most ancient kind. This necessarily means
that we must learn to follow -- not tokenize, not exotify, not dismiss -- the leadership and
the traditional knowledge of a particular local place. It means that we must commit
to standards of ecological equity and climate justice and human rights as the basis, a base standard, a starting point, for where our new society is to go. All of this requires us to recognize
a power greater than ourselves and a life longer
than the ones we will live. It requires us to believe in the things
that we are privileged enough not to have to see. We must honor the rights of nature. We must advance human rights for all. We must transform from a disposable, individual society into one that sees our collective,
long-term humanity, or else we will not make it. We must see that even the best of us
are entangled in an unjust system, and we must acknowledge that the only way you're going to survive is for us to figure out how to reach a shared liberation together. The good news is we come from powerful people. We come from those who have,
in one way or another, survived so far to be us here today. This is reason enough to fight. And take it from
your south Louisiana friend, those hardest fights
are the ones to celebrate. Let's choose to make this next phase
of our planetary existence beautiful, and while we're at it, let's make it just and fair for everyone. We can do this, y'all. We can do this, because we must. We must, or else we lose our planet and we lose ourselves. The work starts here. The work starts together. This is my offering. Thank you for receiving it. Merci. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
In 2018, a single power plant 
produced more energy than the world’s largest coal-powered
and gas-powered plants combined. And rather than using finite fossil fuels, this massively powerful plant relied on
a time-tested source of renewable energy: running water. Stretching over 2.3 kilometers, China’s Three Gorges Dam isn’t just 
the world’s largest hydroelectric plant. It’s capable of producing more energy
than any other power plant on Earth. So what allows Three Gorges 
to generate all this power? And how do hydroelectric plants
work in the first place? A hydroelectric dam is essentially 
a massive gate, which redirects a river’s natural flow
through a large pipe called a penstock. Rushing water flows through the penstock
and turns the blades of a turbine, which is attached to a generator
in an adjacent power station. The turning of the blades spins coils
of wire inside a magnetic field, producing a steady supply of electricity. Because the penstocks can be sealed
at any time, a dam can hold back excess water
during stormy seasons, and save it for dry ones. This allows hydroelectric dams 
to produce power regardless of the weather, while simultaneously preventing
floods further downstream. These benefits have long appealed 
to China’s Hubei Province. Located near the basin
of the Yangtze River, this region is prone to deadly floods
during rainy seasons when the Yangtze’s flow is strongest. Plans to build a dam that would
transform this volatile waterway into a stable source of power circulated
throughout the 20th century. When construction finally began in 1994
the plans were epic. The dam would contain 32 turbines—
12 more than the previous record holder, South America’s Itaipu Dam. The turbines would supply energy 
to two separate power stations, each connecting to a series of cables
spanning hundreds of kilometers. Electricity from Three Gorges would
reach power grids as far away as Shanghai. However, the human costs 
of this ambition were steep. To create the dam’s reservoir, workers needed to flood over 
600 square kilometers of land upstream. This area included 13 cities, 
hundreds of villages, and over 1,000 historical
and archaeological sites. The construction displaced roughly
1.4 million people, and the government’s relocation programs
were widely considered insufficient. Many argued against this controversial
construction, but others estimated that the lives
saved by the dam’s flood protection would outweigh the trauma 
of displacement. Furthermore, raising the water level
upstream would improve the river’s navigability, increase shipping capacity,
and transform the region into a collection 
of prosperous port towns. When the project was completed in 2012, China became the world’s largest
producer of electricity. In 2018, the dam generated 101.6 billion
kilowatt-hours. That’s enough electricity to power 
nearly 2% of China for one year; or to power New York City 
for almost two years. This is a truly astonishing amount
of energy. And yet, two years earlier, 
another dam less than half the size actually generated more electricity. Despite Three Gorges record-setting scale,
the Itaipu Dam still produced more power. To understand why Itaipu can outperform
Three Gorges, we need to look at the two factors
that determine a dam’s energy output. The first is the number of turbines. Three Gorges has the world’s highest
installed turbine capacity, meaning it’s theoretically capable 
of producing over 50% more power than Itaipu. But the second factor is the force 
and frequency of water moving through those turbines. Three Gorges spans several deep, narrow
ravines surging with powerful water. However, the Yangtze’s seasonal changes
keep the dam from reaching its theoretical maximum output. The Itaipu Dam, on the other hand, is located atop what was previously
the planet’s largest waterfall by volume. Although the dam’s construction destroyed
this natural wonder, the constant flow of water allows Itaipu to consistently generate more
power each year. This dam rivalry is far from over, and other projects like the Inga Falls Dam
in the Democratic Republic of Congo are also vying for the title 
of most powerful power plant. But whatever the future holds,
governments will need to ensure that a power plant’s environmental
and human impact are as sustainable as the energy
it produces.

and archaeological sites. The construction displaced roughly
1.4 million people, and the government’s relocation programs
were widely considered insufficient. Many argued against this controversial
construction, but others estimated that the lives
saved by the dam’s flood protection would outweigh the trauma 
of displacement. Furthermore, raising the water level
upstream would improve the river’s navigability, increase shipping capacity,
and transform the region into a collection 
of prosperous port towns. When the project was completed in 2012, China became the world’s largest
producer of electricity. In 2018, the dam generated 101.6 billion
kilowatt-hours. That’s enough electricity to power 
nearly 2% of China for one year; or to power New York City 
for almost two years. This is a truly astonishing amount
of energy. And yet, two years earlier, 
another dam less than half the size actually generated more electricity. Despite Three Gorges record-setting scale,
the Itaipu Dam still produced more power. To understand why Itaipu can outperform
Three Gorges, we need to look at the two factors
that determine a dam’s energy output. The first is the number of turbines. Three Gorges has the world’s highest
installed turbine capacity, meaning it’s theoretically capable 
of producing over 50% more power than Itaipu. But the second factor is the force 
and frequency of water moving through those turbines. Three Gorges spans several deep, narrow
ravines surging with powerful water. However, the Yangtze’s seasonal changes
keep the dam from reaching its theoretical maximum output. The Itaipu Dam, on the other hand, is located atop what was previously
the planet’s largest waterfall by volume. Although the dam’s construction destroyed
this natural wonder, the constant flow of water allows Itaipu to consistently generate more
power each year. This dam rivalry is far from over, and other projects like the Inga Falls Dam
in the Democratic Republic of Congo are also vying for the title 
of most powerful power plant. But whatever the future holds,
governments will need to ensure that a power plant’s environmental
and human impact are as sustainable as the energy
it produces.

**Transcript**:
In 2018, a single power plant 
produced more energy than the world’s largest coal-powered
and gas-powered plants combined. And rather than using finite fossil fuels, this massively powerful plant relied on
a time-tested source of renewable energy: running water. Stretching over 2.3 kilometers, China’s Three Gorges Dam isn’t just 
the world’s largest hydroelectric plant. It’s capable of producing more energy
than any other power plant on Earth. So what allows Three Gorges 
to generate all this power? And how do hydroelectric plants
work in the first place? A hydroelectric dam is essentially 
a massive gate, which redirects a river’s natural flow
through a large pipe called a penstock. Rushing water flows through the penstock
and turns the blades of a turbine, which is attached to a generator
in an adjacent power station. The turning of the blades spins coils
of wire inside a magnetic field, producing a steady supply of electricity. Because the penstocks can be sealed
at any time, a dam can hold back excess water
during stormy seasons, and save it for dry ones. This allows hydroelectric dams 
to produce power regardless of the weather, while simultaneously preventing
floods further downstream. These benefits have long appealed 
to China’s Hubei Province. Located near the basin
of the Yangtze River, this region is prone to deadly floods
during rainy seasons when the Yangtze’s flow is strongest. Plans to build a dam that would
transform this volatile waterway into a stable source of power circulated
throughout the 20th century. When construction finally began in 1994
the plans were epic. The dam would contain 32 turbines—
12 more than the previous record holder, South America’s Itaipu Dam. The turbines would supply energy 
to two separate power stations, each connecting to a series of cables
spanning hundreds of kilometers. Electricity from Three Gorges would
reach power grids as far away as Shanghai. However, the human costs 
of this ambition were steep. To create the dam’s reservoir, workers needed to flood over 
600 square kilometers of land upstream. This area included 13 cities, 
hundreds of villages, and over 1,000 historical
and archaeological sites. The construction displaced roughly
1.4 million people, and the government’s relocation programs

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have
unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive
about politics or religion, childcare, food? (Laughter) And how many of you
know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want
to talk to them? (Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order
to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice
of Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change
and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- (Laughter) are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential
to devolve into an argument, where our politicians
can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately
for it and against it, it's not normal. Pew Research did a study
of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment,
we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're
not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even
who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means
we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance
between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way,
we lost that balance. Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all
either have in your hands or close enough that you could
grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers
send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them,
are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk
to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher
named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids
a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak
on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: “I came to realize...” (Laughter) "I came to realize
that conversational competence might be the single
most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging
with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal
communications skills. It might sound like a funny question,
but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain
coherent, confident conversation?" Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like.
I talk to people that I don’t like. I talk to some people that I disagree with
deeply on a personal level. But I still have
a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. Many of you have already heard
a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics
to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show
that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard
or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap. (Laughter) There is no reason to learn
how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I actually use the exact
same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you
how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you
learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time,
without getting bored, and, please God,
without offending anybody. We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before.
We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you
walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel
like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions
can't be like that. So I have 10 basic rules.
I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose
one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations. Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean
just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys
or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument
you had with your boss. Don't think about what
you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out
of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it
and half out of it. Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response
or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog. (Laughter) Now, there's a really good reason
why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to
hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations
and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation
assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires
a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means
setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become
less and less vulnerable and more and more likely
to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have
something to learn. Bill Nye: "Everyone you will ever meet
knows something that you don't." I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something. Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who,
what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question,
you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, "Were you terrified?" you're going to respond to the most
powerful word in that sentence, which is "terrified," and the answer is
"Yes, I was" or "No, I wasn't." "Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry." Let them describe it.
They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like,
"What was that like?" "How did that feel?" Because then they might have to stop
for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get
a much more interesting response. Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts
will come into your mind and you need to let them
go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking
for several minutes and then the host comes back in
and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere,
or it's already been answered. That means the host probably
stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought
of this really clever question, and he was just bound
and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having
a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time
that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. (Laughter) And we stop listening. Stories and ideas
are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. Number five: If you don't know,
say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio,
especially on NPR, are much more aware
that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful
about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap. Number six: Don't equate
your experience with theirs. If they're talking
about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time
you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble
they're having at work, don't tell them about
how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly,
it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment
to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once
what his IQ was, and he said, "I have no idea. People who brag
about their IQs are losers." (Laughter) Conversations are not
a promotional opportunity. Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending,
and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations
or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it
over and over. Don't do that. Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling
to come up with in your mind. They don't care.
What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. Number nine: This is not the last one,
but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many
really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most,
the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, "If your mouth is open,
you're not learning." And Calvin Coolidge said, "No man
ever listened his way out of a job." (Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything
I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks
at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to
500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in
those other 275 words. And look, I know,
it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that,
you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out
barely related sentences in the same place. (Laughter) You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, "Most of us don't listen
with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply." One more rule, number 10,
and it’s this one: Be brief. Be interested in other people. You know, I grew up
with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual 
in my home. People would come over
to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave,
my mother would come over to us, and she’d say, 
“Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize.
He's a Russian ballet dancer." And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden,
amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think
it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut
as often as I possibly can. I keep my mind open. And I’m always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly,
be prepared to be amazed. Thanks. (Applause)

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Baldur— son of All Father Odin 
and Queen Frigg, husband of Nanna the Peaceful, 
and God of truth and light— was the gentlest and most beloved being 
in all of Asgard. In his great hall of Breidablik, Baldur’s soothing presence 
eased his subject’s woes. But lately, he was plagued 
by troubles of his own. Every night, Baldur had gruesome visions 
foretelling his own imminent death. Determined to protect her son 
from these grim prophecies, Queen Frigg travelled 
across the nine realms, begging all living things 
not to harm Baldur. Her grace moved each being 
she encountered. Every animal and element, every plague 
and plant, every blade and bug gladly gave their word. Frigg returned to Breidablik, 
and threw a great feast to celebrate. Wine flowed freely, and soon the gods 
took turns testing Baldur’s immunity. Lurking in the corner, 
Loki rolled his eyes. The trickster god had never cared 
for Baldur the Bright, and found his new gift 
profoundly irritating. Surely there was a flaw in Frigg’s plan. Taking the form of an old woman, Loki crept to Frigg’s side 
and feigned confusion. Why were the gods attacking sweet Baldur, 
whom they all loved so dearly? Frigg told her of the oaths, 
but the old woman pressed on. Surely you didn’t receive a vow 
from everything, she asked. Frigg shrugged. The only being she hadn’t visited 
was mistletoe. After all, what god could fear 
a trifling weed? At this, Loki dashed outside 
to find a sprig of mistletoe. When he returned, the festivities 
had grown even rowdier. But not every god was enjoying the party. Baldur’s brother Hodur, who was blind 
and weapon-less, sat dejected. Seeing his opportunity, the trickster slyly offered 
Hodur a chance to participate. Loki armed him with mistletoe, 
guided his aim towards his brother, and told Hodur to hurl with all his might. The mistletoe pierced Baldur’s chest 
with deadly force. The god’s light quickly flickered out, 
and despair swept over the crowd. Within moments, the impact 
of Baldur’s death could be felt across the nine realms. But from the weeping masses, 
Hermod the Brave stepped forward. The warrior god believed that with 
the help of Odin’s mighty steed, there was no plane he could not reach. He would travel to halls of Hel herself, 
and bring Baldur home. The god rode for nine days 
and nine nights, past halls of corpses 
and over paths paved with bone. When he finally reached 
the Queen of the Underworld, Hermod begged her to return 
Baldur to his family. Hel considered taking pity, but she wanted
to know the extent of the gods’ mourning. She agreed to relinquish Baldur’s soul— if Hermod could prove that every 
living thing wept at Baldur’s death. Hermod shot back 
to the land of the living. He met with every creature 
that Frigg visited earlier— all of which cried for Baldur 
and begged for his return. Meanwhile, Loki watched Hermod’s 
mission with disdain. He would not let his work 
be so easily undone, but if he interfered too boldly it might 
reveal his hand in Baldur’s murder. Disguising himself as a ferocious giant, 
he hid himself at Hermod’s final stop. When the warrior came, the howling wind and craggy rocks 
each declared their love for Baldur. But the giant within spewed only contempt 
for the deceased. No matter how much Hermod begged, 
she would not shed a single tear. With his last hope dashed, the god began 
to mourn Baldur a second time. But an echo from the cave 
rang out above his sobs. Loki’s twisted cackle was well-known 
to every Asgardian, and Hermod realized he’d been tricked. As he leapt to accost the trickster, Loki took the form of a salmon 
and wriggled into the waterfall. His escape was guaranteed, 
until Thor arrived at the scene. Dragging Loki back to the cave, the gods 
bound him with a poisonous serpent. Here, Loki would remain chained 
until the end of days— the serpent dripping venom 
on his brow as punishment for dousing Asgard’s brightest light.

**Transcript**:
Baldur— son of All Father Odin 
and Queen Frigg, husband of Nanna the Peaceful, 
and God of truth and light— was the gentlest and most beloved being 
in all of Asgard. In his great hall of Breidablik, Baldur’s soothing presence 
eased his subject’s woes. But lately, he was plagued 
by troubles of his own. Every night, Baldur had gruesome visions 
foretelling his own imminent death. Determined to protect her son 
from these grim prophecies, Queen Frigg travelled 
across the nine realms, begging all living things 
not to harm Baldur. Her grace moved each being 
she encountered. Every animal and element, every plague 
and plant, every blade and bug gladly gave their word. Frigg returned to Breidablik, 
and threw a great feast to celebrate. Wine flowed freely, and soon the gods 
took turns testing Baldur’s immunity. Lurking in the corner, 
Loki rolled his eyes. The trickster god had never cared 
for Baldur the Bright, and found his new gift 
profoundly irritating. Surely there was a flaw in Frigg’s plan. Taking the form of an old woman, Loki crept to Frigg’s side 
and feigned confusion. Why were the gods attacking sweet Baldur, 
whom they all loved so dearly? Frigg told her of the oaths, 
but the old woman pressed on. Surely you didn’t receive a vow 
from everything, she asked. Frigg shrugged. The only being she hadn’t visited 
was mistletoe. After all, what god could fear 
a trifling weed? At this, Loki dashed outside 
to find a sprig of mistletoe. When he returned, the festivities 
had grown even rowdier. But not every god was enjoying the party. Baldur’s brother Hodur, who was blind 
and weapon-less, sat dejected. Seeing his opportunity, the trickster slyly offered 
Hodur a chance to participate. Loki armed him with mistletoe, 
guided his aim towards his brother, and told Hodur to hurl with all his might. The mistletoe pierced Baldur’s chest 
with deadly force. The god’s light quickly flickered out, 
and despair swept over the crowd. Within moments, the impact 
of Baldur’s death could be felt across the nine realms. But from the weeping masses, 
Hermod the Brave stepped forward. The warrior god believed that with 
the help of Odin’s mighty steed, there was no plane he could not reach. He would travel to halls of Hel herself, 
and bring Baldur home. The god rode for nine days 
and nine nights, past halls of corpses 
and over paths paved with bone. When he finally reached 
the Queen of the Underworld, Hermod begged her to return 
Baldur to his family. Hel considered taking pity, but she wanted
to know the extent of the gods’ mourning. She agreed to relinquish Baldur’s soul— if Hermod could prove that every 
living thing wept at Baldur’s death. Hermod shot back 
to the land of the living. He met with every creature 
that Frigg visited earlier— all of which cried for Baldur 
and begged for his return. Meanwhile, Loki watched Hermod’s 
mission with disdain. He would not let his work 
be so easily undone, but if he interfered too boldly it might 
reveal his hand in Baldur’s murder. Disguising himself as a ferocious giant, 
he hid himself at Hermod’s final stop. When the warrior came, the howling wind and craggy rocks 
each declared their love for Baldur. But the giant within spewed only contempt 
for the deceased. No matter how much Hermod begged, 
she would not shed a single tear. With his last hope dashed, the god began 
to mourn Baldur a second time. But an echo from the cave 
rang out above his sobs. Loki’s twisted cackle was well-known 
to every Asgardian, and Hermod realized he’d been tricked. As he leapt to accost the trickster, Loki took the form of a salmon 
and wriggled into the waterfall. His escape was guaranteed, 
until Thor arrived at the scene. Dragging Loki back to the cave, the gods 
bound him with a poisonous serpent. Here, Loki would remain chained 
until the end of days— the serpent dripping venom 
on his brow as punishment for dousing Asgard’s brightest light.

**Transcript**:
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea, through a series of channels
called bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs, adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points between the blood and air 
from the outside world, they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult, but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week, though full recovery may take 
as long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation, or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.

by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult, but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week, though full recovery may take 
as long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation, or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.

**Transcript**:
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea, through a series of channels
called bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs, adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points between the blood and air 
from the outside world, they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Every time you breathe in, 
air travels down the trachea, through a series of channels
called bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters
of air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli
in the lungs, adding up to a surface area 
of roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,
facilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air 
we breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc 
on this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli
that causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds 
of pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones 
are viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body
via droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching 
a contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s
first line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of
mucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward
the mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders 
may get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,
where they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve 
as critical exchange points between the blood and air 
from the outside world, they have their own specialized types
of white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms
by enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,
the macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional
white blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,
they generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product 
of the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside 
the alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide 
in the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try
to clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most
common symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out
of the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia 
can be difficult, but once it is established, 
doctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial
or antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps 
the body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs
fluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out
in about a week, though full recovery may take 
as long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often
manage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia 
can be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,
artificial ventilation, or other supportive measures 
while the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even
the normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume 
associated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible
to pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly 
also have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory
infection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia 
are due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against
the infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways
throughout the body, not just in the lungs. This is actually a protective mechanism, but after too long in this state organs
start shutting down, causing shock and sometimes death. So how can we prevent pneumonia? Eating well and getting enough sleep
and exercise helps your body fight off infections. Vaccines can protect against common 
pneumonia-causing pathogens, while washing your hands regularly helps
prevent the spread of these pathogens— and protect those most vulnerable
to severe pneumonia.

**Transcript**:
After many adventures in Wonderland, Alice has once again found 
herself in the court of the temperamental
Queen of Hearts. She’s about to pass through the garden
undetected, when she overhears the king
and queen arguing. “It’s quite simple,” says the queen.
“64 is the same as 65, and that’s that.” Without thinking, Alice interjects. 
“Nonsense,” she says. “If 64 were the same as 65, 
then it would be 65 and not 64 at all.” “What? How dare you!” the queen huffs. “I’ll prove it right now, 
and then it’s off with your head!” Before she can protest, Alice is dragged toward a field 
with two chessboard patterns— an 8 by 8 square and a 5 by 13 rectangle. As the queen claps her hands, 
four odd-looking soldiers approach and lie down next to each other,
covering the first chessboard. Alice sees that two of them are trapezoids
with non-diagonal sides measuring 5x5x3, while the other two are long triangles
with non-diagonal sides measuring 8x3. “See, this is 64.” The queen claps her hands again. The card soldiers get up, 
rearrange themselves, and lie down atop the second chessboard. “And that is 65." Alice gasps. She’s certain the soldiers
didn’t change size or shape moving from one board to the other. But it’s a mathematical certainty 
that the queen must be cheating somehow. Can Alice wrap her head around what’s
wrong— before she loses it? Pause the video to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Just as things aren’t looking too good 
for Alice, she remembers her geometry, and looks again at the trapezoid 
and triangle soldier lying next to each other. They look like they cover exactly half
of the rectangle, their edges forming one long line 
running from corner to corner. If that’s true, then the slopes 
of their diagonal sides should be the same. But when she calculates these slopes using the tried and true formula
"rise over run," a most curious thing happens. The trapezoid soldier’s diagonal side
goes up 2 and over 5, giving it a slope of two fifths, or 0.4. The triangle soldier’s diagonal, however,
goes up 3 and over 8, making its slope three eights, or 0.375. They’re not the same at all! Before the queen’s guards can stop her, Alice drinks a bit of her shrinking potion
to go in for a closer look. Sure enough, there’s a miniscule gap
between the triangles and trapezoids, forming a parallelogram that stretches
the entire length of the board and accounts for the missing square. There’s something even more curious
about these numbers: they’re all part of the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum 
of the two preceding ones. Fibonacci numbers have two properties
that factor in here: first, squaring a Fibonacci number 
gives you a value that’s one more or one less than the product of the Fibonacci numbers
on either side of it. In other words, 8 squared is one less 
than 5 times 13, while 5 squared is one more 
than 3 times 8. And second, the ratio between successive
Fibonacci numbers is quite similar. So similar, in fact, that it eventually
converges on the golden ratio. That’s what allows devious royals
to construct slopes that look deceptively similar. In fact, the Queen of Hearts could cobble
together an analogous conundrum out of any four consecutive
Fibonacci numbers. The higher they go, the more it seems 
like the impossible is true. But in the words of Lewis Carroll—
author of Alice in Wonderland and an accomplished mathematician
who studied this very puzzle— one can’t believe impossible things.

"rise over run," a most curious thing happens. The trapezoid soldier’s diagonal side
goes up 2 and over 5, giving it a slope of two fifths, or 0.4. The triangle soldier’s diagonal, however,
goes up 3 and over 8, making its slope three eights, or 0.375. They’re not the same at all! Before the queen’s guards can stop her, Alice drinks a bit of her shrinking potion
to go in for a closer look. Sure enough, there’s a miniscule gap
between the triangles and trapezoids, forming a parallelogram that stretches
the entire length of the board and accounts for the missing square. There’s something even more curious
about these numbers: they’re all part of the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum 
of the two preceding ones. Fibonacci numbers have two properties
that factor in here: first, squaring a Fibonacci number 
gives you a value that’s one more or one less than the product of the Fibonacci numbers
on either side of it. In other words, 8 squared is one less 
than 5 times 13, while 5 squared is one more 
than 3 times 8. And second, the ratio between successive
Fibonacci numbers is quite similar. So similar, in fact, that it eventually
converges on the golden ratio. That’s what allows devious royals
to construct slopes that look deceptively similar. In fact, the Queen of Hearts could cobble
together an analogous conundrum out of any four consecutive
Fibonacci numbers. The higher they go, the more it seems 
like the impossible is true. But in the words of Lewis Carroll—
author of Alice in Wonderland and an accomplished mathematician
who studied this very puzzle— one can’t believe impossible things.

**Transcript**:
After many adventures in Wonderland, Alice has once again found 
herself in the court of the temperamental
Queen of Hearts. She’s about to pass through the garden
undetected, when she overhears the king
and queen arguing. “It’s quite simple,” says the queen.
“64 is the same as 65, and that’s that.” Without thinking, Alice interjects. 
“Nonsense,” she says. “If 64 were the same as 65, 
then it would be 65 and not 64 at all.” “What? How dare you!” the queen huffs. “I’ll prove it right now, 
and then it’s off with your head!” Before she can protest, Alice is dragged toward a field 
with two chessboard patterns— an 8 by 8 square and a 5 by 13 rectangle. As the queen claps her hands, 
four odd-looking soldiers approach and lie down next to each other,
covering the first chessboard. Alice sees that two of them are trapezoids
with non-diagonal sides measuring 5x5x3, while the other two are long triangles
with non-diagonal sides measuring 8x3. “See, this is 64.” The queen claps her hands again. The card soldiers get up, 
rearrange themselves, and lie down atop the second chessboard. “And that is 65." Alice gasps. She’s certain the soldiers
didn’t change size or shape moving from one board to the other. But it’s a mathematical certainty 
that the queen must be cheating somehow. Can Alice wrap her head around what’s
wrong— before she loses it? Pause the video to figure it out yourself.
Answer in 3. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Just as things aren’t looking too good 
for Alice, she remembers her geometry, and looks again at the trapezoid 
and triangle soldier lying next to each other. They look like they cover exactly half
of the rectangle, their edges forming one long line 
running from corner to corner. If that’s true, then the slopes 
of their diagonal sides should be the same. But when she calculates these slopes using the tried and true formula
"rise over run," a most curious thing happens. The trapezoid soldier’s diagonal side

**Transcript**:
On a December night in 1910, 
the exiled former leader of Honduras, Manuel Bonilla, boarded 
a borrowed yacht in New Orleans. With a group of heavily armed accomplices, he set sail for Honduras in hopes
of reclaiming power by whatever means necessary. Bonilla had a powerful backer, the future leader 
of a notorious organization known throughout Latin America 
as El Pulpo, or "the Octopus," for its long reach. The infamous El Pulpo 
was a U.S. corporation trafficking in, of all things,
bananas. It was officially known 
as United Fruit Company— or Chiquita Brands International today. First cultivated in Southeast Asia
thousands of years ago, bananas reached the Americas 
in the early 1500s, where enslaved Africans cultivated
them in plots alongside sugar plantations. There were many different bananas, most of which looked nothing like
the bananas in supermarket aisles today. In the 1800s, captains 
from New Orleans and New England ventured to the Caribbean in search 
of coconuts and other goods. They began to experiment with bananas,
purchasing one kind, called Gros Michel, from Afro-Caribbean
farmers in Jamaica, Cuba, and Honduras. Gros Michel bananas produced large bunches
of relatively thick-skinned fruit— ideal for shipping. By the end of the 1800s, 
bananas were a hit in the US. They were affordable, 
available year-round, and endorsed by medical doctors. As bananas became big business, U.S. fruit companies wanted 
to grow their own bananas. In order to secure access to land, banana moguls lobbied and bribed
government officials in Central America, and even funded coups to ensure 
they had allies in power. In Honduras, Manuel Bonilla repaid 
the banana man who had financed his return to power
with land concessions. By the 1930s, one company dominated
the region: United Fruit, who owned over 40% of Guatemala’s 
arable land at one point. They cleared rainforest in Costa Rica,
Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama to build plantations, along with railroads, ports, 
and towns to house workers. Lured by relatively high-paying jobs,
people migrated to banana zones. From Guatemala to Colombia, United Fruit’s plantations grew
exclusively Gros Michel bananas. These densely packed farms 
had little biological diversity, making them ripe for disease epidemics. The infrastructure connecting 
these vulnerable farms could quickly spread disease: pathogens could hitch a ride from one
farm to another on workers’ boots, railroad cars, and steamships. That’s exactly what happened in the 1910s, when a fungus began to level 
Gros Michel banana plantations, first in Panama, and later throughout
Central America, spreading quickly via the same system that
had enabled big profits and cheap bananas. In a race against “Panama Disease,” banana companies abandoned 
infected plantations in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala, leaving thousands of farmers and workers 
jobless. The companies then felled 
extensive tracts of rainforests in order to establish new plantations. After World War II, the dictatorships with which United Fruit
had partnered in Guatemala and Honduras yielded to democratically elected
governments that called for land reform. In Guatemala, President Jacobo Arbenz
tried to buy back land from United Fruit and redistribute it to landless farmers. The Arbenz government offered to pay
a price based on tax records— where United Fruit had underreported
the value of the land. El Pulpo was not happy. The company launched propaganda
campaigns against Arbenz and called on its deep connections 
in the US Government for help. Citing fears of communism,
the CIA orchestrated the overthrow of the democratically elected 
Arbenz in 1954. That same year in Honduras, thousands
of United Fruit workers went on strike until the company agreed to recognize
a new labor union. With the political and economic costs 
of running from Panama Disease escalating, United Fruit finally switched 
from Gros Michel to Panama disease-resistant Cavendish
bananas in the early 1960s. Today, bananas are no longer 
as economically vital in Central America, and United Fruit Company, 
rechristened Chiquita, has lost its stranglehold
on Latin American politics. But the modern banana industry
isn’t without problems. Cavendish bananas require frequent
applications of pesticides that create hazards for farmworkers 
and ecosystems. And though they’re resistant 
to the particular pathogen that affected Gros Michel bananas, Cavendish farms 
also lack biological diversity, leaving the banana trade 
ripe for another pandemic.

**Transcript**:
On a December night in 1910, 
the exiled former leader of Honduras, Manuel Bonilla, boarded 
a borrowed yacht in New Orleans. With a group of heavily armed accomplices, he set sail for Honduras in hopes
of reclaiming power by whatever means necessary. Bonilla had a powerful backer, the future leader 
of a notorious organization known throughout Latin America 
as El Pulpo, or "the Octopus," for its long reach. The infamous El Pulpo 
was a U.S. corporation trafficking in, of all things,
bananas. It was officially known 
as United Fruit Company— or Chiquita Brands International today. First cultivated in Southeast Asia
thousands of years ago, bananas reached the Americas 
in the early 1500s, where enslaved Africans cultivated
them in plots alongside sugar plantations. There were many different bananas, most of which looked nothing like
the bananas in supermarket aisles today. In the 1800s, captains 
from New Orleans and New England ventured to the Caribbean in search 
of coconuts and other goods. They began to experiment with bananas,
purchasing one kind, called Gros Michel, from Afro-Caribbean
farmers in Jamaica, Cuba, and Honduras. Gros Michel bananas produced large bunches
of relatively thick-skinned fruit— ideal for shipping. By the end of the 1800s, 
bananas were a hit in the US. They were affordable, 
available year-round, and endorsed by medical doctors. As bananas became big business, U.S. fruit companies wanted 
to grow their own bananas. In order to secure access to land, banana moguls lobbied and bribed
government officials in Central America, and even funded coups to ensure 
they had allies in power. In Honduras, Manuel Bonilla repaid 
the banana man who had financed his return to power
with land concessions. By the 1930s, one company dominated
the region: United Fruit, who owned over 40% of Guatemala’s 
arable land at one point. They cleared rainforest in Costa Rica,
Colombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama to build plantations, along with railroads, ports, 
and towns to house workers. Lured by relatively high-paying jobs,
people migrated to banana zones. From Guatemala to Colombia, United Fruit’s plantations grew
exclusively Gros Michel bananas. These densely packed farms 
had little biological diversity, making them ripe for disease epidemics. The infrastructure connecting 
these vulnerable farms could quickly spread disease: pathogens could hitch a ride from one
farm to another on workers’ boots, railroad cars, and steamships. That’s exactly what happened in the 1910s, when a fungus began to level 
Gros Michel banana plantations, first in Panama, and later throughout
Central America, spreading quickly via the same system that
had enabled big profits and cheap bananas. In a race against “Panama Disease,” banana companies abandoned 
infected plantations in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala, leaving thousands of farmers and workers 
jobless. The companies then felled 
extensive tracts of rainforests in order to establish new plantations. After World War II, the dictatorships with which United Fruit
had partnered in Guatemala and Honduras yielded to democratically elected
governments that called for land reform. In Guatemala, President Jacobo Arbenz
tried to buy back land from United Fruit and redistribute it to landless farmers. The Arbenz government offered to pay
a price based on tax records— where United Fruit had underreported
the value of the land. El Pulpo was not happy. The company launched propaganda
campaigns against Arbenz and called on its deep connections 
in the US Government for help. Citing fears of communism,
the CIA orchestrated the overthrow of the democratically elected 
Arbenz in 1954. That same year in Honduras, thousands
of United Fruit workers went on strike until the company agreed to recognize
a new labor union. With the political and economic costs 
of running from Panama Disease escalating, United Fruit finally switched 
from Gros Michel to Panama disease-resistant Cavendish
bananas in the early 1960s. Today, bananas are no longer 
as economically vital in Central America, and United Fruit Company, 
rechristened Chiquita, has lost its stranglehold
on Latin American politics. But the modern banana industry
isn’t without problems. Cavendish bananas require frequent
applications of pesticides that create hazards for farmworkers 
and ecosystems. And though they’re resistant 
to the particular pathogen that affected Gros Michel bananas, Cavendish farms 
also lack biological diversity, leaving the banana trade 
ripe for another pandemic.

**Transcript**:
Standing at almost 84 meters tall, this is the largest known living tree
on the planet. Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered
roughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete 
with this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more 
than 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce 
fossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 
to restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help
in this fight? And how do they sequester carbon 
in the first place? Like all plants, trees consume
atmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction 
called photosynthesis. This process uses energy 
from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide 
into oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume 
these carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, 
converting them to energy and releasing carbon 
back into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion
of that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored 
as newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, 
trees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon 
for as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies
and decays, some of its carbon will be released
back into the air. A significant amount of CO2
is stored in the soil, where it can remain 
for thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon
also seeps back into the atmosphere. So if trees are going to help 
fight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester 
their carbon for the longest period possible, 
while also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree 
we could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, 
super sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good 
long-term solution. Forests are complex networks 
of living organisms, and there’s no one species 
that can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant 
are always native ones; species that already play a role 
in their local environment. Preliminary research shows 
that ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity
of trees have less competition for resources and better resist
climate change. This means we can’t just plant trees 
to draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. There are numerous regions
that have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led 
by Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery 
of the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary
for human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares 
of additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised
the scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative 
but still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,
these restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200
billion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth
of humanity’s carbon emissions. More than half of the potential
forest canopy for new restoration efforts 
can be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight
into existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares
of forest by 2030. But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best 
restored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing 
to do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers
worry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended 
consequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually 
accelerate climate change. And even if we succeed 
in restoring these areas, future generations would need
to protect them from the natural and economic forces
that previously depleted them. Taken together, these challenges
have damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity 
of rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important 
it is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring 
some of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction 
necessary to combat climate change on a larger scale. If we get it right, maybe these modern
trees will have time to grow into carbon carrying titans.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Standing at almost 84 meters tall, this is the largest known living tree
on the planet. Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered
roughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete 
with this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more 
than 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce 
fossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 
to restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help
in this fight? And how do they sequester carbon 
in the first place? Like all plants, trees consume
atmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction 
called photosynthesis. This process uses energy 
from sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide 
into oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume 
these carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, 
converting them to energy and releasing carbon 
back into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion
of that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored 
as newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, 
trees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon 
for as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies
and decays, some of its carbon will be released
back into the air. A significant amount of CO2
is stored in the soil, where it can remain 
for thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon
also seeps back into the atmosphere. So if trees are going to help 
fight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester 
their carbon for the longest period possible, 
while also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree 
we could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, 
super sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good 
long-term solution. Forests are complex networks 
of living organisms, and there’s no one species 
that can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant 
are always native ones; species that already play a role 
in their local environment. Preliminary research shows 
that ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity
of trees have less competition for resources and better resist
climate change. This means we can’t just plant trees 
to draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. There are numerous regions
that have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led 
by Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery 
of the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary
for human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares 
of additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised
the scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative 
but still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,
these restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200
billion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth
of humanity’s carbon emissions. More than half of the potential
forest canopy for new restoration efforts 
can be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight
into existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares
of forest by 2030. But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best 
restored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing 
to do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers
worry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended 
consequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually 
accelerate climate change. And even if we succeed 
in restoring these areas, future generations would need
to protect them from the natural and economic forces
that previously depleted them. Taken together, these challenges
have damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity 
of rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important 
it is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring 
some of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction 
necessary to combat climate change on a larger scale. If we get it right, maybe these modern
trees will have time to grow into carbon carrying titans.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Ah, a witch hunt. Humans are tireless
in their pursuit of reason. "It’s 1950. Following threats from the communist 
governments of the Soviet Union and China, anti-communist sentiment in 
the United States is at an all-time high. Senator Joseph McCarthy claims 
he has a list of 205 communists in the US who are influencing government policy." Didn’t I just change the channel? Ah, I see. It’s a different witch hunt. "The senate forms a committee 
to investigate McCarthy’s claims. McCarthy names his first case: against prominent lawyer, judge,
and activist Dorothy Kenyon. He accuses her of membership to 28 
organizations that are communist fronts. Newspapers around the country 
rush to her defense, pointing out her vocally 
anti-communist record. The senate committee schedules 
a hearing anyway, and she has just five days to prepare." This is too much. If the government won’t be 
a voice of reason, I’ll have to. That’s better. I’m surprised you good legislators
have agreed to move this hearing forward. You’re falling prey to a type 
of argument from ignorance: assuming that a claim is true 
because it hasn’t been proven false. The claim being Senator McCarthy’s 
accusations against Judge Kenyon, for which he provided 
no legitimate evidence. Is that right? I thought so. Some of the so-called communist 
organizations he accused her of joining don’t even exist. To assume a claim is true 
because it hasn’t been proven false ignores many other possibilities: that it hasn’t been proven false yet, 
that it can’t be proven true or false, or that it isn’t completely true 
or completely false, to name a few. This leads to a handy rule of thumb: the burden of proof lies with the person
making the claim. In other words, you make the claim,
you supply the proof. If someone told you aliens exist, would you head off to find proof
that they don’t exist? Of course not. You’d tell that person 
to show you the UFO. The same applies when someone 
makes a claim that contradicts an established consensus. So when all the available evidence 
suggests that humans are causing an increase 
in global temperatures, the burden of proof has been fulfilled— if you disagree, it becomes 
your responsibility to prove otherwise. Right? Ah, I’ve gotten ahead of myself. You’ll see what I mean soon enough. Anyway, your legal system 
supposedly recognizes this rule— so what are you all doing here? "It’s July 17th, 1950, and the senate subcommittee has officially
dismissed all charges against Kenyon." As they should! "It’s 1954, and the senate 
has formally disciplined McCarthy." Took them long enough! "He will serve out the rest of his term, but will never again be elected 
to a public office. Because of his widespread 
anti-communist influence, hundreds of people have been incarcerated,
and thousands have lost their jobs." Ah! Look what the communists did!

**Transcript**:
On the edge of the vast Sahara desert, citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu and took to the wilderness. They buried chests in the desert sand,
hid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure 
more valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Founded around 1100 CE 
in what is now Mali, the city of Timbuktu started 
out as an unremarkable trading post. But its unique location 
soon changed that. Timbuktu marked the intersection
of two essential trade routes, where caravans bringing 
salt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold
from the African interior. By the late 1300s, these trade routes 
made Timbuktu rich, and the city’s rulers, 
the kings of the Mali Empire, built monuments and academies
that drew scholars from Egypt, Spain, and Morocco. The city’s prime location also made
it a target for warlords and conquerors. As the Mali Empire declined, 
one of its domains, Songhai, began to gain power. In 1468, the Songhai king 
conquered Timbuktu, burning buildings and murdering scholars. But in time, intellectual life 
in the city flourished again. The reign of the second king 
of the Songhai Empire, Askia Mohammed Toure, marked the beginning of a golden age 
in Timbuktu. He reversed his predecessor’s
regressive policies and encouraged learning. The Songhai rulers and most of Timbuktu’s 
population were Muslim, and the scholars of Timbuktu 
studied Islam alongside secular topics 
like mathematics and philosophy. In the libraries of Timbuktu, tracts of Greek philosophy stood
alongside the writings of local historians, scientists,
and poets. The city’s most prominent scholar,
Ahmed Baba, challenged prevailing opinions
on subjects ranging from smoking to slavery. Gold and salt trade had funded
the city’s transformation into a center of learning. Now, the products 
of that intellectual culture became the most sought-after 
commodity. With paper from faraway Venice and vibrant ink from local plants
and minerals, the scribes of Timbuktu produced 
texts in both Arabic and local languages. Written in calligraphy and decorated
with intricate geometric designs, the books of Timbuktu were in demand
among the wealthiest members of society. In 1591, the golden age 
came to an abrupt end when the Moroccan king 
captured Timbuktu. Moroccan forces imprisoned 
Ahmed Baba and other prominent scholars and confiscated their libraries. In the centuries that followed, the city 
weathered a succession of conquests. In the mid-1800s, 
Sufi Jihadists occupied Timbuktu and destroyed many non-religious
manuscripts. 1894, French colonial forces seized
control of the city, stealing even more manuscripts
and sending them to Europe. French became the official language
taught in schools, and new generations in Timbuktu couldn’t read the Arabic manuscripts 
that remained. Through it all, the literary tradition
of Timbuktu didn’t die— it went underground. Some families built secret libraries
in their homes, or buried the books in their gardens. Others stashed them in abandoned caves 
or holes in the desert. The priceless manuscripts of Timbuktu dispersed to villages 
throughout the surrounding area, where regular citizens guarded 
them for hundreds of years. As desertification and war 
impoverished the region, families held on to the ancient books even as they faced desperate poverty
and near-starvation. Even today, the struggle to protect
the books continues. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, Timbuktu scholar Abdel Kader Haidara
painstakingly retrieved hidden manuscripts from all over northern Mali 
and brought them back to Timbuktu. But in 2012, civil war in Mali 
once again threatened the manuscripts, most of which were evacuated
to nearby Bamako. Their future remains uncertain, as they face both human 
and environmental threats. These books represent our best—
and often only— sources on the pre-colonial history
of the region. Many of them have never been 
read by modern scholars, and still more remain lost 
or hidden in the desert. At stake in the efforts to protect
them is the history they contain— and the efforts of countless generations
to protect that history from being lost.

**Transcript**:
On the edge of the vast Sahara desert, citizens snuck out of the city of Timbuktu and took to the wilderness. They buried chests in the desert sand,
hid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure 
more valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Founded around 1100 CE 
in what is now Mali, the city of Timbuktu started 
out as an unremarkable trading post. But its unique location 
soon changed that. Timbuktu marked the intersection
of two essential trade routes, where caravans bringing 
salt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold
from the African interior. By the late 1300s, these trade routes 
made Timbuktu rich, and the city’s rulers, 
the kings of the Mali Empire, built monuments and academies
that drew scholars from Egypt, Spain, and Morocco. The city’s prime location also made
it a target for warlords and conquerors. As the Mali Empire declined, 
one of its domains, Songhai, began to gain power. In 1468, the Songhai king 
conquered Timbuktu, burning buildings and murdering scholars. But in time, intellectual life 
in the city flourished again. The reign of the second king 
of the Songhai Empire, Askia Mohammed Toure, marked the beginning of a golden age 
in Timbuktu. He reversed his predecessor’s
regressive policies and encouraged learning. The Songhai rulers and most of Timbuktu’s 
population were Muslim, and the scholars of Timbuktu 
studied Islam alongside secular topics 
like mathematics and philosophy. In the libraries of Timbuktu, tracts of Greek philosophy stood
alongside the writings of local historians, scientists,
and poets. The city’s most prominent scholar,
Ahmed Baba, challenged prevailing opinions
on subjects ranging from smoking to slavery. Gold and salt trade had funded
the city’s transformation into a center of learning. Now, the products 
of that intellectual culture became the most sought-after 
commodity. With paper from faraway Venice and vibrant ink from local plants
and minerals, the scribes of Timbuktu produced 
texts in both Arabic and local languages. Written in calligraphy and decorated
with intricate geometric designs, the books of Timbuktu were in demand
among the wealthiest members of society. In 1591, the golden age 
came to an abrupt end when the Moroccan king 
captured Timbuktu. Moroccan forces imprisoned 
Ahmed Baba and other prominent scholars and confiscated their libraries. In the centuries that followed, the city 
weathered a succession of conquests. In the mid-1800s, 
Sufi Jihadists occupied Timbuktu and destroyed many non-religious
manuscripts. 1894, French colonial forces seized
control of the city, stealing even more manuscripts
and sending them to Europe. French became the official language
taught in schools, and new generations in Timbuktu couldn’t read the Arabic manuscripts 
that remained. Through it all, the literary tradition
of Timbuktu didn’t die— it went underground. Some families built secret libraries
in their homes, or buried the books in their gardens. Others stashed them in abandoned caves 
or holes in the desert. The priceless manuscripts of Timbuktu dispersed to villages 
throughout the surrounding area, where regular citizens guarded 
them for hundreds of years. As desertification and war 
impoverished the region, families held on to the ancient books even as they faced desperate poverty
and near-starvation. Even today, the struggle to protect
the books continues. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, Timbuktu scholar Abdel Kader Haidara
painstakingly retrieved hidden manuscripts from all over northern Mali 
and brought them back to Timbuktu. But in 2012, civil war in Mali 
once again threatened the manuscripts, most of which were evacuated
to nearby Bamako. Their future remains uncertain, as they face both human 
and environmental threats. These books represent our best—
and often only— sources on the pre-colonial history
of the region. Many of them have never been 
read by modern scholars, and still more remain lost 
or hidden in the desert. At stake in the efforts to protect
them is the history they contain— and the efforts of countless generations
to protect that history from being lost.

**Transcript**:
If you go to the store in search of milk, there are a dizzying number 
of products to choose from. There’s dairy milk, 
but also plant-based products. To turn a plant into something
resembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained,
rinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried, and milled into flour. The plant paste or flour is then 
fortified with vitamins and minerals, flavoured, and diluted with water. The result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities
of animal milk. So which milk is actually best for you? Let’s dive into some of the most 
popular milks: dairy, almond, soy, or oat? A 250 ml glass of cow’s milk contains
8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, 
and 2 to 8 grams of fat depending on if it’s skim, 
reduced fat, or whole. That’s approximately 15% 
the daily protein an average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates
and 2 to 15% the fat. Most plant-based milks have 
less carbohydrates than dairy milk. They also have less fat, but more
of what’s often called “good fats.” Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients
vitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don’t occur naturally 
in most plant-based milks. Looking more closely 
at our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low 
in protein compared to dairy. But while almond milk has the least
nutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, 
a healthy type of fibre. It also has a lot of carbohydrates
compared to other plant milks— sometimes as much as dairy milk. Soy milk, meanwhile, 
has as much protein as cow’s milk and is also a great source
of potassium. Soybeans contain isoflavone, which people used to think 
might trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen. But ultimately, soy milk contains
very small amounts of isoflavones, which have a much weaker effect
on our bodies than estrogen. Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be
the clear winner: if you’re lactose intolerant, 
then the plant-based milks pull ahead, while if you’re allergic to nuts,
almond milk is out. For people who don’t have access 
to a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient
way to get these nutrients. But all else being equal, 
any one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part 
of a balanced diet. That’s why for many people, 
the milk that’s best for you is actually the milk 
that’s best for the planet. So which uses the fewest resources
and produces the least pollution? It takes almost 4 square kilometers
to produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation
and habitat destruction. Most of that is land the cows live on,
and some is used to grow their feed. Many cows eat soy beans and oats. It takes much less land to grow 
the oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow— only about a quarter square kilometer
per glass. Almond milk has similar land use. But where that land is also matters— soybean farms are a major driver
of deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren’t. Making milk uses water 
every step of the way, but it’s the farming stage 
where big differences emerge. Dairy milk uses the most water—
about 120 liters per glass, mostly to water cows 
and grow their food. Almonds take second place, at more
than 70 liters of water per glass. Most of that water is used to grow
almond trees, which take years of watering before
they start producing almonds. The trees must be watered consistently,
or they die, while many other crops can be
left fallow and still produce later. All told, soy and oats require less 
water to grow: only about 5 to 10 liters 
per glass of milk. Milk production generates some
greenhouse gas emissions— about 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms per glass 
for the plant-based milks. But for dairy milk, the cows themselves 
also produce emissions by burping and farting out large
quantities of the gas methane. Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram 
of greenhouse gas emissions. So while depending on your dietary
needs, any one of these milks may be a good
fit, in terms of the health of our planet there’s a strong case for choosing 
plant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk.

of animal milk. So which milk is actually best for you? Let’s dive into some of the most 
popular milks: dairy, almond, soy, or oat? A 250 ml glass of cow’s milk contains
8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, 
and 2 to 8 grams of fat depending on if it’s skim, 
reduced fat, or whole. That’s approximately 15% 
the daily protein an average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates
and 2 to 15% the fat. Most plant-based milks have 
less carbohydrates than dairy milk. They also have less fat, but more
of what’s often called “good fats.” Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients
vitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don’t occur naturally 
in most plant-based milks. Looking more closely 
at our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low 
in protein compared to dairy. But while almond milk has the least
nutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, 
a healthy type of fibre. It also has a lot of carbohydrates
compared to other plant milks— sometimes as much as dairy milk. Soy milk, meanwhile, 
has as much protein as cow’s milk and is also a great source
of potassium. Soybeans contain isoflavone, which people used to think 
might trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen. But ultimately, soy milk contains
very small amounts of isoflavones, which have a much weaker effect
on our bodies than estrogen. Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be
the clear winner: if you’re lactose intolerant, 
then the plant-based milks pull ahead, while if you’re allergic to nuts,
almond milk is out. For people who don’t have access 
to a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient
way to get these nutrients. But all else being equal, 
any one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part 
of a balanced diet. That’s why for many people, 
the milk that’s best for you is actually the milk 
that’s best for the planet. So which uses the fewest resources
and produces the least pollution? It takes almost 4 square kilometers
to produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation
and habitat destruction. Most of that is land the cows live on,
and some is used to grow their feed. Many cows eat soy beans and oats. It takes much less land to grow 
the oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow— only about a quarter square kilometer
per glass. Almond milk has similar land use. But where that land is also matters— soybean farms are a major driver
of deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren’t. Making milk uses water 
every step of the way, but it’s the farming stage 
where big differences emerge. Dairy milk uses the most water—
about 120 liters per glass, mostly to water cows 
and grow their food. Almonds take second place, at more
than 70 liters of water per glass. Most of that water is used to grow
almond trees, which take years of watering before
they start producing almonds. The trees must be watered consistently,
or they die, while many other crops can be
left fallow and still produce later. All told, soy and oats require less 
water to grow: only about 5 to 10 liters 
per glass of milk. Milk production generates some
greenhouse gas emissions— about 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms per glass 
for the plant-based milks. But for dairy milk, the cows themselves 
also produce emissions by burping and farting out large
quantities of the gas methane. Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram 
of greenhouse gas emissions. So while depending on your dietary
needs, any one of these milks may be a good
fit, in terms of the health of our planet there’s a strong case for choosing 
plant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk.

**Transcript**:
History’s first empire rose 
out of a hot, dry landscape, without rainfall to nourish crops, 
without trees or stones for building. In spite of all this, its inhabitants
built the world’s first cities, with monumental architecture 
and large populations— and they built them 
entirely out of mud. Sumer occupied the southern part 
of modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia means “between two rivers”— the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used
irrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm 
large areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this 
were slowly springing up around the world. But Sumerians were the first
to take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied
homes and temples. They invented the wheel— a potter’s wheel, for turning mud 
into household goods and tools. Those clay bricks gave rise 
to the world’s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE. At the top of the city’s social ladder
were priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople,
farmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire 
consisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations. They were loosely linked 
by language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control. The earliest cities were Uruk, 
Ur, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role 
somewhere between a priest and a ruler. Sometimes they fought against 
each other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,
considered the city’s founder. The largest and most important building 
in the city was this patron god’s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed
as a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began 
to expand their reach. The potter’s wheel found a new home 
on chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds 
and date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried 
them vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, 
they built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, 
Anatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, 
lapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention 
of the world’s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting
for Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, 
the early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first
written laws and created the first school system, 
designed to teach the craft of writing— and pioneered some less exciting
innovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying 
from dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,
and copied works of literature— hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, 
magic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told 
the story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was
also the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer
was no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured
into the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,
adopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script 
to express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon
conquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians
existed side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused 
only on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed
off the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared 
back into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered
until the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived 
on for thousands of years— first through the Akkadians,
then the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian 
inventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures. Some persist today.

each other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,
considered the city’s founder. The largest and most important building 
in the city was this patron god’s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed
as a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began 
to expand their reach. The potter’s wheel found a new home 
on chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds 
and date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried 
them vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, 
they built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, 
Anatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, 
lapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention 
of the world’s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting
for Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, 
the early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first
written laws and created the first school system, 
designed to teach the craft of writing— and pioneered some less exciting
innovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying 
from dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,
and copied works of literature— hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, 
magic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told 
the story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was
also the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer
was no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured
into the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,
adopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script 
to express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon
conquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians
existed side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused 
only on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed
off the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared 
back into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered
until the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived 
on for thousands of years— first through the Akkadians,
then the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian 
inventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures. Some persist today.

**Transcript**:
This is a kindergarten
we designed in 2007. We made this kindergarten 
to be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation
on top of the roof. If you are a parent, you know that kids love
to keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this? The principal of this kindergarten said, "No, I don't want a handrail." I said, "It's impossible." But he insisted: "How about having a net
sticking out from the edge of the roof? So that it can catch
the children falling off?" (Laughter) I said, "It's impossible." And of course,
the government official said, "Of course you have to have a handrail." But we could keep 
that idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call 
this rope as a handrail. But of course, rope has nothing
to do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more, and more, more. (Laughter) Sometimes 40 children 
are around a tree. The boy on the branch, he loves the tree
so he is eating the tree. (Laughter) And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. (Laughter) Feeding time. (Laughter) 
(Applause) And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see
children on top of the roof, not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high,
you see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place --
there are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water
to your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's putting water into his boots. (Laughter) This kindergarten is completely
open, most of the year. And there is no boundary
between inside and outside. So it means basically
this architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary
between classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner
doesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. He will come back eventually,
because it's a circle, it comes back. (Laughter) But the point is,
in that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. But here, just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly, we consider
noise very important. You know that children
sleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten, these children show
amazing concentration in class. And you know, our kind grew up
in the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know, you can talk
to your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know, these days we are trying to make
everything under control. You know, it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is 50 degrees. And also, you should know
that you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So, children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. (Laughter) I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always 
some trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish
another monkey from above. (Laughter) Monkeys. (Laughter) And each classroom has
at least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus
comes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building, right next to that
oval-shaped kindergarten. The building is only
five meters tall with seven floors. And of course,
the ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So, we put our children,
a daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. (Laughter) And he is trying to see
if it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful
in Tokyo, as you know. (Laughter) The driver in front,
she needs to learn how to drive. Now these days, kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of
opportunity we are losing these days. Now, this drawing is showing
the movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. And the circumference
of this building is 183 meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did 6,000 meters
in the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten
do 4,000 meters on average. And these children have
the highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says, "I don't train them.
We leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep." (Laughter) They keep running. (Laughter) My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable
of changing this world, and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts
to change the lives of children. Thank you very much. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
Deep in the Amazon rainforest 
in the river Nea’ocoyá, lived,
according to Siekopai legend, a school
of particularly big and tasty fish. When the rains came and the water rose, 
the fish appeared, swimming away as the waters fell again. The villagers along the river reveled
in this occasional bounty— and wanted more. They followed them upriver deep 
into the jungle to a lagoon that thundered 
with the sound of flapping fish. The whole village set up camp 
by the lagoon, bringing barbasco, a poison they would put
in the water to stun the fish. Meanwhile, their young shaman took a walk. He sensed he might not be 
completely alone. Then, he came to a monse tree
humming so loudly he could hear it even above the thunder
of the fish. With that, he was sure:
spirits lived here. Back at camp, he warned his people 
these fish had an owner. He would find the owner. Until he returned, no one should fish. He went to the humming tree. Inside was a hollow as big as a house,
full of busy weavers. Their chief invited him in, explaining that the juicy 
little siripia fruits were ripening, and they were weaving
baskets to collect them. Though they looked and acted like people, the shaman knew they were juri,
or air goblins, who could fly and control the winds. They taught him how to weave. Before the shaman left, the goblin chief whispered 
some cryptic instructions in his ear. Finally, he told him to tie 
a pineapple shoot outside a hollow log and sleep inside that night. Back at camp, the villagers were fishing
with barbasco poison, cooking, and eating. Only the shaman’s little sister refrained. Then, everyone else fell
into a deep sleep. The shaman and his sister 
yelled and shook them, but they wouldn’t wake. It was getting dark, 
so the shaman and his sister tied the pineapple sprout outside 
the hollow log and crawled inside. A strong wind rose—
the mark of the air goblins. It broke branches 
and brought down trees. Caymans, boas and jaguars roared. The water began to rise. The fish flopped off the drying racks 
and swam away. The pineapple sprout turned into a dog. All night it barked, keeping the jungle
creatures away from the fallen tree. When dawn broke, the flood receded. The fish were gone, 
and most of the people were, too: the jungle animals had devoured them. Only the shaman’s relatives survived. When his family turned toward him, the shaman realized what the goblins meant
when they said the fruits were ripening: they weren’t really collecting 
siripia fruits at all, but human eyes. The shaman’s older sister called him over, trying to touch his face 
with her long, sharp nails. He backed away and, remembering 
the goblin chief’s instructions, threw palm seeds at her face. The seeds became eyes. But then she transformed 
into a white-lipped peccary and ran away— still alive, but no longer human. The shaman and his little sister’s 
whole community was gone. They went to live with another village, where he taught everyone to weave baskets,
as the air goblins had taught him. But he couldn’t forget the last 
of the goblin chief’s words, which told him how to get revenge. He returned to the air goblins’ home
carrying chili peppers wrapped in leaves. As the goblins watched 
through their peepholes, the shaman made a fire 
and put the chili peppers on it. The fire began to smoke the tree out. The goblins who had eaten 
people’s eyes died. Those who hadn’t 
were light enough to fly away. So the goblins, like the humans, 
paid a steep price. But they also lived to tell the tale,
like the shaman. In Siekopai legend, where the spirit 
and human worlds meet, there are no clear victors, and even death
is an opportunity for renewal.

with her long, sharp nails. He backed away and, remembering 
the goblin chief’s instructions, threw palm seeds at her face. The seeds became eyes. But then she transformed 
into a white-lipped peccary and ran away— still alive, but no longer human. The shaman and his little sister’s 
whole community was gone. They went to live with another village, where he taught everyone to weave baskets,
as the air goblins had taught him. But he couldn’t forget the last 
of the goblin chief’s words, which told him how to get revenge. He returned to the air goblins’ home
carrying chili peppers wrapped in leaves. As the goblins watched 
through their peepholes, the shaman made a fire 
and put the chili peppers on it. The fire began to smoke the tree out. The goblins who had eaten 
people’s eyes died. Those who hadn’t 
were light enough to fly away. So the goblins, like the humans, 
paid a steep price. But they also lived to tell the tale,
like the shaman. In Siekopai legend, where the spirit 
and human worlds meet, there are no clear victors, and even death
is an opportunity for renewal.

**Transcript**:
Deep in the Amazon rainforest 
in the river Nea’ocoyá, lived,
according to Siekopai legend, a school
of particularly big and tasty fish. When the rains came and the water rose, 
the fish appeared, swimming away as the waters fell again. The villagers along the river reveled
in this occasional bounty— and wanted more. They followed them upriver deep 
into the jungle to a lagoon that thundered 
with the sound of flapping fish. The whole village set up camp 
by the lagoon, bringing barbasco, a poison they would put
in the water to stun the fish. Meanwhile, their young shaman took a walk. He sensed he might not be 
completely alone. Then, he came to a monse tree
humming so loudly he could hear it even above the thunder
of the fish. With that, he was sure:
spirits lived here. Back at camp, he warned his people 
these fish had an owner. He would find the owner. Until he returned, no one should fish. He went to the humming tree. Inside was a hollow as big as a house,
full of busy weavers. Their chief invited him in, explaining that the juicy 
little siripia fruits were ripening, and they were weaving
baskets to collect them. Though they looked and acted like people, the shaman knew they were juri,
or air goblins, who could fly and control the winds. They taught him how to weave. Before the shaman left, the goblin chief whispered 
some cryptic instructions in his ear. Finally, he told him to tie 
a pineapple shoot outside a hollow log and sleep inside that night. Back at camp, the villagers were fishing
with barbasco poison, cooking, and eating. Only the shaman’s little sister refrained. Then, everyone else fell
into a deep sleep. The shaman and his sister 
yelled and shook them, but they wouldn’t wake. It was getting dark, 
so the shaman and his sister tied the pineapple sprout outside 
the hollow log and crawled inside. A strong wind rose—
the mark of the air goblins. It broke branches 
and brought down trees. Caymans, boas and jaguars roared. The water began to rise. The fish flopped off the drying racks 
and swam away. The pineapple sprout turned into a dog. All night it barked, keeping the jungle
creatures away from the fallen tree. When dawn broke, the flood receded. The fish were gone, 
and most of the people were, too: the jungle animals had devoured them. Only the shaman’s relatives survived. When his family turned toward him, the shaman realized what the goblins meant
when they said the fruits were ripening: they weren’t really collecting 
siripia fruits at all, but human eyes. The shaman’s older sister called him over, trying to touch his face 
with her long, sharp nails. He backed away and, remembering

**Transcript**:
In a study in the 1990s, participants recalled getting lost 
in a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories
in vivid detail— one even remembered that the old man
who rescued him was wearing a flannel shirt. But none of these people 
had actually gotten lost in a mall. They produced these false memories when the psychologists conducting 
the study told them they’d gotten lost, and although they might not remember
the incident, their parents had confirmed it. And it wasn’t just one or two people 
who thought they remembered getting lost— a quarter of the participants did. These findings may sound unbelievable, but they actually reflect 
a very common experience. Our memories are sometimes unreliable. And though we still don’t know precisely
what causes this fallibility on a neurological level, research has highlighted some 
of the most common ways our memories diverge from what actually happened. The mall study highlights how we can
incorporate information from outside sources, like other people or the news, into our personal recollections
without realizing it. This kind of suggestibility is just 
one influence on our memories. Take another study, in which researchers briefly showed 
a random collection of photographs to a group of participants, including images of a university campus
none of them had ever visited. When shown the images three weeks later, a majority of participants said 
that they had probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. The participants misattributed information
from one context— an image they’d seen— onto another— a memory of something
they believed they actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown
an image of a magnifying glass, and then told to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw 
the magnifying glass and the lollipop. They struggled to link the objects 
to the correct context— whether they actually saw them,
or simply imagined them. Another study, where a psychologist 
questioned over 2,000 people on their views about the legalization 
of marijuana, highlights yet another kind 
of influence on memory. Participants answered questions 
in 1973 and 1982. Those who said they had supported
marijuana legalization in 1973, but reported they were against it in 1982, were more likely to recall that they were 
actually against legalization in 1973— bringing their old views in line 
with their current ones. Our current opinions,
feelings, and experiences can bias our memories 
of how we felt in the past. In another study, researchers gave two groups
of participants background information on a historical war and asked them to rate
the likelihood that each side would win. They gave each group the same information, except that they only told one group
who had actually won the war— the other group didn’t know 
the real world outcome. In theory, both groups’ answers 
should be similar, because the likelihood
of each side winning isn’t effected by who actually won— if there’s a 20% chance of thunderstorms,
and a thunderstorm happens, the chance of thunderstorms
doesn’t retroactively go up to 100%. Still, the group that knew 
how the war ended rated the winning side as more likely 
to win than the group who did not. All of these fallibilities of memory 
can have real-world impacts. If police interrogations use leading
questions with eye witnesses or suspects, suggestibility could result in incorrect 
identifications or unreliable confessions. Even in the absence of leading questions, misattribution can lead to inaccurate 
eyewitness testimony. In a courtroom, if a judge rules a piece of evidence 
inadmissible and tells jurors to disregard it,
they may not be able to do so. In a medical setting, if a patient 
seeks a second opinion and the second physician is aware 
of the first one’s diagnosis, that knowledge may bias their conclusion. Our memories are not ironclad 
representations of reality, but subjective perceptions. And there’s not necessarily
anything wrong with that— the problems arise when we treat
memory as fact, rather than accepting
this fundamental truth about the nature of our recollections.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
In a study in the 1990s, participants recalled getting lost 
in a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories
in vivid detail— one even remembered that the old man
who rescued him was wearing a flannel shirt. But none of these people 
had actually gotten lost in a mall. They produced these false memories when the psychologists conducting 
the study told them they’d gotten lost, and although they might not remember
the incident, their parents had confirmed it. And it wasn’t just one or two people 
who thought they remembered getting lost— a quarter of the participants did. These findings may sound unbelievable, but they actually reflect 
a very common experience. Our memories are sometimes unreliable. And though we still don’t know precisely
what causes this fallibility on a neurological level, research has highlighted some 
of the most common ways our memories diverge from what actually happened. The mall study highlights how we can
incorporate information from outside sources, like other people or the news, into our personal recollections
without realizing it. This kind of suggestibility is just 
one influence on our memories. Take another study, in which researchers briefly showed 
a random collection of photographs to a group of participants, including images of a university campus
none of them had ever visited. When shown the images three weeks later, a majority of participants said 
that they had probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. The participants misattributed information
from one context— an image they’d seen— onto another— a memory of something
they believed they actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown
an image of a magnifying glass, and then told to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw 
the magnifying glass and the lollipop. They struggled to link the objects 
to the correct context— whether they actually saw them,
or simply imagined them. Another study, where a psychologist 
questioned over 2,000 people on their views about the legalization 
of marijuana, highlights yet another kind 
of influence on memory. Participants answered questions 
in 1973 and 1982. Those who said they had supported
marijuana legalization in 1973, but reported they were against it in 1982, were more likely to recall that they were 
actually against legalization in 1973— bringing their old views in line 
with their current ones. Our current opinions,
feelings, and experiences can bias our memories 
of how we felt in the past. In another study, researchers gave two groups
of participants background information on a historical war and asked them to rate
the likelihood that each side would win. They gave each group the same information, except that they only told one group
who had actually won the war— the other group didn’t know 
the real world outcome. In theory, both groups’ answers 
should be similar, because the likelihood
of each side winning isn’t effected by who actually won— if there’s a 20% chance of thunderstorms,
and a thunderstorm happens, the chance of thunderstorms
doesn’t retroactively go up to 100%. Still, the group that knew 
how the war ended rated the winning side as more likely 
to win than the group who did not. All of these fallibilities of memory 
can have real-world impacts. If police interrogations use leading
questions with eye witnesses or suspects, suggestibility could result in incorrect 
identifications or unreliable confessions. Even in the absence of leading questions, misattribution can lead to inaccurate 
eyewitness testimony. In a courtroom, if a judge rules a piece of evidence 
inadmissible and tells jurors to disregard it,
they may not be able to do so. In a medical setting, if a patient 
seeks a second opinion and the second physician is aware 
of the first one’s diagnosis, that knowledge may bias their conclusion. Our memories are not ironclad 
representations of reality, but subjective perceptions. And there’s not necessarily
anything wrong with that— the problems arise when we treat
memory as fact, rather than accepting
this fundamental truth about the nature of our recollections.

**Transcript**:
In 1901, David Hänig published a paper that forever changed 
our understanding of taste. His research led to what we know 
today as the taste map: an illustration that divides the tongue 
into four separate areas. According to this map, receptors at the tip of our tongues
capture sweetness, bitterness 
is detected at the tongue’s base, and along the sides, receptors capture 
salty and sour sensations. Since its invention, the taste map 
has been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, 
is that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even 
an accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed 
but largely incorrect. So where do misconceptions 
like this come from, and what makes a fake fact 
so easy to believe? It’s true that the tongue map’s 
journey begins with David Hänig. As part of his dissertation 
at Leipzig University, Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across 
the tongue for the four basic flavors. Using sucrose for sweet, 
quinine sulfate for bitter, hydrochloric acid for sour, 
and salt for salty, Hänig applied these stimuli to compare 
differences in taste thresholds across a subject’s tongue. He hoped to better understand 
the physiological mechanisms that affected these four flavors, and his data suggested that sensitivity 
for each taste did in fact vary across the tongue. The maximum sensation for sweet 
was located at the tongue’s tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back;
salt was strongest in this area, and sour at the middle 
of the tongue’s sides. But Hänig was careful 
to note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue, and that the areas he identified offered 
very small variations in intensity. Like so many misconceptions, the tongue map represents a distortion 
of its original source, however the nature of that distortion 
can vary. Some misconceptions 
are comprised of disinformation— false information intentionally designed 
to mislead people. But many misconceptions, 
including the tongue map, center on misinformation—
false or misleading information that results from unintentional 
inaccuracy. Misinformation is most often shaped 
by mistakes and human error, but the specific mistakes 
that lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied. In the case of the tongue map, Hänig’s dissertation was written 
in German, meaning the paper could only be 
understood by readers fluent in German and well versed in Hanig’s 
small corner of academia. This kicked off a game of telephone 
that re-shaped Häing’s research every time it was shared 
with outside parties. Less than a decade after his dissertation, newspapers were falsely insisting 
that experiments could prove sweetness was imperceptible 
on the back of the tongue. The second culprit 
behind the tongue map’s spread were the images 
that Hänig’s work inspired. In 1912, a rough version of the map 
appeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described 
some of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. Featuring clear labels across the tongue,
the article’s illustration simplified Hänig’s more-complicated 
original diagrams. Variations of this approachable image 
became repeatedly cited, often without credit or nuanced 
consideration for Hänig’s work. Eventually this image spread 
to textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth 
of how we experience taste. But perhaps the factor that most 
contributed to this misconception was its narrative simplicity. In many ways, the map complements our desire for clear 
stories about the world around us— a quality not always present 
in the sometimes-messy fields of science. For example, even the number of tastes we have is more 
complicated than Hänig’s work suggests. Umami— also known as savory— 
is now considered the fifth basic taste, and many still debate 
the existence of tastes like fatty, alkaline, metallic, 
and water-like. Once we hear a good story, it can be difficult to change 
how we see that information, even in the face of new evidence. So, next time you see a convenient chart 
or read a surprising anecdote, try to maintain a healthy skepticism— because misconceptions 
can leave a bitter taste on every part of your tongue.

has been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, 
is that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even 
an accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed 
but largely incorrect. So where do misconceptions 
like this come from, and what makes a fake fact 
so easy to believe? It’s true that the tongue map’s 
journey begins with David Hänig. As part of his dissertation 
at Leipzig University, Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across 
the tongue for the four basic flavors. Using sucrose for sweet, 
quinine sulfate for bitter, hydrochloric acid for sour, 
and salt for salty, Hänig applied these stimuli to compare 
differences in taste thresholds across a subject’s tongue. He hoped to better understand 
the physiological mechanisms that affected these four flavors, and his data suggested that sensitivity 
for each taste did in fact vary across the tongue. The maximum sensation for sweet 
was located at the tongue’s tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back;
salt was strongest in this area, and sour at the middle 
of the tongue’s sides. But Hänig was careful 
to note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue, and that the areas he identified offered 
very small variations in intensity. Like so many misconceptions, the tongue map represents a distortion 
of its original source, however the nature of that distortion 
can vary. Some misconceptions 
are comprised of disinformation— false information intentionally designed 
to mislead people. But many misconceptions, 
including the tongue map, center on misinformation—
false or misleading information that results from unintentional 
inaccuracy. Misinformation is most often shaped 
by mistakes and human error, but the specific mistakes 
that lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied. In the case of the tongue map, Hänig’s dissertation was written 
in German, meaning the paper could only be 
understood by readers fluent in German and well versed in Hanig’s 
small corner of academia. This kicked off a game of telephone 
that re-shaped Häing’s research every time it was shared 
with outside parties. Less than a decade after his dissertation, newspapers were falsely insisting 
that experiments could prove sweetness was imperceptible 
on the back of the tongue. The second culprit 
behind the tongue map’s spread were the images 
that Hänig’s work inspired. In 1912, a rough version of the map 
appeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described 
some of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. Featuring clear labels across the tongue,
the article’s illustration simplified Hänig’s more-complicated 
original diagrams. Variations of this approachable image 
became repeatedly cited, often without credit or nuanced 
consideration for Hänig’s work. Eventually this image spread 
to textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth 
of how we experience taste. But perhaps the factor that most 
contributed to this misconception was its narrative simplicity. In many ways, the map complements our desire for clear 
stories about the world around us— a quality not always present 
in the sometimes-messy fields of science. For example, even the number of tastes we have is more 
complicated than Hänig’s work suggests. Umami— also known as savory— 
is now considered the fifth basic taste, and many still debate 
the existence of tastes like fatty, alkaline, metallic, 
and water-like. Once we hear a good story, it can be difficult to change 
how we see that information, even in the face of new evidence. So, next time you see a convenient chart 
or read a surprising anecdote, try to maintain a healthy skepticism— because misconceptions 
can leave a bitter taste on every part of your tongue.

**Transcript**:
In 1901, David Hänig published a paper that forever changed 
our understanding of taste. His research led to what we know 
today as the taste map: an illustration that divides the tongue 
into four separate areas. According to this map, receptors at the tip of our tongues
capture sweetness, bitterness 
is detected at the tongue’s base, and along the sides, receptors capture 
salty and sour sensations. Since its invention, the taste map 
has been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, 
is that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even 
an accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed
