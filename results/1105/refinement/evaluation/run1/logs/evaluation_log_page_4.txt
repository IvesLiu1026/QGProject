**Transcript**:
Winter is coming - and we've all been told to put on a jacket outside, or you'll catch a cold! Of course, the common response of today has become 'Don't be silly, being cold can't give you a cold'. Or can it? Who wins in this battle of the beliefs? The correlation between cold weather and sickness does stand out. Between 5-20% of Americans catch a cold or flu every year around late fall and winter. Not to mention, it's called a cold. But there are some important things to consider. First and foremost: colds and the flu are caused by viruses. if there aren't any around, you won't catch a cold - no matter how cold you get. It's as simple as that. So why the correlation with decreasing temperatures? Well for one, people tend to stay indoors much more often during the winter, which in turn, puts them in contact with more people. More people, means more exposure opportunities for the pathogens to spread. On top of this, humidity plays a role in the spread of some viruses. As the humidity decreases in the winter, not only does the virus spread more readily, but the mucus in your nose dries out. Mucus would otherwise act as a protective barrier to pathogens. Finnaly, the lack of Vitamin D which we get from the sun, can affect  our immune system adversely. Both being inside more often, and the fact that winter has shorter days makes this a big factor for your health. So you've proven your parents wrong... right? Not so fast! While some past studies have shown no correlation to temperature, recent evidence suggest otherwise. One study which put test subjects feet into ice water found that they were, indeed, more likely to develop common cold symptoms in the following days, than those who didn't. The developing hypothesis behind these results is that the cold temperatures cause blood vessel constriction, which slows the white blood cells from reaching the virus, ultimately inhibiting the immune response. Cortisol levels, which pressures the immune system, are also increased with temperature induced stress. Furthermore, studies on both mice and human airway cells found that immune reaction to the common cold virus, in fact, temperature dependent. Warm infected cells are more likely to undergo programmed cell death, to limit the spread of infection. Finally, studies of the virus itself have revealed a secret weapon of sorts. In winter temperature, the virus's outer layer or envelope becomes much harder and acts like a shield. This allows it to spread from person to person much more easily. But at warm temperatures, this layer is more of a gel, which is not quite tough enough to protect the virus against the elements. As a result, its spreading ability is compromised. So, maybe your parents weren't so wrong after all. A happy compromise of going outside more often, bundled up, is likely to get you through the winter unscathed. New to AsapSCIENCE?

**Transcript**:
Winter is coming - and we've all been told to put on a jacket outside, or you'll catch a cold! Of course, the common response of today has become 'Don't be silly, being cold can't give you a cold'. Or can it? Who wins in this battle of the beliefs? The correlation between cold weather and sickness does stand out. Between 5-20% of Americans catch a cold or flu every year around late fall and winter. Not to mention, it's called a cold. But there are some important things to consider. First and foremost: colds and the flu are caused by viruses. if there aren't any around, you won't catch a cold - no matter how cold you get. It's as simple as that. So why the correlation with decreasing temperatures? Well for one, people tend to stay indoors much more often during the winter, which in turn, puts them in contact with more people. More people, means more exposure opportunities for the pathogens to spread. On top of this, humidity plays a role in the spread of some viruses. As the humidity decreases in the winter, not only does the virus spread more readily, but the mucus in your nose dries out. Mucus would otherwise act as a protective barrier to pathogens. Finnaly, the lack of Vitamin D which we get from the sun, can affect  our immune system adversely. Both being inside more often, and the fact that winter has shorter days makes this a big factor for your health. So you've proven your parents wrong... right? Not so fast! While some past studies have shown no correlation to temperature, recent evidence suggest otherwise. One study which put test subjects feet into ice water found that they were, indeed, more likely to develop common cold symptoms in the following days, than those who didn't. The developing hypothesis behind these results is that the cold temperatures cause blood vessel constriction, which slows the white blood cells from reaching the virus, ultimately inhibiting the immune response. Cortisol levels, which pressures the immune system, are also increased with temperature induced stress. Furthermore, studies on both mice and human airway cells found that immune reaction to the common cold virus, in fact, temperature dependent. Warm infected cells are more likely to undergo programmed cell death, to limit the spread of infection. Finally, studies of the virus itself have revealed a secret weapon of sorts. In winter temperature, the virus's outer layer or envelope becomes much harder and acts like a shield. This allows it to spread from person to person much more easily. But at warm temperatures, this layer is more of a gel, which is not quite tough enough to protect the virus against the elements. As a result, its spreading ability is compromised. So, maybe your parents weren't so wrong after all. A happy compromise of going outside more often, bundled up, is likely to get you through the winter unscathed. New to AsapSCIENCE?

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What is the main reason why the correlation between cold weather and sickness stands out?**
Options: A. Because cold temperatures cause blood vessel constriction, B. Because cold temperatures increase cortisol levels, C. Because people tend to stay indoors more often during the winter, D. Because the virus's outer layer becomes harder in winter temperatures
Correct Option: C

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it only addresses one aspect of the question (people staying indoors more often). A more comprehensive match would be:

**Question 3: Why do people tend to stay indoors more often during the winter?** is not a perfect match, as it only addresses one aspect of the question (people staying indoors more often).

A more comprehensive match would be a question that addresses all aspects of the ground truth MCQ (people staying indoors more often, mucus drying out, and lack of Vitamin D). Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose **Question 9**, as it at least addresses one aspect of the question (people staying indoors more often).

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **9**

Please note that this is not a perfect match, and a more comprehensive question that addresses all aspects of the ground truth MCQ would be a better match.

7 a.m kirill petrov the man of the house the 
first thing that he does every morning is to   heat the house with a wood burning stove to keep 
his family warm on the ice cold morning in yakutia because of the severe climate 
he really needs a lot of wood   to hit the house for nine months non-stop just like a dessert drinking water in yakut 
village is precious there are no water treatment   facilities because the pipes freeze during the 
long winter so ice is the main source of water   kirill and the villagers harvested the ice 
from the river in the middle of november   when the temperature was favorable to harvest eyes meanwhile kirill's wife liubov is making delicious 
untraditional breakfast kercheh whipped cream with   a strawberry germ which was harvested during the 
summer in yakutia during the harsh climate it's   almost impossible to grow fruits and vegetables so 
most of the yogurt desserts consist of dairy food it's 7 40 am and it's time for 
arian the youngest son to wake up arian is nine years old and 
attends the local primary school   the children in yakutia will go to school 
when it's warmer than minus 54 degrees   but when the temperature drops below minus 
55 degrees it's too dangerous to go to school   today is relatively warm in yakutia only minus 
40 degrees which means aryan must go to school like most people around the world he wash his face   and brush his teeth arian uses the ice 
cold water that his dad prepared earlier breakfast fatty pancakes and whipped cream are 
high energy food that warms you up during cold   winters aryan's older sisters are living and 
studying in university far away from the village   his parents wish for him to study well 
so he can live his life as he wants um locals understand the importance 
of learning the right clothing   to survive in such extreme winters it's an 
absolute must to wear several layers of clothing   and wear insulated pumps because the 
knees are particularly prone to freezing aryan's mom always makes sure that everyone 
wears enough clothes because without proper   dressing the cold will reach deep inside 
your bones threatening your life she also   makes sure that his face is fully covered 
otherwise the exposed part can get frostbite the temperature outside is so cold so the moisture 
immediately forms little icicles on his eyelashes   10 minutes in the fresh air can be enough 
to cause fatigue stinging pain in the face   and long-lasting eggs in the fingers and toes but 
little harder yogurts knows how to find the cold but after a few minutes the icy weather 
begins to assert itself forcefully   aryan has been on his way for 10 minutes already 
and now the nine years old aryan is freezing luckily the last few meters are 
left and arian is finally at school aryan arrives in time and there are already 
many children who have also arrived by food   arian is studying in the third grade 
of primary school the primary school   last four years and in yakuza education 
last 11 years before going to university there are about eight students in the class 
today and five hours of daily studying begins today they have math literature 
art geography history and languages   yakut people study three languages at school 
russian english and sakha sakha is the mother   tongue which belonged to the turkey group and 
is totally different from the russian language   for daily life studying and working 
knowing the russian language is essentially after the first two lessons it's time for 
a second breakfast today menu is apple and   x eating regularly is essential to increase 
energy in the cold winters for little yakuts after breakfast the play indoors the 
temperature is too cold to play outside   and after all it takes too long to dress up again usually the classes end at 2 pm but today arian 
finished a little earlier now he's on his way   back home with his friend and like kids all around 
the world they can't ignore the local snack shop   everyone likes ice cream and aryan 
and his friends are no exception   they love sweet and creamy frozen 
ice cream despite the extreme cold aryan and his friends on their way home 
are playing little games and having fun   parents are not worried about their 
children it's a close-knit community   all the locals know each other and there 
are about 800 people in the whole village almost all the houses are made 
of wood each resident burns   more than 60 cubic meters on average every winter   for the house to keep warm and to protect 
the house from the freezing air they make   sure to fill every gap with oakum or snow but 
still the cold finds a way to come through wild yogurt and horses are also neighbors 
in this icy land they have thick skin and   heavy hair coat and are able to effectively 
forage in the snow for vegetation to eat   the yakutian horses can cope with 
temperatures down to minus 70 degrees thank you aryan is back home and ready to help 
his father most men in the village are   engaged in the cattle breeding hunting 
or crafts same as aryan's father i mean is well known craftsman in yakutia 
kirill makes traditional yakut knives   for many centuries knives have played an important 
role in the lives and the culture of yakut people   yakut knives are well known around the 
world for their strengths and beauty aryan's father is teaching him these traditional 
crafts that has been passed through the   generations the plate is traditionally 
forged from the locally sourced iron ore   the knife handle is made from birch 
wood which is extremely strong my another of aryan's daily 
duties is to chop the firewood   aryan knows from early age that daily work 
is necessary to survive in such extreme cold so now it's time for lunch and arian 
is always here to help his mom   they are preparing a christian carp 
fish which his stats caught in the river   people love eating fish and meat 
in a frozen boiled or fried state after the work is done aryan 
rushes to the toilets outside   in yakutia there are no indoors toilets because 
the pipes freeze easily everything happens   outside the stand very efficiently and no one 
spends more time than necessary out in the cold this fish is aryan's favorite it's 
so tasty and the most delicious   fat and nutritious part is the fish real eggs uh hmm foreign fishing and hunting are important sources of 
food in yakutia from early spring until the   autumn cold the yakuts are eating fish aryan loves 
fishing with his father at the beginning of march   it's the perfect time for kuiuur 
which is traditional ice fishing using their rods and nuts they start fishing arian loves spending time with his 
father in nature they are fishing   hunting and working hard to survive in this 
extremely cold but beautiful land yakuta after a few hours finally 
aryan has caught the fish you don't need to worry about bonking the fish 
because in just a few seconds it's shock frozen life in yakutia can be difficult unpleasant 
and dangerous but we have learned how to live   in harmony is mother nature and we appreciate 
the nature treasures and gifts that surround   us we can always find a beauty even in this 
extremely cold climate after all there is   no such thing as the bad weather there is 
just weather and your attitude towards it

7 a.m kirill petrov the man of the house the 
first thing that he does every morning is to   heat the house with a wood burning stove to keep 
his family warm on the ice cold morning in yakutia because of the severe climate 
he really needs a lot of wood   to hit the house for nine months non-stop just like a dessert drinking water in yakut 
village is precious there are no water treatment   facilities because the pipes freeze during the 
long winter so ice is the main source of water   kirill and the villagers harvested the ice 
from the river in the middle of november   when the temperature was favorable to harvest eyes meanwhile kirill's wife liubov is making delicious 
untraditional breakfast kercheh whipped cream with   a strawberry germ which was harvested during the 
summer in yakutia during the harsh climate it's   almost impossible to grow fruits and vegetables so 
most of the yogurt desserts consist of dairy food it's 7 40 am and it's time for 
arian the youngest son to wake up arian is nine years old and 
attends the local primary school   the children in yakutia will go to school 
when it's warmer than minus 54 degrees   but when the temperature drops below minus 
55 degrees it's too dangerous to go to school   today is relatively warm in yakutia only minus 
40 degrees which means aryan must go to school like most people around the world he wash his face   and brush his teeth arian uses the ice 
cold water that his dad prepared earlier breakfast fatty pancakes and whipped cream are 
high energy food that warms you up during cold   winters aryan's older sisters are living and 
studying in university far away from the village   his parents wish for him to study well 
so he can live his life as he wants um locals understand the importance 
of learning the right clothing   to survive in such extreme winters it's an 
absolute must to wear several layers of clothing   and wear insulated pumps because the 
knees are particularly prone to freezing aryan's mom always makes sure that everyone 
wears enough clothes because without proper   dressing the cold will reach deep inside 
your bones threatening your life she also   makes sure that his face is fully covered 
otherwise the exposed part can get frostbite the temperature outside is so cold so the moisture 
immediately forms little icicles on his eyelashes   10 minutes in the fresh air can be enough 
to cause fatigue stinging pain in the face   and long-lasting eggs in the fingers and toes but 
little harder yogurts knows how to find the cold but after a few minutes the icy weather 
begins to assert itself forcefully   aryan has been on his way for 10 minutes already 
and now the nine years old aryan is freezing luckily the last few meters are 
left and arian is finally at school aryan arrives in time and there are already 
many children who have also arrived by food   arian is studying in the third grade 
of primary school the primary school   last four years and in yakuza education 
last 11 years before going to university there are about eight students in the class 
today and five hours of daily studying begins today they have math literature 
art geography history and languages   yakut people study three languages at school 
russian english and sakha sakha is the mother   tongue which belonged to the turkey group and 
is totally different from the russian language   for daily life studying and working

**Transcript**:
FLORA LICHTMAN: When
astronauts go up in space, they're allowed to bring
some special items. DON PETTIT: Some astronauts
fly M&M's, some people fly beef jerky. FLORA LICHTMAN: Don Pettit,
this guy, chose candy corn. He's a NASA astronaut
who spent nearly half a year floating around the
International Space Station. And while he was up in space-- DON PETTIT: I elected to
spend my off-duty time doing science of my own design. FLORA LICHTMAN: Like this
zero-gravity candy corn demonstration. DON PETTIT: It's a
macroscopic analogy to how a surfactant molecule works. FLORA LICHTMAN: And a
surfactant molecule just means-- DON PETTIT: Soap. FLORA LICHTMAN: So in
this demo, a candy corn is equivalent to
a soap molecule. And this water blob
represents grease or oil. And basically the demo shows
how soap cleans grease. Soap molecules have
a water loving end-- DON PETTIT: So they
call that hydrophilic. FLORA LICHTMAN: And
a water heating end-- DON PETTIT: Hydrophobic. FLORA LICHTMAN: And
that's important. DON PETTIT: Say you
have a blob of oil, and you throw it in
a washing machine, the hydrophobic
part of the molecule sticks into the
grease and the oil and the hydrophilic part
pokes up into the water. FLORA LICHTMAN: In candy corn,
the hydrophobic/hydrophilic sides are reversed-- this part is water
loving and Pettit coated this side with oil
to make it water hating. But the principle is the same. The molecules, or
the candy corn, arrange themselves around
the glob, based on attraction or repulsion to water. DON PETTIT: Of course, that's
how your clothes get clean. You cover them with these
hydrophilic/hydrophobic molecules, called soap. FLORA LICHTMAN: And once
the soap molecules fully cover the grease blob,
it becomes water-soluble. DON PETTIT: It's called the
critical micelle concentration. FLORA LICHTMAN:
Or in candy corn-- DON PETTIT: The critical
candy corn concentration. FLORA LICHTMAN: Once it
hits this concentration-- DON PETTIT: All the dirt
in the oil and the grease floats off of your fabric
and it mixes with the water and then you pour the
water off and you're left with clean clothes. FLORA LICHTMAN:
Now in candy corn there's a bonus science
lesson, after you reach the critical candy
corn concentration-- DON PETTIT: And a most
amazing thing happens. FLORA LICHTMAN: The blob
goes from smushy to rigid. You can think of it like-- DON PETTIT: Of putting the
keystone in a Roman arch. Where now, all of
a sudden, gravity locks all the stones together
and you have this rigid arch that you could
drive traffic across. FLORA LICHTMAN:
But we're in space. So it's not gravity at
work, it's surface tension holding the ball together. This was one of many
experiments Pettit did in space but it's the only one
that used candy corn. DON PETTIT: And I used our whole
crew's supply of candy corn for this one demonstration,
which I profusely apologized to the
rest of the crew because they didn't get eat any. For Science Friday,
I'm Flora Lichtman. [MUSIC PLAYING]

skills in the new year, SciShow viewers get up to 65% off when you

from them, we can all agree that bees are beneficial
little critters. Various species make it possible for us to
have blueberries, and almonds, and, of course, honey. They pollinate flowers, they do that charming
little waggle dance, and they help corpses decompose. Yeah, I said corpses. Now, this isn’t something that all bees
do, so no need to look sideways at the jar of
honey on your kitchen counter. This is mainly a vulture bee thing. Vulture bees make up three species of bees
in the genus Trigona, and live in the rainforests of South and Central
America. Like honeybees, vulture bees are social hive-dwellers. They are also obligate necrophages, which
means they eat mostly carrion. or dead things. This is not the sort of cuisine that most
bees tend to be into. Though it’s worth mentioning that some bees
forage for both pollen and carrion. And vulture bees are not strictly carnivorous,
either. They do also get carbohydrates from plant
sources like fruit. And they hunt wasp larvae, because they weren’t
hardcore enough already I guess. But one thing they will never do is visit
a flower. They prefer a nice steak. The bees find a corpse, strip it, and bring
the meat back to the hive. After that, it’s not really clear what happens,
but it’s probably not a barbecue. Instead, the bees store the carrion away…
to do something. The bees might use the meat to produce hypopharyngeal
gland secretions, which is what honeybees use to make the royal
jelly that feeds the queen and her young. They might also use it to make corpse honey. Which I’ve heard is just great on a sourdough
toast. Vulture bees evolved fairly recently from
pollen-eating ancestors. It’s definitely possible for an animal to
make this kind of dietary 180, but in order for it to work, something unusual has to happen in the gut
microbiome, the community of microbes that lives in the
animal’s gut. It is believed that all bees are descended
from a common ancestor that had five major types of microbe in its gut. And most bees still have all five. These microbes serve distinct jobs, like helping
break down toxic sugars that can sometimes be found in pollen. The authors of a 2021 study wanted to find
out how the microbiome of pollen-eating bees compared to the microbiome of vulture bees. They found that vulture bees still have some
of those same microbes. But not all of them. And they have new ones, too. Unsurprisingly, they have microbes that are
strictly for meat eating. But not as many as researchers expected them
to have. They also have some of the same microbes pollen-eating
bees have. Now, this might mean that the microbes adapted
to the carrion diet as the bees did. But, it might also mean that those microbes
were doing something unrelated to diet in the first place. For example, certain microbes in the microbiomes
of other insects may help protect their host from disease by preventing the overgrowth
of pathogenic bacteria. It's not really clear, though, how the change
in microbiome happened. It's kind of a chicken and egg thing. Like, whether the bacteria changed first,
and that made the change in diet possible. Or whether the microbiome changed because
the bees’ diet changed. And vulture bees, like all bees, are descended
from meat-eating wasps, so in the end these bees are kind of just
getting back to their roots. And the about face in their gut microbes can
tell us a lot about how the microbiome adapts to changes in diet. Not bad for the makers of corpse honey. We cannot teach you the language of bee dances, but you can learn human languages with today’s

**Transcript**:
Some people are so full of life and and energy, but for some reason even when you seem to get more than enough sleep, you're still fighting off yawns and fatigue through the day. So, why are you always tired? If you the number of the hours of sleep isn't the problem, the second most common cause of fatigue comes from lack of physical activity and a poor diet. Study after study finds that adults who began light exercise a few times a week reported more energy after six weeks. People who exercise more regularly also report sleeping better. Even though studies show that they aren't sleeping any longer. But if that doesn't help, don't go straight to your cup of joe. While many studies show that coffee is good for your health research show that your reliance on it can make you more sleepy. Caffeine blocks adenosine in your brain which normally accumulates through the day and makes you sleepy at night. But consuming coffee or energy drinks less that 6 hours before bed can ultimately affect your sleep quality. As a result people who don't use caffeine often report feeling less tired in the morning. You might consider making sure you're fully hydrated with some water first too. One study found that a drop of 1.5% in our bodies normal water levels can cause difficulty concentrating. Your blood thickens which slows down nutrients and oxygen getting to your muscles and organs. However a 2% drop is enough to make you feel thirsty so while there's no need to gulping down gallons of water. Staying hydrated throughout the day will certainly help. Urine should be pale yellow. Any darker and it's time for some water. Those glasses of wine or beers before bed may also be affecting your day. Studies have found that after becoming intoxicated while test subjects would fall asleep faster their quality of sleep was actually much lower, particularly during the second half of their night sleep. Ultimately alcohol reduces the amount of REM sleep you get. And, if you're binge drinking and sleeping in on the weekends be aware that a consistent sleep schedule is key. Try waking up close to your normal time on weekends and having short 20 minutes naps in the day. These will still recharge your body without going into deep sleep and making you more tired. You're also more likely to fall asleep at a correct time on Sunday evening making Moday morning easier. Of course your mental well-being plays a role too. Anxiety is a big one. Worrying what people think, always feeling tense about work or being overly concerned about every decision can be physically exhausting. And fatigue is one of the main symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Not only that, but anxiety may be affecting your sleep quality. On another serious end, depression can cause physical, and emotinal fatigue which more sleep won't necessarily relieve. For some it causes insomnia or inability to fall asleep in the first place. Unfortunately there's no quick fix for the 10% of Americans who do suffer from depression. So if you think you may be depressed see your physician or psychologist. Finally, you might also simply be a night owl. Around 20% of population have genetics making them predisposed to staying up late. But living in our nine-to-five world may make it difficult for you to get the proper amont of sleep. In fact, scientists call this phenomenon social jet lag. Well night owls feel like they're living in the wrong time zone every day. If nothing seems to help, there may be an underlying medical condition causing your fatigue which should be talked about with your physician. Got a burning question you want answered?

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as igloos, snow, and insulation, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of fatigue and exercise.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 2 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of fatigue and exercise, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

In this case, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are relevant to the topic, rather than trying to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the existing generated MCQs.

If you would like, I can try to generate some new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of fatigue and exercise, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
For thousands of years, humans, and plants
and animals long before that, have been using frozen “sky water” to keep warm. Which sort of doesn’t make sense. Because snow is cool. You might even say it’s… ice cold. YEEAAHHHHH! No one knows for sure who built the first
igloo, but with the right fit and the right physics, snow can actually warm you better
than the inside of a tauntaun. "You'll be ok, Luke!" So, how can something cold keep you cozy? [MUSIC] The vast, frozen Arctic is one of the most
forbidding environments on our planet, yet, the Inuit have managed to live there for about
5,000 years. Out on the pack ice, winter temperatures reach
50 degrees below zero , and when it’s that cold, surviving means finding shelter. It’s not an area known for its forests,
so nomadic hunters learned to build with the only thing available: snow. Eskimo languages really do have dozens and
dozens of different words for snow, because there are a lot of different types, and the
type of snow you choose can dictate whether your igloo keeps you warm, or turns you into
a Homo sapiensicle. To understand this, we need to know a little
something about being cold. When your body temperature starts to plummet
– you’re feeling heat leave you. Cold can’t move into your body – in fact,
there is no such thing as cold. Where have I heard that before? Oh, right! Think of heat as an actual quantity of stuff:. The more you give away, the colder you feel. This trading of heat can happen three different
ways: by convection, conduction, and radiation. All three are at play in an igloo. A person inside will radiate body heat, which
moves around the igloo by convection, and is lost through the walls by conduction. This is exactly what happens in your house. Living insulation does the same thing. Fatty tissues like blubber help stop heat
transfer in whales and seals, but for animals who don’t have as much junk in the trunk,
they cover themselves in air. Sea otter fur, for example, is about a thousand
times denser than human hair. It’s snuggly stuff
"This is the softest thing I've ever felt in my life. You are adorable!"
…but the secret to its insulation power is in its texture. Otter fur is spiky, so it traps insulating
air molecules. And that is exactly what snowflakes do. Powdery, fresh snow can be up to 95% trapped
air. This makes it an excellent insulator, but
the same way you have to pack it in your hands to make a snowball, it isn’t dense enough
to build with. Solid ice, on the other hand, makes a good
windbreaker, but it’s too heavy to lift. Inuit hunters took the Goldilocks approach:
the secret to good igloo snow is somewhere in the middle. Traditional igloo blocks aren’t molded,
they’re cut out of the ground. That tightly-packed ground snow is dense enough
to hold up, but because it still has far more air pockets than a block of ice, it’s light,
and still a pretty good insulator. As usual, animals figured this one out long
before humans. Polar bears, groundhogs, even birds like grouse
all make snow burrows to stay warm. And even before that, plants were tucking
into snow to avoid death by freezing. During the warm months, heat energy from the
sun builds up in soil, and just like the the roof above your head, a deep covering of snow
prevents that heat from escaping onward and upward. This snowy blanket above stops ice crystals

**Transcript**:
For thousands of years, humans, and plants
and animals long before that, have been using frozen “sky water” to keep warm. Which sort of doesn’t make sense. Because snow is cool. You might even say it’s… ice cold. YEEAAHHHHH! No one knows for sure who built the first
igloo, but with the right fit and the right physics, snow can actually warm you better
than the inside of a tauntaun. "You'll be ok, Luke!" So, how can something cold keep you cozy? [MUSIC] The vast, frozen Arctic is one of the most
forbidding environments on our planet, yet, the Inuit have managed to live there for about
5,000 years. Out on the pack ice, winter temperatures reach
50 degrees below zero , and when it’s that cold, surviving means finding shelter. It’s not an area known for its forests,
so nomadic hunters learned to build with the only thing available: snow. Eskimo languages really do have dozens and
dozens of different words for snow, because there are a lot of different types, and the
type of snow you choose can dictate whether your igloo keeps you warm, or turns you into
a Homo sapiensicle. To understand this, we need to know a little
something about being cold. When your body temperature starts to plummet
– you’re feeling heat leave you. Cold can’t move into your body – in fact,
there is no such thing as cold. Where have I heard that before? Oh, right! Think of heat as an actual quantity of stuff:. The more you give away, the colder you feel. This trading of heat can happen three different
ways: by convection, conduction, and radiation. All three are at play in an igloo. A person inside will radiate body heat, which
moves around the igloo by convection, and is lost through the walls by conduction. This is exactly what happens in your house. Living insulation does the same thing. Fatty tissues like blubber help stop heat
transfer in whales and seals, but for animals who don’t have as much junk in the trunk,
they cover themselves in air. Sea otter fur, for example, is about a thousand
times denser than human hair. It’s snuggly stuff
"This is the softest thing I've ever felt in my life. You are adorable!"
…but the secret to its insulation power is in its texture. Otter fur is spiky, so it traps insulating
air molecules. And that is exactly what snowflakes do. Powdery, fresh snow can be up to 95% trapped
air. This makes it an excellent insulator, but
the same way you have to pack it in your hands to make a snowball, it isn’t dense enough
to build with. Solid ice, on the other hand, makes a good
windbreaker, but it’s too heavy to lift. Inuit hunters took the Goldilocks approach:
the secret to good igloo snow is somewhere in the middle. Traditional igloo blocks aren’t molded,
they’re cut out of the ground. That tightly-packed ground snow is dense enough
to hold up, but because it still has far more air pockets than a block of ice, it’s light,
and still a pretty good insulator. As usual, animals figured this one out long
before humans. Polar bears, groundhogs, even birds like grouse
all make snow burrows to stay warm. And even before that, plants were tucking
into snow to avoid death by freezing. During the warm months, heat energy from the
sun builds up in soil, and just like the the roof above your head, a deep covering of snow
prevents that heat from escaping onward and upward. This snowy blanket above stops ice crystals
from forming inside plant roots, and shoots, and seeds. Not freezing to death is a pretty good motivator
for any animal to get crafty, but our big primate brains took it one step further with
igloos. Their engineering maximizes warmth and stability. Cartoon igloos look like flat-bottomed half-spheres,
but in reality, they’re neither of those things! If you were to slice a real igloo in half,
you’d see a shape called a catenary. This gradually sloping shape is the same one
that would form if you held a chain from both ends and let it droop. A catenary arch distributes weight more evenly
than a half circle, without bulging or buckling. In fact it’s one of the most stable arches
in nature, so sound that we still use it today. Inside, snow houses are carved in different
levels. The hot air rises, and the cold air sinks
down into the lower part, and away from where you would eat, sleep, and chill. To boot, body heat melts the innermost layer
of the walls, strengthening the barrier between you, your airy snow-block insulation, and
the frigid great beyond. When you live in an igloo, you act as a living
furnace. Over time, the temperature in your icy abode
can hover some 40-60 degrees above the surrounding air, but bring a friend to your igloo party,
and you’ll get warmer, faster. Stay cozy, and stay curious! "Hey, you remember that thing I said about

now take a look at these two brains they look identical right they're the same size have roughly the same number of brain cells and the same number of connections between regions but one is smarter than the other so why well the answer might be in those connections so we used to think that bigger brains were better or that each part of the brain just had one job but now we're learning that almost everything the brain does it relies on a pattern of communication and this new way of thinking about your brain has some weird similarities with the game twister so I took my stocking feet game in search for an expert in this new way of thinking about thinking this big-picture perspective of how your brain works is called the networked neuroscience researchers use images of your brain like from a brain scanner to make a map of the major connections among your brain regions those regions become nodes in the network with connections or edges between them like stations in a network of train tracks this wiring of your brain network has different patterns that shift all the time when you learn or when you multitask and a new theory suggests that how this wiring ships in response to intellectual tasks is the best predictor of intelligence I am Danielle Bassets I am an associate professor of bioengineering care at the University of Pennsylvania and I'm a MacArthur Fellow so to detangle this network approach I came to UPenn to meet Danielle she analyzes how these brain networks respond to you doing certain activities like learning something new somebody learns by changing the pattern of connections and the brain and those pattern of connections tells you which parts of the brain are communicating with one another so what's happening now is we're learning is that different parts of the brain are communicating in ways that they didn't before and this is what twister comes in right foot on yellow oh the structure of the game is a simplified way to think of these networks in your brain it's like a network in your brain because different parts of your brain are like us so I'm a part of the brain you are a part of the brain you're making three connections to two blue areas and one yellow area and I'm making two connections to two red areas as we play a game we're going to change the connections and as a person learns these connections between brain regions can change they can connect and put apart and connect again so this pattern may be illustrative of the connectivity at one particular point in time but then it would reconfigure to form new connections would reconfigure it would reconfigure it would reconfigure it would reconfigure over time as people are learning and a measure of this reconfiguring is called cognitive flexibility it's a capacity to change from one task to another task it can indicate how smart you are the quicker your brain configures an reconfigures its connectivity in response to the changing needs of a task the better it works the better you are at learning new things multitasking or switching between tasks and possibly higher intelligence recent research suggests that general intelligence depends on this dynamic reconfiguration of your main networks but like most research about intelligence it raises even more questions I think there's a lot of components to intelligence and that cognitive flexibility is certainly one that associate with intelligence but I wouldn't I wouldn't say that it necessarily constitutes you know it certainly doesn't explain 100 percent of what intelligence actually is but what we can say is that cognitive flexibility is amazing so is there a way to make my brain more flexible so I can be a super fast learner or a super multitasker a super Tasker how can I reconfigure my brain to be the best level so what we know so far is that people who are very good learners have very changeable networks so their patterns of connectivity change very quickly that change ability of the network is related to how positive somebody feels on a particular day or so even a positive mood and the degree to which they have slept well the night before and had breakfast and I feel that if I sleep well yes if I you will have a more changeable brain network pattern of connections and all the researchers suggest that exercise can boost our cognitive flexibility too they seem like pretty simple takeaways but remember that they've come from analyzing a huge and super complicated map of the human brain so I think what we're doing in neuroscience is trying to say it's not just about single brain regions it's not just about single connections is about it's about the whole pattern which is admitting a high level of complexity but from that we can gain very simple intuitions about what makes a brain network healthy and then what makes it altered in disease and reconfiguring patterns in your brain it takes energy lots of it certain patterns are hard to achieve just like our certain configurations a heart of the human body is to bend and twist into so a lot of times that we fall back on configuration patterns that take the least energy breaking out of those patterns is often the first step in changing the way you think and it can even help unleash your creativity thankfully for me this kind of neural acrobatics is not correlated with my body's flexibility [Music]

Kids in the US seem to spend more hours in school than other students around the world. But does this idea really hold up? How do students in other countries spend their time, and what can the US learn from them? U.S. students spend more time in K-12 schools than their peers in many other countries A recent study by the Pew Research Center compared 'intended instructional time' among 33 countries including the US. Most US states require their public schools to have between 175 and 180 days of elementary schooling per year, depending on grade level. That translates into an average of 943 hours per year. The only countries where kids spent more time in elementary school each year were: Israel, Australia, Mexico and Chile. In middle school, the average time for US kids jumps up to 1,016 hours. With so much time spent in the classroom, it would seem kids in America should be among the highest achievers. But, that's not the case. In Japan and South Korea, kids spend an average of about 150 instructional hours less per year in school than their peers in the US. And yet, they consistently score higher on international tests. How is that possible? In both countries, competition to attend elite universities is extremely rigorous. It's common for students to get extra help with private tutoring and night classes, known as 'cram schools'. In Japan, 'cram schools' or jukus are offered to kids as young as four years old -- to help get them into private kindergartens. In South Korea, some cram schools stay open as late as 11pm, so high school students can better prepare for college entrance exams. These extra hours aren't counted as time spent in school, but evening classes are a huge part of a student's life. In US schools, kids typically start class early - between 7:30 and 8:00am. But in other countries like Germany and Finland where academic performance is high, school schedules and hours are more flexible. In Germany, the school day starts between 7:30 and 8:15 but finishes around noon or 1pm - a tradition that dates back 250 years. While US kids eat lunch at school and stay in class up to 4pm, in Germany, kids go home for lunch and don't return to school in the afternoon. Instead, they spend two to three hours each
day doing homework. The German school schedule might look appealing to American students, but it was rooted in the idea that mothers would be at home to help take care of the kids. Over the last decade, all-day schools have started to catch on, to match the German economy and working parents' schedules. In Finland, classes start between 8 and 9am and run until about 1 or 2 - with a hot lunch served every day and minimal homework after school. Teachers typically give kids a 15-minute break for every 45-minutes of instruction. Research has shown that frequent breaks keep students 'fresh' and more focused throughout the day. Kids in America may have longer, more rigid school schedules, but at least they can relax during a 10 week long summer break. Across Europe, summer breaks range from six weeks in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK to up to 13 weeks for kids in Italy and Portugal. It's commonly thought that the summer schedule was created to serve the American 'farm economy' so kids could join their families and work the fields. But that's a myth! Kids in rural areas took their breaks during the spring and the fall, when crops were planted, and then harvested and sold. Classes were held during the summer when kids weren't needed as much on the farm. The real reason for summer break? In cities, the summer heat drove kids out
of the sweltering classrooms -- and their families out of town to escape high temperatures. By the late 19th century, school reformers argued for standardization of the calendar across urban and rural areas - resulting in the modern school schedule. Today, across the US, officials are experimenting with all kinds of schedules like year-round classes or four-day weeks with longer hours Monday through Thursday. Over the last decade, enrollment in online schools has tripled - and an estimated two million kids are now being taught at home. Supporters of homeschooling say they can cover the same amount of material in half the time, allowing kids to participate in more extra-curricular activities Virtual classrooms and online technology are driving major changes in education, ones that could impact school schedules in a dramatic way. And that school bell? It might not ring as often -- or as long -- in the future. [MUSIC]

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as monkeypox, while the ground truth MCQ is related to the summer schedule and its origins.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that Question 2 is the closest match, but only because it has a similar format (True/False is not present, but it has a short question with multiple-choice options). However, please note that the content and intent of Question 2 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate answer would be "None of the above" or "No match found," as none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely.

this episode is sponsored by onedrive a subscription service where you can find the answer to everything you've ever wondered about and some things you never imagined you would wonder about head over to onedrive.com scishow for a free trial [Music] this month may 2022 more than 120 confirmed or suspected cases of a rare disease called monkey pox have been reported in countries like portugal spain the uk and the usa this means it is being detected outside its origins in central and western africa and in multiple unrelated places that's something that always gets the attention of public health authorities so what is monkey pox and why is it popping up now here is what we know monkey pox is a disease caused by a virus that is part of what's known as the ortho pox family which are brick or oval-shaped dna viruses the same family as cow pox and smallpox though not chickenpox it typically starts out with flu-like symptoms like fever chills and muscle aches as well as swollen lymph nodes a few days after the fever sets in the patient gets fluid-filled bumps on their skin these tend to be concentrated on the face and extremities including the palms and soles of the feet infections usually last about two to four weeks and there's an incubation period of often around one to two weeks before symptoms appear basically we know that monkeybox isn't a new disease experts have already been studying it for decades and it is a zoonotic disease that's one that is spread from animals to humans it's named monkey pox because it was discovered in research monkeys in the 1950s the natural reservoir is not known but its primary host is probably some sort of african rodent a person might catch it if they get scratched or bitten or if they eat undercooked contaminated meat from there monkey pox can be spread from person to person via contact with contaminated materials like bedding or towels bodily fluids respiratory secretions or the infectious fluid from the sores the first time it was documented in people was in 1970 in the democratic republic of the congo since then when it has cropped up in humans it's usually been in central and west africa mostly in rural rainforested regions however cases have been rising over the past couple of decades since 2017 there's been a particularly large ongoing outbreak in nigeria for instance and we've seen some travel related cases outside of africa in 2003 there was an outbreak in the u.s related to pet prairie dogs and imported exotic animals we don't know for sure why outbreaks are becoming more frequent it might be related to people coming into more contact with animals due to changing circumstances and habitat loss but it may also actually have to do with the death of smallpox because the smallpox vaccine can prevent monkey pox infection remember that smallpox and monkeypox are in the same viral family and up until around 40 years ago getting a smallpox vaccine was common but the disease in a marvelous feat of humanity was declared extinct in 1980 and since then vaccinations have mostly stopped today only around 30 of the people in the world have been vaccinated against smallpox that means over time as smallpox immunity waned monkeypox may have gained more opportunities to infect unprotected people in fact most of the people who've been infected were not vaccinated for smallpox so that's the run-up but what about the current outbreak that has appeared in europe and elsewhere outside of africa unfortunately some of this attention is just because like let's be honest infections are spreading to places that aren't africa but it's also a genuine concern because it's unusual to see it pop up in so many different places at once the first case was identified in may of 2022 and involved someone who had traveled to nigeria which is not unheard of but since then other cases have been identified where people hadn't traveled to endemic countries and exactly where or how they became infected isn't clear yet this suggests that there may have been either community or person-to-person transmission community transmission is when there isn't a clear contact point with someone who is infected and contagious and monkey pox lends itself to this since it can be spread via contaminated bedding towels toothbrushes or other not human contacts person-to-person transmission is of course like what it sounds like contact with an infected and contagious person spreads it to another person and this has been seen with monkey pox but outside of the places where the virus is endemic person-to-person transmission has only been documented once before and this spread outside its usual range is basically the big reason this is getting so much attention many of the current cases have been in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men however that could actually be a confounding factor not a clue that's because monkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection it does spread through close contact and sex certainly qualifies so some experts have speculated that could be aiding transmission but it's also likely that monkey pox is simply being spread in environments these people are congregating in and due to the history of hiv and aids they might just be a community more likely to notice infectious disease early that is why it's important for us to learn more about how this virus is spreading so that we can be sure we're catching all of the communities affected as for how deadly this outbreak is a draft of the current outbreak's genome has already been sequenced and it looks like it's related to the west african strain of the disease which has a fatality rate in endemic countries of about one percent and this is great news because the other option is a variant whose fatality rate is closer to 10 however that number may also not be applicable since the non-african countries it's popping up in have more medical resources at their disposal than the countries it is endemic to there haven't been any reported deaths in the u.s or europe yet and the good news is that vaccines and treatments do exist for smallpox like i said earlier smallpox vaccines provide some protection against monkeypox in fact they can even be given up to four days after exposure to monkeypox in what the experts call post-exposure prophylaxis antiviral drugs developed for smallpox are also effective of course once again this is an equity problem resource-rich nations like the us have stockpiles of smallpox vaccine that can be used to treat outbreaks while in central and west africa monkeypox is not quite business as usual but also not new indeed some african doctors have pinned their struggle to manage monkey box outbreaks on a lack of access to vaccines and treatments so to recap monkey pox is a disease we have known about for decades it's usually rare and crops up in rural rainforest regions of certain african countries but has become more frequent over the past couple decades maybe as a result of waning smallpox immunity now there is an outbreak outside of the countries we would normally expect in higher numbers than we'd expect a lot more investigation needs to be done to determine why and how it seems to be spreading more easily than it has in the past however treatments do exist and unlike most emerging infectious diseases we are not forced to start from scratch and of course we will update you if the situation gets worse so stay tuned and thanks for watching if you just learned something new about monkey pox you might not be surprised that there is a lot to learn and also correct from our previous understandings about other diseases like the black death like you might have thought that you knew all about the black death but scientists discovered that it was so deadly and fast spreading thanks to a bacterial mutation that happened a hundred years before the plague even got to europe those are the kind of new insights you can learn about from

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about monkeypox symptoms, while the generated MCQs are about venomous species, snakes, and other unrelated topics.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar in terms of format, but not in terms of content. 

However, since the question is asking about the index of the most similar generated MCQ, and there isn't one that matches the content, I would say that there isn't an index to provide.

If you could provide more generated MCQs that are related to the topic of monkeypox, I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

this episode is sponsored by onedrive a subscription service where you can find the answer to everything you've ever wondered about and some things you never imagined you would wonder about head over to onedrive.com scishow for a free trial [Music] this month may 2022 more than 120 confirmed or suspected cases of a rare disease called monkey pox have been reported in countries like portugal spain the uk and the usa this means it is being detected outside its origins in central and western africa and in multiple unrelated places that's something that always gets the attention of public health authorities so what is monkey pox and why is it popping up now here is what we know monkey pox is a disease caused by a virus that is part of what's known as the ortho pox family which are brick or oval-shaped dna viruses the same family as cow pox and smallpox though not chickenpox it typically starts out with flu-like symptoms like fever chills and muscle aches as well as swollen lymph nodes a few days after the fever sets in the patient gets fluid-filled bumps on their skin these tend to be concentrated on the face and extremities including the palms and soles of the feet infections usually last about two to four weeks and there's an incubation period of often around one to two weeks before symptoms appear basically we know that monkeybox isn't a new disease experts have already been studying it for decades and it is a zoonotic disease that's one that is spread from animals to humans it's named monkey pox because it was discovered in research monkeys in the 1950s the natural reservoir is not known but its primary host is probably some sort of african rodent a person might catch it if they get scratched or bitten or if they eat undercooked contaminated meat from there monkey pox can be spread from person to person via contact with contaminated materials like bedding or towels bodily fluids respiratory secretions or the infectious fluid from the sores the first time it was documented in people was in 1970 in the democratic republic of the congo since then when it has cropped up in humans it's usually been in central and west africa mostly in rural rainforested regions however cases have been rising over the past couple of decades since 2017 there's been a particularly large ongoing outbreak in nigeria for instance and we've seen some travel related cases outside of africa in 2003 there was an outbreak in the u.s related to pet prairie dogs and imported exotic animals we don't know for sure why outbreaks are becoming more frequent it might be related to people coming into more contact with animals due to changing circumstances and habitat loss but it may also actually have to do with the death of smallpox because the smallpox vaccine can prevent monkey pox infection remember that smallpox and monkeypox are in the same viral family and up until around 40 years ago getting a smallpox vaccine was common but the disease in a marvelous feat of humanity was declared extinct in 1980 and since then vaccinations have mostly stopped today only around 30 of the people in the world have been vaccinated against smallpox that means over time as smallpox immunity waned monkeypox may have gained more opportunities to infect unprotected people in fact most of the people who've been infected were not vaccinated for smallpox so that's the run-up but what about the current outbreak that has appeared in europe and elsewhere outside of africa unfortunately some of this attention is just because like let's be honest infections are spreading to places that aren't africa but it's also a genuine concern because it's unusual to see it pop up in so many different places at once the first case was identified in may of 2022 and involved someone who had traveled to nigeria which is not unheard of but since then other cases have been identified where people hadn't traveled to endemic countries and exactly where or how they became infected isn't clear yet this suggests that there may have been either community or person-to-person transmission community transmission is when there isn't a clear contact point with someone who is infected and contagious and monkey pox lends itself to this since it can be spread via contaminated bedding towels toothbrushes or other not human contacts person-to-person transmission is of course like what it sounds like contact with an infected and contagious person spreads it to another person and this has been seen with monkey pox but outside of the places where the virus is endemic person-to-person transmission has only been documented once before and this spread outside its usual range is basically the big reason this is getting so much attention many of the current cases have been in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men however that could actually be a confounding factor not a clue that's because monkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection it does spread through close contact and sex certainly qualifies so some experts have speculated that could be aiding transmission but it's also likely that monkey pox is simply being spread in environments these people are congregating in and due to the history of hiv and aids they might just be a community more likely to notice infectious disease early that is why it's important for us to learn more about how this virus is spreading so that we can be sure we're catching all of the communities affected as for how deadly this outbreak is a draft of the current outbreak's genome has already been sequenced and it looks like it's related to the west african strain of the disease which has a fatality rate in endemic countries of about one percent and this is great news because the other option is a variant whose fatality rate is closer to 10 however that number may also not be applicable since the non-african countries it's popping up in have more medical resources at their disposal than the countries it is endemic to there haven't been any reported deaths in the u.s or europe yet and the good news is that vaccines and treatments do exist for smallpox like i said earlier smallpox vaccines provide some protection against monkeypox in fact they can even be given up to four days after exposure to monkeypox in what the experts call post-exposure prophylaxis antiviral drugs developed for smallpox are also effective of course once again this is an equity problem resource-rich nations like the us have stockpiles of smallpox vaccine that can be used to treat outbreaks while in central and west africa monkeypox is not quite business as usual but also not new indeed some african doctors have pinned their struggle to manage monkey box outbreaks on a lack of access to vaccines and treatments so to

this episode is sponsored by onedrive a subscription service where you can find the answer to everything you've ever wondered about and some things you never imagined you would wonder about head over to onedrive.com scishow for a free trial [Music] this month may 2022 more than 120 confirmed or suspected cases of a rare disease called monkey pox have been reported in countries like portugal spain the uk and the usa this means it is being detected outside its origins in central and western africa and in multiple unrelated places that's something that always gets the attention of public health authorities so what is monkey pox and why is it popping up now here is what we know monkey pox is a disease caused by a virus that is part of what's known as the ortho pox family which are brick or oval-shaped dna viruses the same family as cow pox and smallpox though not chickenpox it typically starts out with flu-like symptoms like fever chills and muscle aches as well as swollen lymph nodes a few days after the fever sets in the patient gets fluid-filled bumps on their skin these tend to be concentrated on the face and extremities including the palms and soles of the feet infections usually last about two to four weeks and there's an incubation period of often around one to two weeks before symptoms appear basically we know that monkeybox isn't a new disease experts have already been studying it for decades and it is a zoonotic disease that's one that is spread from animals to humans it's named monkey pox because it was discovered in research monkeys in the 1950s the natural reservoir is not known but its primary host is probably some sort of african rodent a person might catch it if they get scratched or bitten or if they eat undercooked contaminated meat from there monkey pox can be spread from person to person via contact with contaminated materials like bedding or towels bodily fluids respiratory secretions or the infectious fluid from the sores the first time it was documented in people was in 1970 in the democratic republic of the congo since then when it has cropped up in humans it's usually been in central and west africa mostly in rural rainforested regions however cases have been rising over the past couple of decades since 2017 there's been a particularly large ongoing outbreak in nigeria for instance and we've seen some travel related cases outside of africa in 2003 there was an outbreak in the u.s related to pet prairie dogs and imported exotic animals we don't know for sure why outbreaks are becoming more frequent it might be related to people coming into more contact with animals due to changing circumstances and habitat loss but it may also actually have to do with the death of smallpox because the smallpox vaccine can prevent monkey pox infection remember that smallpox and monkeypox are in the same viral family and up until around 40 years ago getting a smallpox vaccine was common but the disease in a marvelous feat of humanity was declared extinct in 1980 and since then vaccinations have mostly stopped today only around 30 of the people in the world have been vaccinated against smallpox that means over time as smallpox immunity waned monkeypox may have gained more opportunities to infect unprotected people in fact most of the people who've been infected were not vaccinated for smallpox so that's the run-up but what about the current outbreak that has appeared in europe and elsewhere outside of africa unfortunately some of this attention is just because like let's be honest infections are spreading to places that aren't africa but it's also a genuine concern because it's unusual to see it pop up in so many different places at once the first case was identified in may of 2022 and involved someone who had traveled to nigeria which is not unheard of but since then other cases have been identified where people hadn't traveled to endemic countries and exactly where or how they became infected isn't clear yet this suggests that there may have been either community or person-to-person transmission community transmission is when there isn't a clear contact point with someone who is infected and contagious and monkey pox lends itself to this since it can be spread via contaminated bedding towels toothbrushes or other not human contacts person-to-person transmission is of course like what it sounds like contact with an infected and contagious person spreads it to another person and this has been seen with monkey pox but outside of the places where the virus is endemic person-to-person transmission has only been documented once before and this spread outside its usual range is basically the big reason this is getting so much attention many of the current cases have been in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men however that could actually be a confounding factor not a clue that's because monkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection it does spread through close contact and sex certainly qualifies so some experts have speculated that could be aiding transmission but it's also likely that monkey pox is simply being spread in environments these people are congregating in and due to the history of hiv and aids they might just be a community more likely to notice infectious disease early that is why it's important for us to learn more about how this virus is spreading so that we can be sure we're catching all of the communities affected as for how deadly this outbreak is a draft of the current outbreak's genome has already been sequenced and it looks like it's related to the west african strain of the disease which has a fatality rate in endemic countries of about one percent and this is great news because the other option is a variant whose fatality rate is closer to 10 however that number may also not be applicable since the non-african countries it's popping up in have more medical resources at their disposal than the countries it is endemic to there haven't been any reported deaths in the u.s or europe yet and the good news is that vaccines and treatments do exist for smallpox like i said earlier smallpox vaccines provide some protection against monkeypox in fact they can even be given up to four days after exposure to monkeypox in what the experts call post-exposure prophylaxis antiviral drugs developed for smallpox are also effective of course once again this is an equity problem resource-rich nations like the us have stockpiles of smallpox vaccine that can be used to treat outbreaks while in central and west africa monkeypox is not quite business as usual but also not new indeed some african doctors have pinned their struggle to manage monkey box outbreaks on a lack of access to vaccines and treatments so to recap monkey pox is a disease we have known about for decades it's usually rare and crops up in rural rainforest regions of certain african countries but has become more frequent over the past couple decades maybe as a result of waning smallpox immunity now there is an outbreak outside of the countries we would normally expect in higher numbers than we'd expect a lot more investigation needs to be done to determine why and how it seems to be spreading more easily than it has in the past however treatments do exist and unlike most emerging infectious diseases we are not forced to start from scratch and of course we will update you if the situation gets worse so stay tuned and thanks for watching if you just learned something new about monkey pox you might not be surprised that there is a lot to learn and also correct from our previous understandings about other diseases like the black death like you might have thought that you knew all about the black death but scientists discovered that it was so deadly and fast spreading thanks to a bacterial mutation that happened a hundred years before the plague even got to europe those are the kind of new insights you can learn about from

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life.

So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide an explanation for this mismatch.

The ground truth MCQ is about the term for an organism whose body temperature is regulated by its surroundings. The correct answer is "ectotherm." However, none of the generated MCQs cover this topic or have similar options.

The generated MCQs seem to be related to coral reefs, climate change, and marine biology, which is not relevant to the ground truth MCQ. Therefore, I couldn't find a match between the ground truth MCQ and any of the generated MCQs.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no match, and the generated MCQs need to be revised or new ones need to be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this.

It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective.

If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is.

Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...

As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species.

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom.

My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

**Transcript**:
when the French BNP paribas Bank Foundation asked if they could pay me to make a video that promotes the research that they fund and to climate change in coral reefs I was interested when they then said that they've given me a camera crew and fly me out to a tropical island paradise to go filming in the reefs strangely enough I said yes [Music] tropical reefs like tropical rainforests are found in a belt all around the equator the most famous is the Great Barrier Reef but there's also another surrounding a group of volcanic islands in the middle of the Pacific and I'm on this island Maria [Music] coral reefs are the tropical rainforests of the sea they are super biodiverse ecosystems in fact by some measures they are the most biodiverse ecosystem on the planet a cover less than 1% of the seafloor and yet a home to 25% of all marine life and this biodiversity benefits humans coral reefs can reduce the energy in the waves by up to 97% protecting 200 million people around the world from coastal flooding and hurricanes 1 billion people that's one in seven of the world's population have some dependence on the reefs for food in fishing adding in the benefits from tourism and new medicines it's estimated that coral reefs benefit the global economy by 30 billion dollars each year now as I'm sure you've heard in the news time time again coral reefs are under threat they're bleaching they're dying they're going to go extinct mister by 2050 and short or reversing global warming there's nothing we can do about it but the trouble is that's not quite true and it turns out that coral reefs aren't quite as doomed as we've been led to believe corals are weird animals although they look like rocky plants they're actually an animal and an algae in an interdependent relationship so I headed to the Korea Research Center to chat to coral expert dr. Leticia headway to find out more but what is this yeah and so what we do here is that we can look really in detail yeah look like every time you see like a small 10sec yes a different product oh yeah with a little tentacle yeah it's alive it isn't you even tell me it's alive it is alive so can we zoom in quite on one of these polyps so if you look closer like you can see how your turns occur like it's full of drowned out yeah it's not a solid brown yeah it's like a sampling so this is something that provides okay so the the algae the zoo's anthalie is brown yeah and that's photosynthesizing yeah so that'll give the sugar to the animal yep what does the polyp give to the algae so we provide like a shelter and Angie also use some waste of the garage I do okay so it's really what we call our music symbiosis now it's an exchange between boss organism and it's beneficial for both of them so you can probably say that this is an animal with a plant inside of it yeah you can see it all on this massive it's what calcium carbonate yeah yeah that's really cool first the corn you would start just with one product okay so there are we will swim in the water and at some point to find a good spot to set up yeah be just set up and they start building the skeleton so first you start with one per deep and then the curl will grow and the product will divide divide divide and then you have thousands of products that compose one coral colony so it is just one one polyp will then divide asexually yeah so that it's like each polyp is almost like the cells in our body yeah making up the whole except that each polyp has its own set of cells yeah so it's like a level above what humans say yeah it's very an amazing anyway yeah that you did I mean now you have convinced no because when you go to a coral reef you think oh look at the lovely fish look at the sharks look at the Rays and the whales and like oh there happens to be some coral in the background so no I'm sure that when you will die you will look at look at current defenses I think I will this is a great thank you speaking of diving you may not know that I'm actually a qualified scuba diver so PhD student nina here offered to teach me about fish and corals by taking me out diving look how happy she looks about this I on the other hand hadn't died in the ten years since qualifying so needless to say I was a bit apprehensive I say here that I'm feeling okay I was not feeling okay what's the problem what's her troops wearing our precious reefs Venus the biggest global problem is definitely temperature rise if you imagine global change in the air the oceans are absorbing a more a lot more heat than the air so the effect is bigger in in the oceans but on their on the reefs a little bit of temperature rise already affects them you have the algae living inside corals yeah they get yeah they get expelled when when they get too stressed and what actually causes the bleaching because you've got this animal with a symbiotic relationship with this is anthalie algae yeah why when it gets hot did they get rid of the algae there you have the algae inside living inside the corals and when it gets warm they start to behave differently and the corals don't like it so the they actually expel coral is an animal yeah and they expel the algae and if it doesn't like then and then the coral becomes white but it's not that yet it just doesn't have the algae but if the algae don't come back he's gonna starve so it's gonna die eventually but if it's if this is short and the coral is just wide enough that it can recover if the algae come back in time but if the heating for example takes too much time it won't recover and it will starve and die and so on or else you're gonna over grow the dead coral and I dismiss so white coral isn't necessarily dead coral no like very clean white coral is not that yet now on a global scale the problem is we had a massive bleaching event in 2016 but now in 2007 there was a second one so the reef is recovering at some place you see this small recruits then they get bleached again so like if it's gonna continue like this there's no way some of the important corals are gonna recover if bleached corals are not dead corals and in fact corals can recover from bleaching well why are we so worried about bleaching events let's hit the beach the problem with coral bleaching events isn't so much the severity I mean don't get me wrong the severity is bad but is the frequency that's been changing in the last few years there's been causing the problems so let's draw a graph on the x-axis we've got time and on the y-axis we've got the percentage of healthy coral cover so naturally before a bleaching event the coral will be at 100% healthy cover then 1998 was the first time we had ever seen a mass global horribly chin event before they've been just localized to Sun reefs but this was the first time it was all over the world and so the healthy coral cover dropped but what many people don't realize about these events is that corals can recover and give them about ten years or so and the corals will come back to the same species richness the same number of species as they had the thought and so the coral comes back to normal but then in 2010 there was another El Nino another mass bleaching event and once again the coral cover stopped it but once again the coral started to grow back and everything was going fine until then in 2015 just five years after the 2010 event there was another mass event and then 2016 was the worst world had ever seen which saw some reefs going down to 90% of the coral was bleached 2017 we had another bleaching event and so it's not these corals can't recover if given the time they're just not getting the time they need to come back to normal the only way that we can stop these coral bleaching events from occurring is to reverse global climate change which is going to be difficult what we can do is change how fast the corals bounce back whether they can recover quickly whether they recover slowly all right now they don't recover at all how fast the corals can recover and get back to their normal state that is called resilience it turns out we're able to change how resilient the reefs are for example by changing how we fish which is exactly what Nina is studying and I promise that this time you get to see me go scuba diving we're gonna look at the role of fishes and how climate change affects how the roles of the fishes changed as well so basically we're gonna try to quantify why fish matter on the reef why do you fish matter yeah a lot of reasons so we have ecosystem processes and ecosystem services ecosystem processes are like how much do the herbivores eat so how much algae can they take up to sustain the reef then you have ecosystem services like biomass production for fishing or the composition of nutrients inside the fish for further humans when there's a coral bleaching or massive die-off you have these fields of dead corals covered that are getting covered in algae but then if the fish quickly start to target all the algae that are growing on corals they can recover more easily than if there's reproduction off girls like the tiny baby corals they can find a place to settle they clean all of the nasty dead stuff yeah they clean the dead reef the fish are changing how easy it is for the coral to recover from a bleaching event yes so they're really important there are really important yeah and a day I'm assuming that there are some that are more important than others that you have your keystone species well we already know that parrotfish and surgeon fish are important for the herbivory part huh because yeah that's those are the guys and I'm gonna eat the turf algae and keep the keep the algae short enough for the reef to recover more easily cool right when I knew that I was coming to Polynesia the only thing I had to do whilst I was there was go scuba diving on the reefs when the time came though I was terrified the combination of being on camera fear of seasickness everyone around me giving instructions in French and that I hadn't dived in 10 years I'd never dived in the open sea and had never died from a boat that's all that was going through my head at this point [Music] [Music] okay we're not gonna be able to speak underwater yeah we need to work out a way of communicating okay what this is a coral that's covered in turf algae okay that's gonna turn gray parrot fish okay parrotfish [Music] joy shark [Music] oh my goodness oh this is so much going on to think about the same time good obviously the scuba-diving side of thing is good sure having never typed in the middle of the season fours but then also there's so many corals fish two species of shark lemon shark and the black tip reef shark and it's just we're just saying yeah how healthy the corals eyes incredible compared to what leavened I mean it's just as far as you can see everything is covered in healthy coral that's hardly any algae a few bleached ones but really not that many and just so many colors as well just one note algae are not always bad yes they're part of the national system also yeah just when dlg take over exactly yeah but yeah it was nice there were love life corals I was impressed yeah oh so much to take it ones is there anything that we can do then to help the reefs out when it comes to if we are fishing and that's gonna change the ecosystem of the reason is there something we can do to not affect very so badly yes we can change fisheries try to change fisheries try to influence the local people try to influence the big economic fisheries to not target the key species yeah and also try to not change the size structure of fish that we used to have a lot of a lot more bigger fish and our basically fishing down the food webs so we're removing the big ones because if you have the same biomass or big fish and the same biomass of small fish same species the roles on the reef are gonna change drastically for example if we go to the bio roading parrotfish fish 50 centimeter can remove 30 times more than a fish of 25 centimeters for example so that's massive so doubling in size produces 30 times more yes have every yeah that's a play in this particularly is that one species yes fishing isn't the only way we can change a reefs resilience we can also change the resilience of the corals themselves one of Leticia's experiments is to break off fragments of corals that have survived a bleaching and grow them up like plant cuttings in a coral garden for three years as she's about to show me we have three different genera of coral when akrura want varieties and one proceed abrupt so you took a coral you broke it Brooks about piece and right now what on the one line you can see that several clone that are left from that colony but generally you can see for some colony a huge variability in the size that they have some a very big and the other one is very small like three four or five times bigger like not a small difference in size or one property yeah big in another really small it's the same coral that you split up at the same time you're growing it in the same place but there's so different yeah it was very surprising we thought we had grown and all the clone of the same colony would behave the same way with time and we will see difference in the crowd and we think that it depends from where the fragment of the colony were collected why would the coral from one part of the animal behave so differently to another part of it is the same car it's the same animal yeah nobody it's genetically the same but we know that the community of Xanterra in coral could change depending of whether or not they have they receive a height impact from the light if it's on the top or it's kind of shadow when it's at the bottom so that could play a key role on the same uranium community and because the same uranium drj provides energy perhaps some of betters of Xanterra from growing than the other one so that's one of the hybrid is also you've got some bits will have been broken off from shady parts of the corals some from really sunny parts and that will then change how they then go on to grow that could that's so interesting so here you've got two different experiments going on yeah you've got you're taking a colony you're splitting it up into clothes yeah and then you're observing it as the natural stressors happen yeah and then you've also got your selective breeding which is like modern farming technique produces the most milk yeah how do you go about selectively breeding a coral what we do is that we bring back piece of coral at the crib in the laboratory and so and then every every every night we're gonna watch man starting from 8:00 p.m. to midnight because we spawn at night we collect directly the package from each colony and then we separate them and then we we have eggs and sperm from different colonies and then what we do is that we kind of do like we can mix together in some little tube or stuff like that and so we can release array which hex will go with which pair what is it you're actually looking for like which more how do you know the coral has passed the test and that's the one that you're gonna continue it so yeah right now the past test was whether you were able to resist to temperature or not in the past so that was really whether they were resistant or not to temperature and we will mix eggs and spam from Weiner colony and see whether we can get winner lovely so the idea is trying to restore area with code that will be able to face the increase of sea water temperature and with all this information is the ultimate goal to be able to repopulate wild reefs with corals that you know to be resilient yeah that's the big idea but just to be realistic we won't be able to restore for example all the reef in Moorea so the idea is more to restore like some area some small area that would kind of hacked as a source of lava and that will be able then to kind of naturally colonize other over reef as long as the small part is yeah yeah yeah oh for the reefs here in Moorea seem to be faring a lot better than the reefs elsewhere in the world although that probably says a lot more about how bad things are in the rest of the world than how good things are here let's face it global warming is the number one threat to coral reefs and fixing global warming as soon as possible should be our number one priority but it has been really interesting to hear that there are some things that we can do to help the reefs before we fully fixed global warming before we've eradicated bleaching events by improving the coral reefs resilience whether that's not fishing the largest parrot fish so that bleached corals have time to recover before they're covered in algae or whether that's researching what makes individual corals more resistant to bleaching so that we can breed those and repopulate dead reefs with those all of the scientists I've spoken to here said that they don't think that coral reefs are going to go extinct by 2050 but they might become a shadow of their former selves a less diverse a less complex ecosystem and so it's time that we appreciate how lucky we are to have reefs right now and by right now I mean right now so if you don't mind I'm going for it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

apprehensive I say here that I'm feeling okay I was not feeling okay what's the problem what's her troops wearing our precious reefs Venus the biggest global problem is definitely temperature rise if you imagine global change in the air the oceans are absorbing a more a lot more heat than the air so the effect is bigger in in the oceans but on their on the reefs a little bit of temperature rise already affects them you have the algae living inside corals yeah they get yeah they get expelled when when they get too stressed and what actually causes the bleaching because you've got this animal with a symbiotic relationship with this is anthalie algae yeah why when it gets hot did they get rid of the algae there you have the algae inside living inside the corals and when it gets warm they start to behave differently and the corals don't like it so the they actually expel coral is an animal yeah and they expel the algae and if it doesn't like then and then the coral becomes white but it's not that yet it just doesn't have the algae but if the algae don't come back he's gonna starve so it's gonna die eventually but if it's if this is short and the coral is just wide enough that it can recover if the algae come back in time but if the heating for example takes too much time it won't recover and it will starve and die and so on or else you're gonna over grow the dead coral and I dismiss so white coral isn't necessarily dead coral no like very clean white coral is not that yet now on a global scale the problem is we had a massive bleaching event in 2016 but now in 2007 there was a second one so the reef is recovering at some place you see this small recruits then they get bleached again so like if it's gonna continue like this there's no way some of the important corals are gonna recover if bleached corals are not dead corals and in fact corals can recover from bleaching well why are we so worried about bleaching events let's hit the beach the problem with coral bleaching events isn't so much the severity I mean don't get me wrong the severity is bad but is the frequency that's been changing in the last few years there's been causing the problems so let's draw a graph on the x-axis we've got time and on the y-axis we've got the percentage of healthy coral cover so naturally before a bleaching event the coral will be at 100% healthy cover then 1998 was the first time we had ever seen a mass global horribly chin event before they've been just localized to Sun reefs but this was the first time it was all over the world and so the healthy coral cover dropped but what many people don't realize about these events is that corals can recover and give them about ten years or so and the corals will come back to the same species richness the same number of species as they had the thought and so the coral comes back to normal but then in 2010 there was another El Nino another mass bleaching event and once again the coral cover stopped it but once again the coral started to grow back and everything was going fine until then in 2015 just five years after the 2010 event there was another mass event and then 2016 was the worst world had ever seen which saw some reefs going down to 90% of the coral was bleached 2017 we had another bleaching event and so it's not these corals can't recover if given the time they're just not getting the time they need to come back to normal the only way that we can stop these coral bleaching events from occurring is to reverse global climate change which is going to be difficult what we can do is change how fast the corals bounce back whether they can recover quickly whether they recover slowly all right now they don't recover at all how fast the corals can recover and get back to their normal state that is called resilience it turns out we're able to change how resilient the reefs are for example by changing how we fish which is exactly what Nina is studying and I promise that this time you get to see me go scuba diving we're gonna look at the role of fishes and how climate change affects how the roles of the fishes changed as well so basically we're gonna try to quantify why fish matter on the reef why do you fish matter yeah a lot of reasons so we have ecosystem processes and ecosystem services ecosystem processes are like how much do the herbivores eat so how much algae can they take up to sustain the reef then you have ecosystem services like biomass production for fishing or the composition of nutrients inside the fish for further humans when there's a coral bleaching or massive die-off you have these fields of dead corals covered that are getting covered in algae but then if the fish quickly start to target all the algae that are growing on corals they can recover more easily than if there's reproduction off girls like the tiny baby corals they can find a place to settle they clean all of the nasty dead stuff yeah they clean the dead reef the fish are changing how easy it is for the coral to recover from a bleaching event yes so they're really important there are really important yeah and a day I'm assuming that there are some that are more important than others that you have your keystone species well we already know that parrotfish and surgeon fish are important for the herbivory part huh because yeah that's those are the guys and I'm gonna eat the turf algae and keep the keep the algae short enough for the reef to recover more easily cool right when I knew that I was coming to Polynesia the only thing I had to do whilst I was there was go scuba diving on the reefs when the time came though I was terrified the combination of being on camera fear of seasickness everyone around me giving instructions in French and that I hadn't dived in 10 years I'd never dived in the open sea and had never died from a boat that's all that was going through my head at this point [Music] [Music] okay we're not gonna be able to speak underwater yeah we need to work out a way of communicating okay what this is a coral that's covered in turf algae okay that's gonna turn gray parrot fish okay parrotfish [Music] joy shark [Music] oh my goodness oh this is so much going on to think about the same time good obviously the scuba-diving side of thing is good sure having never typed in the middle of the season fours but then also there's so many corals fish two species of shark lemon shark and the black tip reef shark and it's just we're just saying yeah how healthy the corals eyes incredible compared to what leavened I mean it's just as far as you can see everything is covered in healthy coral that's hardly any algae a few bleached ones but really not that many and just so many colors as well just one note algae are not always bad yes they're part of the national system also yeah just when dlg take over exactly yeah but yeah it was nice there were love life corals I was impressed yeah oh so much to take it ones is there anything that we can do then to help the reefs out when it comes to if we are fishing and that's gonna change the ecosystem of the reason is there something we can do to not affect very so badly yes we can change fisheries try to change fisheries try to influence the local people try to influence the big economic fisheries to not target the key species yeah and also try to not change the size structure of fish that we used to have a lot of a lot more bigger fish and our basically fishing down the food webs so we're removing the big ones because if you have the same biomass or big fish and the same biomass of small fish same species the roles on the reef are gonna change drastically for example if we go to the bio roading parrotfish fish 50 centimeter can remove 30 times more than a fish of 25 centimeters for example so that's massive so doubling in size produces 30 times more yes have every yeah that's a play in this particularly is that one species yes fishing isn't the only way we can change a reefs resilience we can also change the resilience of the corals themselves one of Leticia's experiments is to break off fragments of corals that have survived a bleaching and grow them up like plant cuttings in a coral garden for three years as she's about to show me we have three different genera of coral when akrura want varieties and one proceed abrupt so you took a coral you broke it Brooks about piece and right now what on the one line you can see that several clone that are left from that colony but generally you can see for some colony a huge variability in the size that they have some a very big and the other one is very small like three four or five times bigger like not a small difference in size or one property yeah big in another really small it's the same coral that you split up at the same time you're growing it in the same place but there's so different yeah it was very surprising we thought we had grown and all the clone of the same colony would behave the same way with time and we will see difference in the crowd and we think that it depends from where the fragment of the colony were collected why would the coral from one part of the animal behave so differently to another part of it is the same car it's the same animal yeah nobody it's genetically the same but we know that the community of Xanterra in coral could change depending of whether or not they have they receive a height impact from the light if it's on the top or it's kind of shadow when it's at the bottom so that could play a key role on the same uranium community and because the same uranium drj provides energy perhaps some of betters of Xanterra from growing than the other one so that's one of the hybrid is also you've got some bits will have been broken off from shady parts of the corals some from really sunny parts and that will then change how they then go on to grow that could that's so interesting so here you've got two different experiments going on yeah you've got you're taking a colony you're splitting it up into clothes yeah and then you're observing it as the natural stressors happen yeah and then you've also got your selective breeding which is like modern farming technique produces the most milk yeah how do you go about selectively breeding a coral what we do is that we bring back piece of coral at the crib in the laboratory and so and then every every every night we're gonna watch man starting from 8:00 p.m. to midnight because we spawn at night we collect directly the package from each colony and then we separate them and then we we have eggs and sperm from different colonies and then what we do is that we kind of do like we can mix together in some little tube or stuff like that and so we can release array which hex will go with which pair what is it you're actually looking for like which more how do you know the coral has passed the test and that's the one that you're gonna continue it so yeah right now the past test was whether you were able to resist to temperature or not in the past so that was really whether they were resistant or not to temperature and we will mix eggs and spam from Weiner colony and see whether we can get winner lovely so the idea is trying to restore area with code that will be able to face the increase of sea water temperature and with all this information is the ultimate goal to be able to repopulate wild reefs with corals that you know to be resilient yeah that's the big idea but just to be realistic we won't be able to restore for example all the reef in Moorea so the idea is more to restore like some area some small area that would kind of hacked as a source of lava and that will be able then to kind of naturally colonize other over reef as long as the small part is yeah yeah yeah oh for the reefs here in Moorea seem to be faring a lot better than the reefs elsewhere in the world although that probably says a lot more about how bad things are in the rest of the world than how good things are here let's face it global warming is the number one threat to coral reefs and fixing global warming as soon as possible should be our number one priority but it has been really interesting to hear that there are some things that we can do to help the reefs before we fully fixed global warming before we've eradicated bleaching events by improving the coral reefs resilience whether that's not fishing the largest parrot fish so that bleached corals have time to recover before they're covered in algae or whether that's researching what makes individual corals more resistant to bleaching so that we can breed those and repopulate dead reefs with those all of the scientists I've spoken to here said that they don't think that coral reefs are going to go extinct by 2050 but they might become a shadow of their former selves a less diverse a less complex ecosystem and so it's time that we appreciate how lucky we are to have reefs right now and by right now I mean right now so if you don't mind I'm going for it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

Matching Response:
After reviewing the generated MCQs, I found that none of them exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about the relationship between the size of a parrotfish and its herbivory. The correct answer is "30x", indicating that a doubling in size produces 30 times more herbivory.

Among the generated MCQs, I found that none of them directly address this topic. However, I can suggest that the closest match is not available, as the generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the topic of coral reefs and parrotfish.

If I had to choose, I would say that there is no matching generated MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as genetics and ancestry.

**Transcript**:
This is you. And these are your ancestors, a huge pyramid
stretching into the past and balancing right on your head. How many ancestors do you have? Well, you have two parents. Four grandparents. And eight great-grandparents. Four generations back, your direct ancestors
total 30. If we continue down this line, doubling every
step, just 40 generations ago we’d find a trillion ancestors, all living *at the same
time*. Which is… ridiculous. That’s not only more people than have ever
been alive, it’s more stars than are in the Milky Way. Since our species came on the scene 200,000
years ago, there’ve been maybe 7 or 8 *thousand* generations of humans leading up to… you. So where are all your missing ancestors? Clearly, there’s been some inbreeding. [OPEN] We’re not talking banjo-playing, King-of-Spain,
Cersei-Jamie inbreeding, but every family tree inevitably grows forks. Before Tinder, choices for mates were
often limited to as far as you could walk. Even people like Charles Darwin and Albert
Einstein married their first cousins. Because so many people with shared ancestors
have reproduced, our number of actual ancestors is much smaller than what simple math tells
us. If we replace that with fancy math, factoring
in how people moved and lived and paired up… life expectancy, trade, geography, Genghis
Khan… we find something interesting: every human alive today shares a common ancestor
in their family tree, and this person lived only around 3,000 years ago. That’s right, next time you get in a fight
with a stranger on the internet, just remember that you share the same great great great
great great (fast foward) great grandfather or grandmother. But we don’t know who that person was. The math tells us they must have existed,
but they didn’t leave fossils or artifacts. Or like, a note or something. Though, writing birthday cards for each of
their 7.4 Billion great great great great great (fast forward) great grandchildren would
have been nice gesture. But we all carry a record of our ancestors
in our genes. Because DNA is copied over and over, every
so often a mistake is written in. You know how when you make a copy of a copy,
it’s doesn't come out as sharp? Like that, but since most of our DNA can be
changed without affecting how things work, many of these mutations slip through to the
next generation. These genetic changes accumulate at a steady
rate through time, so scientists can read them like a molecular clock, and estimate
how much time has passed. And which changes individuals share tell us
how closely or distantly related they are. Humans *seem* really different, but on a DNA
level we’re remarkably similar. Groups of chimps in Central Africa, living
right next to each other, show more genetic variation than we find in the entire human
population. This genetic similarity tells us that our
species is new, in the big scheme of things, and that at one point our population was small,
maybe as few as 10,000 of us. To put that in perspective, that’s only
a third of your average Bruce Springsteen crowd. Sorry Boss. Today, any two humans only differ by about
1 out of 1000 DNA base pairs. But our genome is so big, that’s still millions
of single letter differences, or SNPs, for “single nucleotide polymorphism”. We tend to see combinations of these changes,
chunks of SNPs, associated with different geographic locations. Companies that test your DNA ancestry read
thousands of these single letter changes in your genome, to make a sort of signature of
your unique genetic variation. Then they compare your signature to thousands
of reference individuals from various parts of the world, and do a bunch of fancy math
to see which parts of your genome most likely came from certain geographic areas. My genetic results: Pretty much look like
this. My ancNewsprestors, on both sides of my family,
are from Northern Europe and Scandinavia, which explains my last name, why I’m tall,
why I don’t tan, and also why I carry more Neanderthal DNA than 2/3rds of people. Confused why I have Neanderthal DNA? You should watch our last video. I didn’t
find any surprises, but many people learn about ancestry they didn’t know they had. Where we come from isn’t always obvious
on the outside, but DNA doesn’t lie. Before, using math, we identified an ancestor,
not too long ago, that’s related to all of us. But that person’s genetic influence has
been shuffled so much it’s invisible in our DNA today. Is there someone whose genes have been passed
on, unbroken, to today? Some leftover fingerprint from the mother
of everyone alive? There is. You have a 47th chromosome. It lives in mitochondria, the POWERHOUSE OF
THE CELL! – so we’re doing that again? Ok–mitochondria used to be free-swimming. They have their own genetic material. Unlike your other 46 chromosomes, there’s
no shuffling when it’s passed between generations. What’s more, all your mitochondria came
from your mother’s egg, not your father’s sperm. They trace an unbroken line of ancestors stretching
back through every female in your family tree. By comparing the changes that have accumulated
over the millennia, we find the most ancient human mitochondrial DNA comes from Africa,
where our species originated. We can even trace it back to one woman, about
150,000 years ago. Other Homo sapiens females lived alongside
her, but only her lineage lives on today, all other Homo sapiens lineages are extinct. This is mitochondrial Eve. And every single one of us, descend from her. In the truest sense, we really are family. Even if we’re just hundredth cousins or
something. But our ancestry isn’t just branches stretching
into the past, it’s also a tree that extends into the future. Today we have more power to mold that future,
down to the genetic level, than we’ve ever had before. So what might our species’ future look like? Next time. Stay curious. This video is part of a special series we’re
doing about the story of our species: Where we came from, how we’re all connected, and
where we’re going. If you haven’t already, check out part 1
and 2 to trace the fossils in our family tree and learn why we’re the only humans left. And be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss

of reference individuals from various parts of the world, and do a bunch of fancy math
to see which parts of your genome most likely came from certain geographic areas. My genetic results: Pretty much look like
this. My ancNewsprestors, on both sides of my family,
are from Northern Europe and Scandinavia, which explains my last name, why I’m tall,
why I don’t tan, and also why I carry more Neanderthal DNA than 2/3rds of people. Confused why I have Neanderthal DNA? You should watch our last video. I didn’t
find any surprises, but many people learn about ancestry they didn’t know they had. Where we come from isn’t always obvious
on the outside, but DNA doesn’t lie. Before, using math, we identified an ancestor,
not too long ago, that’s related to all of us. But that person’s genetic influence has
been shuffled so much it’s invisible in our DNA today. Is there someone whose genes have been passed
on, unbroken, to today? Some leftover fingerprint from the mother
of everyone alive? There is. You have a 47th chromosome. It lives in mitochondria, the POWERHOUSE OF
THE CELL! – so we’re doing that again? Ok–mitochondria used to be free-swimming. They have their own genetic material. Unlike your other 46 chromosomes, there’s
no shuffling when it’s passed between generations. What’s more, all your mitochondria came
from your mother’s egg, not your father’s sperm. They trace an unbroken line of ancestors stretching
back through every female in your family tree. By comparing the changes that have accumulated
over the millennia, we find the most ancient human mitochondrial DNA comes from Africa,
where our species originated. We can even trace it back to one woman, about
150,000 years ago. Other Homo sapiens females lived alongside
her, but only her lineage lives on today, all other Homo sapiens lineages are extinct. This is mitochondrial Eve. And every single one of us, descend from her. In the truest sense, we really are family. Even if we’re just hundredth cousins or
something. But our ancestry isn’t just branches stretching
into the past, it’s also a tree that extends into the future. Today we have more power to mold that future,
down to the genetic level, than we’ve ever had before. So what might our species’ future look like? Next time. Stay curious. This video is part of a special series we’re
doing about the story of our species: Where we came from, how we’re all connected, and

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as creativity, problem-solving, and brain function, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to human ancestry and genetics.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match. This question has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question statement and multiple-choice options. However, the content and intent of the question are still quite different.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6 (although it's not a good match)

Note: It would be better to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of human ancestry and genetics, rather than trying to match the ground truth MCQ with the existing generated MCQs.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
This is you. And these are your ancestors, a huge pyramid
stretching into the past and balancing right on your head. How many ancestors do you have? Well, you have two parents. Four grandparents. And eight great-grandparents. Four generations back, your direct ancestors
total 30. If we continue down this line, doubling every
step, just 40 generations ago we’d find a trillion ancestors, all living *at the same
time*. Which is… ridiculous. That’s not only more people than have ever
been alive, it’s more stars than are in the Milky Way. Since our species came on the scene 200,000
years ago, there’ve been maybe 7 or 8 *thousand* generations of humans leading up to… you. So where are all your missing ancestors? Clearly, there’s been some inbreeding. [OPEN] We’re not talking banjo-playing, King-of-Spain,
Cersei-Jamie inbreeding, but every family tree inevitably grows forks. Before Tinder, choices for mates were
often limited to as far as you could walk. Even people like Charles Darwin and Albert
Einstein married their first cousins. Because so many people with shared ancestors
have reproduced, our number of actual ancestors is much smaller than what simple math tells
us. If we replace that with fancy math, factoring
in how people moved and lived and paired up… life expectancy, trade, geography, Genghis
Khan… we find something interesting: every human alive today shares a common ancestor
in their family tree, and this person lived only around 3,000 years ago. That’s right, next time you get in a fight
with a stranger on the internet, just remember that you share the same great great great
great great (fast foward) great grandfather or grandmother. But we don’t know who that person was. The math tells us they must have existed,
but they didn’t leave fossils or artifacts. Or like, a note or something. Though, writing birthday cards for each of
their 7.4 Billion great great great great great (fast forward) great grandchildren would
have been nice gesture. But we all carry a record of our ancestors
in our genes. Because DNA is copied over and over, every
so often a mistake is written in. You know how when you make a copy of a copy,
it’s doesn't come out as sharp? Like that, but since most of our DNA can be
changed without affecting how things work, many of these mutations slip through to the
next generation. These genetic changes accumulate at a steady
rate through time, so scientists can read them like a molecular clock, and estimate
how much time has passed. And which changes individuals share tell us
how closely or distantly related they are. Humans *seem* really different, but on a DNA
level we’re remarkably similar. Groups of chimps in Central Africa, living
right next to each other, show more genetic variation than we find in the entire human
population. This genetic similarity tells us that our
species is new, in the big scheme of things, and that at one point our population was small,
maybe as few as 10,000 of us. To put that in perspective, that’s only
a third of your average Bruce Springsteen crowd. Sorry Boss. Today, any two humans only differ by about
1 out of 1000 DNA base pairs. But our genome is so big, that’s still millions
of single letter differences, or SNPs, for “single nucleotide polymorphism”. We tend to see combinations of these changes,
chunks of SNPs, associated with different geographic locations. Companies that test your DNA ancestry read
thousands of these single letter changes in your genome, to make a sort of signature of
your unique genetic variation. Then they compare your signature to thousands
of reference individuals from various parts of the world, and do a bunch of fancy math
to see which parts of your genome most likely came from certain geographic areas. My genetic results: Pretty much look like
this. My ancNewsprestors, on both sides of my family,

**Transcript**:
So I need you to answer a question – you
only have five seconds to respond and you can have as many answers as you like… Ready? How many uses can you think of for this brick? This is an alternative uses test, they’re
used to measure creative thinking and how flexible people are in approaching a task. Here’s one of the tests I prepared earlier… “Yeah, you could um, you could make very
interesting cookie patterns, I guess?” “You could use it as you would a domino
in a rube goldberg machine” “You could put it in a tin can and make
a rattle out of it” Where creativity comes from has mystified
us for centuries. Throughout history, we believed that creativity
was rare and seen in a small elite: professional painters, poets, performers, and musicians. For a long time, creativity was an enigma,
beyond the reach of science. But today, we know that it takes creativity
to solve problems, it’s an aspect of human intelligence. We find creativity in architecture, science,
engineering and even in nature. Creativity is everywhere! And in the past few decades, there have been
dozens of studies exploring it using brain imaging technology. We’ve found you don’t just use the left
or right hemisphere of your brain when you’re thinking creatively. There isn’t one single brain area or circuit
for creativity – professional artists suffering from damage to different brain regions continue
to produce art showing similar creativity. Over forty different areas of the brain are
likely involved with creativity. I could list them all for you, but your mind
might start to wander... Which might be a good thing! Humans spend an average of 30% of our day
engaged in "mind-wandering." A lot of these studies say that mind wandering
helps get our creativity flowing. But… why? How can we not pay attention and manage to
hit on an idea that’s just right? Some scientists think that mind-wandering
might distract you from your perceived obstacles or it may allow your subconscious to keep
working on the problem without your higher cognitive functions getting involved. Mind wandering may also promote your brain's
ability to restructure the way you look at a problem, perhaps you’ll make connections
between two seemingly unrelated things and come up with novel, creative solutions. “Oh! You could melt it and then pour it into a
mould and sculpt something else out of it!” Ok, so everyone's mind wanders. Then why aren't we all creative geniuses? Well, our biology may play a part too: In
one study, families who collectively scored higher on musical aptitude and creativity
tests were more likely to have an extra copy of “the glucose mu-ta-ro-taze gene”. The gene is involved in the release of serotonin,
a neurotransmitter that promotes neural connections. The extra copy increases the production of
serotonin and the brain’s ability to reuse it. Researchers have also found that personality
traits such as risk taking and openness to experience contribute to creativity as an
individual ability. But creativity can also likely be trained,
honed, or taught. In separate studies, professional dancers,
artists, and musicians were all compared against novices in their fields. During active or mental improvisational sessions
where participants were asked to compose a 5-note tune, mentally compose a drawing, or
mentally perform a dance, those who were professionally creative actually thought about the task differently,
engaging different areas of their brains than the novices. And then, there’s a point where nature and
nurture meet (which kinda happens all the time!). In The Genetics of Creativity, Barbot, Tan
and Grigorenko write, “it is important to see creativity not only as an individual ability,
but also as a cultural and time-specific phenomenon that is biologically grounded and has a social
purpose” They suggest that cultural factors, like the reception of creative works, influences
our biological factors, like how willing we are to take risks. And the two have a dynamic relationship. Still, while some people may have small biological
advantages to be more creative, anyone can be creative. You just need to nurture your creativity. Practice your craft, try approaching a problems
in unique ways, and let your mind wander. So, What could you do with this brick? “I love that neither of us have said anything
that has to do with actually building LEGOs” “Yeah! Maybe you could connect it to another LEGO
brick and then make something that way” You didn’t say we had many bricks! You just said we had A brick... I know! Minimalist LEGO sculptures. Just one brick.”

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of creativity and asks which group of professionals was historically not considered creative. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, are related to the topic of clothing sizes and do not match the ground truth MCQ in any way.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that Question 6 is the most similar in terms of format, but it's still not similar in terms of content or intent.

**Transcript**:
So I need you to answer a question – you
only have five seconds to respond and you can have as many answers as you like… Ready? How many uses can you think of for this brick? This is an alternative uses test, they’re
used to measure creative thinking and how flexible people are in approaching a task. Here’s one of the tests I prepared earlier… “Yeah, you could um, you could make very
interesting cookie patterns, I guess?” “You could use it as you would a domino
in a rube goldberg machine” “You could put it in a tin can and make
a rattle out of it” Where creativity comes from has mystified
us for centuries. Throughout history, we believed that creativity
was rare and seen in a small elite: professional painters, poets, performers, and musicians. For a long time, creativity was an enigma,
beyond the reach of science. But today, we know that it takes creativity
to solve problems, it’s an aspect of human intelligence. We find creativity in architecture, science,
engineering and even in nature. Creativity is everywhere! And in the past few decades, there have been
dozens of studies exploring it using brain imaging technology. We’ve found you don’t just use the left
or right hemisphere of your brain when you’re thinking creatively. There isn’t one single brain area or circuit
for creativity – professional artists suffering from damage to different brain regions continue
to produce art showing similar creativity. Over forty different areas of the brain are
likely involved with creativity. I could list them all for you, but your mind
might start to wander... Which might be a good thing! Humans spend an average of 30% of our day
engaged in "mind-wandering." A lot of these studies say that mind wandering
helps get our creativity flowing. But… why? How can we not pay attention and manage to
hit on an idea that’s just right? Some scientists think that mind-wandering
might distract you from your perceived obstacles or it may allow your subconscious to keep
working on the problem without your higher cognitive functions getting involved. Mind wandering may also promote your brain's
ability to restructure the way you look at a problem, perhaps you’ll make connections
between two seemingly unrelated things and come up with novel, creative solutions. “Oh! You could melt it and then pour it into a
mould and sculpt something else out of it!” Ok, so everyone's mind wanders. Then why aren't we all creative geniuses? Well, our biology may play a part too: In
one study, families who collectively scored higher on musical aptitude and creativity
tests were more likely to have an extra copy of “the glucose mu-ta-ro-taze gene”. The gene is involved in the release of serotonin,
a neurotransmitter that promotes neural connections. The extra copy increases the production of
serotonin and the brain’s ability to reuse it. Researchers have also found that personality
traits such as risk taking and openness to experience contribute to creativity as an
individual ability. But creativity can also likely be trained,
honed, or taught. In separate studies, professional dancers,
artists, and musicians were all compared against novices in their fields. During active or mental improvisational sessions
where participants were asked to compose a 5-note tune, mentally compose a drawing, or
mentally perform a dance, those who were professionally creative actually thought about the task differently,
engaging different areas of their brains than the novices. And then, there’s a point where nature and
nurture meet (which kinda happens all the time!). In The Genetics of Creativity, Barbot, Tan
and Grigorenko write, “it is important to see creativity not only as an individual ability,
but also as a cultural and time-specific phenomenon that is biologically grounded and has a social
purpose” They suggest that cultural factors, like the reception of creative works, influences
our biological factors, like how willing we are to take risks. And the two have a dynamic relationship. Still, while some people may have small biological
advantages to be more creative, anyone can be creative. You just need to nurture your creativity. Practice your craft, try approaching a problems
in unique ways, and let your mind wander. So, What could you do with this brick? “I love that neither of us have said anything
that has to do with actually building LEGOs” “Yeah! Maybe you could connect it to another LEGO
brick and then make something that way” You didn’t say we had many bricks! You just said we had A brick... I know! Minimalist LEGO sculptures. Just one brick.”

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the meaning of the word "enigma" in the context of the video, while the generated MCQs are about a completely different topic, which is clothing sizes and the fashion industry.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the question format and style, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match. This question is asking about the main issue with the sizing system, and it has a similar format to the ground truth MCQ, with a question and multiple options.

Look at this note. It's from the Blue
Book Modeling Agency in 1945. It says Norma Jean, who you might also know as Marilyn Monroe, was in fact, a size 12. LYNN BOORADY: She was. but back in the 50s, a size 12 was very thin. That was a model. You know, a size 12 then would be about a size 6 now. Well, to be exact, she would be a size 8 at
Topshop, 6 at Zara, and 4 to 6 at American Apparel. ..to actually show you the inconsistencies,
I went shopping. I bought 3 jeans at 3 different stores, all
in the same size. We’re already off to a bad start. These all look different. This is not a 4. This one is the one in the middle. This one fits! Hold up. It won’t zip. I give up. Let’s wind back a little bit. It was the Napoleonic wars and later
the Civil War in the US that demanded a sizing system for the mass production of clothing for the first time. It was for men’s uniforms. After that, men’s suit sizes were based
on the chest measurement and the rest was calculated accordingly, assuming that their bodies were in proportion. The demands for mass production of uniforms escalated and ready-made clothing became really popular. By the end of the nineteenth century, most
people were wearing ready-made clothes. In 1939, the US government funded statisticians
to collect the weight and 58 measurements of 15,000 women. LYNN BOORADY: They only used white women, even
though they took measurements of women of color, they didn’t include them in the study
or the calculations. The women who would’ve turned out for these studies were the poor women because they would be paid. So the data set even back then was possibly malnourished women, certainly poor women, and not very diverse group of women… and that’s what
we started with. They were looking for key measurements that
could predict the sizes of other parts of the body, the way chest sizes had for men. But women’s bodies, with variable breast
and hip sizes, were much harder to summarize with a single number. So, the data was used to create a
system in 1958 with sizes from 8 to 42, an arbitrary number based on bust size, combined
with a letter for height and a plus or minus for hips. The sizing chart was really unpopular, so
they made some updates, but finally in 1983 it was completely withdrawn. In the 1970s and 80s, companies started labeling the sizes down, and adding lower numbers like
2, zero and now even double zero. So the waist measurement that used to be a
size 12 became an 8. LYNN BOORADY: Vanity sizing specifically, is when the size on the label is lowered artificially, in order to tempt to get somebody to buy
the garment. So you’re appealing to the person’s vanity. Sizing has become a marketing tool. LYNN BOORADY: I think it’s done because the women are getting bigger,
we’re just addressing that. When the first standardizing chart came out
in 1958 it was mostly built out of malnourished, white women. Now, that there’s such a wide group of people
to cover, the retailers are picking a certain group of people to sell to, honing in what
works with that group and what doesn’t. LYNN BOORADY: I think we’re more aiming for our own target markets. So, when Abercrombie & Fitch does their sizing,
they’re sizing to their target market not to me. We kept tweaking that information
until we sold more garments and could lower the return rate. That means, even brands owned by the same company will have inconsistent sizes. A size 8 at Banana Republic will have the
same hip size as a size 2 at the Gap. So if you get frustrated while shopping…. LYNN BOORADY: It’s not you, it’s the industry, it’s not women’s bodies, we’re fine the way we are. They are just random numbers, they don’t
mean anything. And if you don’t like your size just cut
it out of your clothes.

to cover, the retailers are picking a certain group of people to sell to, honing in what
works with that group and what doesn’t. LYNN BOORADY: I think we’re more aiming for our own target markets. So, when Abercrombie & Fitch does their sizing,
they’re sizing to their target market not to me. We kept tweaking that information
until we sold more garments and could lower the return rate. That means, even brands owned by the same company will have inconsistent sizes. A size 8 at Banana Republic will have the
same hip size as a size 2 at the Gap. So if you get frustrated while shopping…. LYNN BOORADY: It’s not you, it’s the industry, it’s not women’s bodies, we’re fine the way we are. They are just random numbers, they don’t
mean anything. And if you don’t like your size just cut
it out of your clothes.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a method to identify a similar question.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific hurricane that flooded New Orleans in 2005. None of the generated MCQs are related to hurricanes or natural disasters. They seem to be related to vaccines and diseases.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is remotely related to the topic of natural disasters, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that the transcript provided does mention hurricanes, such as Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike, which could be used to generate MCQs that are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

In this case, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are specific to the topic of hurricanes and natural disasters, and then trying to find a match. 

However, if I really had to choose from the given options, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is:

None

This is because none of the generated MCQs are related to hurricanes or natural disasters, and therefore, none of them match the ground truth MCQ.

Thank you to Gates Notes for supporting PBS. Hey smart people, Joe here. 
This is 500 mousetraps and   500 ping pong balls. And this is a Slow-Mo Guy. Hello! Today, we are going to set all of these off. But why, Joe? Because it's gonna look awesome. And to show you why vaccines 
work, not just by protecting you,   but also how they can protect a whole 
population. And I'm gonna do that, with this. [dramatic music] [music] I got a flu shot this year. That 
means I’m essentially immune to   this particular strain of the flu virus. My 
immune system is like “I’ve seen you before,   you’re not welcome here” and I'll never really 
get sick with this particular strain of the flu. Wow. I've got a lot of work to do. That’s one goal of vaccines—to protect 
individuals from getting sick—and   they do that really well. But there’s an even 
bigger goal that most people don’t think about:   Getting enough people in a population 
immune to a disease so that the whole   group ends up protected, even people who didn’t 
get the vaccine. How does that work exactly? It’s a concept called herd immunity. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, 
the term “herd immunity” has been all over   the news. Herd immunity is an idea that goes 
back at least 100 years. From what we know,   veterinarians coined the term in the early 
20th century when talking about protecting   actual herds from disease. Later, scientists 
started applying the idea to human diseases. When people talk about herd immunity today, 
what they really mean is an idea scientists call   “herd threshold”: In other words, “we need some 
key percentage of the population immune to a germ   to stop disease transmission.” And that 
threshold is different for every germ. Let’s say a germ lands here, and 
none of these people are immune. And suppose one person can give 
that germ to 4 others on average. That germ has a basic reproduction number of 
4, which we write as an R with a little sub   “zero”. And you can see that this 
infection gets out of control really fast And we can show how infections 
spread on a larger scale   using a thousand mousetraps and ping pong balls. At least that's what we though we'd 
have. But it turned out that setting   up 1000 mousetraps and ping pong balls 
turned out to be kind of impossible. So I was going to the bathroom, and I 
heard the worst sound I've ever heard in   my life. 500 mousetraps being triggered 
before we were done setting them up. "Round 2, fight" [mousetraps going off] "why are we still here, just to suffer?" This is the third time we've done 
this, I'm not going to explain why. Ok, so after some minor adjustments 
and recalculations we can NOW   show how infections spread on a larger scale 
using 500 mousetraps. And since this whole   thing takes like 2 seconds to happen, we brought 
in Gavin from the Slow-Mo Guys to shoot in super   slow-motion at 1000 frames per second. Plus 
he knows a thing or two about mousetraps. 3… 2… 1…
[dramatic mousetrap noises] I think it worked! Oh boy Gah! Ok, so we shot that in 4k at 1000 frames per 
second. It was quite a slow start, wasn't it? It was! I thought it wasn't gonna work! That one sent into the middle. Wow, that's amazing. This is exactly how a pandemic works. It's like you've got 2 outbreaks at the moment. Oh there they go. Yeah, here it goes. Amazing. Haha, look at you in the background. I don't want to get a mousetrap to the 
eye. I'm not sure we're insured for that.   This is currently where we are in the pandemic. I think that one's me there, hiding at home. This shows it perfectly. Exactly 
how fast a pandemic can break out.   It took a little longer in real 
life than 3 seconds, but it got bad! [mousetrap noises] I'd say that worked. Except if this was a 
pandemic, I guess that's not a good thing. Great demonstration, though! And this 
guy is happy as Larry. He's still fine. He's good. Way to stay home, bud. So how do we keep a pandemic from 
growing? By giving people immunity   without them getting sick. How do you do 
that? Vaccines! That's what vaccines are for. Oh that's the one, yeah. Let’s go back to this example. To keep 
the number of infected people from growing   you need each sick person to give the germ 
to 1 or fewer people. That would mean if   an infected person sneezes on four people, 
at least three of those people are immune. The germ has a low probability of ever 
encountering someone it can infect, so eventually   the whole group ends up protected. Now let's see 
this version in action, but with our mouse traps… So now all of these white balls 
are sat on inactive mousetraps. That's right, those basically represent 
people who have gotten the vaccine.   So they can't explode their coronavirus 
all over the rest of the table.   And hopefully when we throw this in there it'll 
look a little bit different than the last one. 3… 2… 1… [mousetrap noises] Interestingly, we still had a couple of 
little hotspots. But the herd was immune. Playing back now. We get a couple there. That's like a bad family party. See, that one landed on all the white balls. And we get maybe one more. Those are 
like a buffer for all the other ones. That makes sense, because vaccines might not work 
100% of the time, but they can protect the entire   population. Even though this is a lot 
less interesting than the first version. Yeah, the more boring this footage gets, the 
better we're proving the point about vaccines. Right, and maybe the more boring this 
footage gets, the more normal life can be. I miss boring. I miss boring too. As you just saw, it’s clear that by immunizing 
enough people (or mouse traps), we stopped the   chain reaction of infection, and we protected the 
whole population. But I wanna dig a little deeper,   because the science gets really interesting, and 
I know you guys like to nerd out as much as I do. To reach “herd immunity” in the mouse trap 
example, our threshold was this. But different   germs have different herd immunity thresholds, 
depending on how contagious they are. For, say,   measles… it’s super contagious. One infected 
person can infect 12 to 18 other people.   So you need 94% of the “herd” immune to stop 
the spread. Polio is 7, so the threshold is   85% immune. These thresholds are where we 
get our goals for mass vaccination programs. There’s a pretty simple bit of math to 
figure out the minimum proportion of a   population that has to be immunized to stop 
an infection with a given reproduction number.   Graphed out, it looks like this So what’s the R0 for the 
virus that causes COVID-19?   This is one thing that scientists are 
still trying to figure out for certain,   but it’s likely somewhere in here . That means 
to keep infections from growing, this percentage   of the population needs to be immune. And if 
the virus mutates to become more contagious,   you can see that the percent of the population 
that’s immune would need to be even higher.   The fastest, safest way to reach that 
level of immunity is with vaccines. Vaccines currently prevent 2 to 3 million 
deaths every year from diseases like   diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
influenza and measles. They are   basically the best public health 
tool since toilets and clean water. Does everyone who gets the vaccine become 
immune? No, but an effective vaccine works in   most people. For instance, the measles 
vaccine? That works in about 97% of people. For the COVID-19 vaccines, the data tells us they 
protect more than 90% of people who get the the   shot, or shots, since many of them work best with 
two doses. And that 90-plus percent is good news,   because it’s almost impossible to make sure 
absolutely every person gets a vaccine. Say 60 percent of people get a vaccine that’s 
effective 90% of the time. That’s only 54% percent   effective protection, which is below the 
threshold our math tells us we need for COVID.   But for a vaccine that’s 90% effective, if 75% 
of people get it, we’re above the threshold. In the end the important thing is 
to get enough people vaccinated   based on how effective a given vaccine is. In the real world, disease outbreaks 
are a bit more complicated than mouse   traps or simple graphs, but this model 
explains what health officials try to do: We have a group of susceptible people 
here. Some of them get infected   and go here. And from there they 
either recover, here, or they die. To control a germ, the goal 
is to get enough people here   and fewer people here so the germ has 
no susceptible people left to infect. Some people argue we should get people 
into the immune bucket by just letting   them get infected and then recover. Like a 
big global chickenpox party for COVID-19. But without a vaccine, if the only pathway 
to this recovered group is to get infected,   that means some number of 
people are going to end up here   (dead). What a vaccine does is lets you jump 
straight from here to here and avoid here. And if we have a choice that lets us 
avoid death, why wouldn’t we take it? We know this has worked before, with diseases like 
measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and polio.   They usually flare up in cycles. Because as 
more people got infected and recovered the   disease would slow down. Until new babies 
were born, letting the virus find a new   susceptible population, and a new outbreak 
would happen. Vaccines helped disrupt these   cycles by keeping the susceptible population 
low for longer periods of time. In some cases,   vaccines can disrupt the cycles so much that 
they can completely eradicate the germs from the   planet - this has happened twice - one time with a 
human disease - smallpox, and another time with an   animal disease - rinderpest. And there are efforts 
ongoing now to use vaccines to eradicate polio. In fact, vaccines work so well, 
they have a funny way of fooling   people into thinking they don’t need them anymore. Over the past several years, measles 
vaccination rates have stalled out around 85%.   That’s 10% less than we need to keep outbreaks of 
this super infectious disease at bay. And we’re   starting to see the effects. Last year, a 
whopping 870,000 measles cases were reported.   And measles deaths hit a 23-year high. And 
at least half of the countries that suspended   measles vaccination campaigns because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic have reported new outbreaks. The point is we have to stay vigilant. Vaccines 
are critical to ending a pandemic like COVID-19,   but it won’t happen overnight. A raging 
forest fire doesn't stop the moment people   start spraying water on it, and neither does a 
pandemic just because a vaccine is available. In today’s society, one infected person 
can move across the world to a susceptible   community really quickly… and one little 
spark has the potential to start a new fire. And one of the biggest challenges facing public 
health officials is making sure different   communities and different parts of the world 
have access to vaccines. Making enough of them,   making them affordable, and making sure 
people understand why they’re important. That gets us back to that surprising reason 
vaccines are important. Vaccines aren’t just   for you. They’re for you AND everyone else. 
When vaccines for these germs first came out,   infections also went down in older populations 
that didn’t actually get immunized. We know   this works, and it can work again with everyone’s 
help. Every vaccine that’s given has the potential   to protect more than one person, and that’s a 
beautiful way to end a disease if you ask me. One more thing: It’s important to remember that   how bad a germ is has a lot to do with us. 
Diseases aren’t just something that happens to us,   their infectiveness isn’t set in stone, and our 
behavior can play a big part in keeping us safe. Things like masks, social distancing, 
hygiene, they still matter alongside vaccines. And that looks like this. What are you doing? I wanted to put us in there, so 
I'm just drawing. This is you. My head's not nearly that round. I also couldn't remember what the nose and 
mouth look like. So I just drew the mask. There are no noses and mouths. Let's do this. [dramatic music]
[absolutely nothing happening] It might be the worst thing I've ever shot. This 
is 5000 pictures of basically nothing happening. I would kill for that right now. I 
guess this would be a good time to   remind everybody to go subscribe to Slow-Mo Guys. Thanks, yeah if you're not busy. Vaccines are the greatest boring thing ever. Maybe something happened and we just didn't 
see it with our human eyes. Nope, nothing. Maybe you should just delete this. It's a 64 gb file. Wow, all those 1s and 0s wasted. Vaccines combined with the right 
behavior are a superpowered combination. Let's go home, me! Stay curious. We want to say thank you to

**Transcript**:
Thank you to Gates Notes for supporting PBS. Hey smart people, Joe here. 
This is 500 mousetraps and   500 ping pong balls. And this is a Slow-Mo Guy. Hello! Today, we are going to set all of these off. But why, Joe? Because it's gonna look awesome. And to show you why vaccines 
work, not just by protecting you,   but also how they can protect a whole 
population. And I'm gonna do that, with this. [dramatic music] [music] I got a flu shot this year. That 
means I’m essentially immune to   this particular strain of the flu virus. My 
immune system is like “I’ve seen you before,   you’re not welcome here” and I'll never really 
get sick with this particular strain of the flu. Wow. I've got a lot of work to do. That’s one goal of vaccines—to protect 
individuals from getting sick—and   they do that really well. But there’s an even 
bigger goal that most people don’t think about:   Getting enough people in a population 
immune to a disease so that the whole   group ends up protected, even people who didn’t 
get the vaccine. How does that work exactly? It’s a concept called herd immunity. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, 
the term “herd immunity” has been all over   the news. Herd immunity is an idea that goes 
back at least 100 years. From what we know,   veterinarians coined the term in the early 
20th century when talking about protecting   actual herds from disease. Later, scientists 
started applying the idea to human diseases. When people talk about herd immunity today, 
what they really mean is an idea scientists call   “herd threshold”: In other words, “we need some 
key percentage of the population immune to a germ   to stop disease transmission.” And that 
threshold is different for every germ. Let’s say a germ lands here, and 
none of these people are immune. And suppose one person can give 
that germ to 4 others on average. That germ has a basic reproduction number of 
4, which we write as an R with a little sub   “zero”. And you can see that this 
infection gets out of control really fast And we can show how infections 
spread on a larger scale   using a thousand mousetraps and ping pong balls. At least that's what we though we'd 
have. But it turned out that setting   up 1000 mousetraps and ping pong balls 
turned out to be kind of impossible. So I was going to the bathroom, and I 
heard the worst sound I've ever heard in   my life. 500 mousetraps being triggered 
before we were done setting them up. "Round 2, fight" [mousetraps going off] "why are we still here, just to suffer?" This is the third time we've done 
this, I'm not going to explain why. Ok, so after some minor adjustments 
and recalculations we can NOW   show how infections spread on a larger scale 
using 500 mousetraps. And since this whole   thing takes like 2 seconds to happen, we brought 
in Gavin from the Slow-Mo Guys to shoot in super   slow-motion at 1000 frames per second. Plus 
he knows a thing or two about mousetraps. 3… 2… 1…
[dramatic mousetrap noises] I think it worked! Oh boy Gah! Ok, so we shot that in 4k at 1000 frames per 
second. It was quite a slow start, wasn't it? It was! I thought it wasn't gonna work! That one sent into the middle. Wow, that's amazing. This is exactly how a pandemic works. It's like you've got 2 outbreaks at the moment. Oh there they go. Yeah, here it goes. Amazing. Haha, look at you in the background. I don't want to get a mousetrap to the 
eye. I'm not sure we're insured for that.   This is currently where we are in the pandemic. I think that one's me there, hiding at home. This shows it perfectly. Exactly 
how fast a pandemic can break out.   It took a little longer in real 
life than 3 seconds, but it got bad! [mousetrap noises] I'd say that worked. Except if this was a 
pandemic, I guess that's not a good thing. Great demonstration, though! And this 
guy is happy as Larry. He's still fine. He's good. Way to stay home, bud. So how do we keep a pandemic from 
growing? By giving people immunity   without them getting sick. How do you do 
that? Vaccines! That's what vaccines are for. Oh that's the one, yeah. Let’s go back to this example. To keep 
the number of infected people from growing   you need each sick person to give the germ 
to 1 or fewer people. That would mean if   an infected person sneezes on four people, 
at least three of those people are immune. The germ has a low probability of ever 
encountering someone it can infect, so eventually   the whole group ends up protected. Now let's see 
this version in action, but with our mouse traps… So now all of these white balls 
are sat on inactive mousetraps. That's right, those basically represent 
people who have gotten the vaccine.   So they can't explode their coronavirus 
all over the rest of the table.   And hopefully when we throw this in there it'll 
look a little bit different than the last one. 3… 2… 1… [mousetrap noises] Interestingly, we still had a couple of 
little hotspots. But the herd was immune. Playing back now. We get a couple there. That's like a bad family party. See, that one landed on all the white balls. And we get maybe one more. Those are 
like a buffer for all the other ones. That makes sense, because vaccines might not work 
100% of the time, but they can protect the entire   population. Even though this is a lot 
less interesting than the first version. Yeah, the more boring this footage gets, the 
better we're proving the point about vaccines. Right, and maybe the more boring this 
footage gets, the more normal life can be. I miss boring. I miss boring too. As you just saw, it’s clear that by immunizing 
enough people (or mouse traps), we stopped the   chain reaction of infection, and we protected the 
whole population. But I wanna dig a little deeper,   because the science gets really interesting, and 
I know you guys like to nerd out as much as I do. To reach “herd immunity” in the mouse trap 
example, our threshold was this. But different   germs have different herd immunity thresholds, 
depending on how contagious they are. For, say,   measles… it’s super contagious. One infected 
person can infect 12 to 18 other people.   So you need 94% of the “herd” immune to stop 
the spread. Polio is 7, so the threshold is   85% immune. These thresholds are where we 
get our goals for mass vaccination programs. There’s a pretty simple bit of math to 
figure out the minimum proportion of a   population that has to be immunized to stop 
an infection with a given reproduction number.   Graphed out, it looks like this So what’s the R0 for the 
virus that causes COVID-19?   This is one thing that scientists are 
still trying to figure out for certain,   but it’s likely somewhere in here . That means 
to keep infections from growing, this percentage   of the population needs to be immune. And if 
the virus mutates to become more contagious,   you can see that the percent of the population 
that’s immune would need to be even higher.   The fastest, safest way to reach that 
level of immunity is with vaccines. Vaccines currently prevent 2 to 3 million 
deaths every year from diseases like   diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
influenza and measles. They are   basically the best public health 
tool since toilets and clean water. Does everyone who gets the vaccine become 
immune? No, but an effective vaccine works in   most people. For instance, the measles 
vaccine? That works in about 97% of people. For the COVID-19 vaccines, the data tells us they 
protect more than 90% of people who get the the   shot, or shots, since many of them work best with 
two doses. And that 90-plus percent is good news,   because it’s almost impossible to make sure 
absolutely every person gets a vaccine. Say 60 percent of people get a vaccine that’s 
effective 90% of the time. That’s only 54% percent   effective protection, which is below the 
threshold our math tells us we need for COVID.   But for a vaccine that’s 90% effective, if 75% 
of people get it, we’re above the threshold. In the end the important thing is 
to get enough people vaccinated   based on how effective a given vaccine is. In the real world, disease outbreaks 
are a bit more complicated than mouse   traps or simple graphs, but this model 
explains what health officials try to do: We have a group of susceptible people 
here. Some of them get infected   and go here. And from there they 
either recover, here, or they die. To control a germ, the goal 
is to get enough people here   and fewer people here so the germ has 
no susceptible people left to infect. Some people argue we should get people 
into the immune bucket by just letting   them get infected and then recover. Like a 
big global chickenpox party for COVID-19. But without a vaccine, if the only pathway 
to this recovered group is to get infected,   that means some number of 
people are going to end up here   (dead). What a vaccine does is lets you jump

like a buffer for all the other ones. That makes sense, because vaccines might not work 
100% of the time, but they can protect the entire   population. Even though this is a lot 
less interesting than the first version. Yeah, the more boring this footage gets, the 
better we're proving the point about vaccines. Right, and maybe the more boring this 
footage gets, the more normal life can be. I miss boring. I miss boring too. As you just saw, it’s clear that by immunizing 
enough people (or mouse traps), we stopped the   chain reaction of infection, and we protected the 
whole population. But I wanna dig a little deeper,   because the science gets really interesting, and 
I know you guys like to nerd out as much as I do. To reach “herd immunity” in the mouse trap 
example, our threshold was this. But different   germs have different herd immunity thresholds, 
depending on how contagious they are. For, say,   measles… it’s super contagious. One infected 
person can infect 12 to 18 other people.   So you need 94% of the “herd” immune to stop 
the spread. Polio is 7, so the threshold is   85% immune. These thresholds are where we 
get our goals for mass vaccination programs. There’s a pretty simple bit of math to 
figure out the minimum proportion of a   population that has to be immunized to stop 
an infection with a given reproduction number.   Graphed out, it looks like this So what’s the R0 for the 
virus that causes COVID-19?   This is one thing that scientists are 
still trying to figure out for certain,   but it’s likely somewhere in here . That means 
to keep infections from growing, this percentage   of the population needs to be immune. And if 
the virus mutates to become more contagious,   you can see that the percent of the population 
that’s immune would need to be even higher.   The fastest, safest way to reach that 
level of immunity is with vaccines. Vaccines currently prevent 2 to 3 million 
deaths every year from diseases like   diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
influenza and measles. They are   basically the best public health 
tool since toilets and clean water. Does everyone who gets the vaccine become 
immune? No, but an effective vaccine works in   most people. For instance, the measles 
vaccine? That works in about 97% of people. For the COVID-19 vaccines, the data tells us they 
protect more than 90% of people who get the the   shot, or shots, since many of them work best with 
two doses. And that 90-plus percent is good news,   because it’s almost impossible to make sure 
absolutely every person gets a vaccine. Say 60 percent of people get a vaccine that’s 
effective 90% of the time. That’s only 54% percent   effective protection, which is below the 
threshold our math tells us we need for COVID.   But for a vaccine that’s 90% effective, if 75% 
of people get it, we’re above the threshold. In the end the important thing is 
to get enough people vaccinated   based on how effective a given vaccine is. In the real world, disease outbreaks 
are a bit more complicated than mouse   traps or simple graphs, but this model 
explains what health officials try to do: We have a group of susceptible people 
here. Some of them get infected   and go here. And from there they 
either recover, here, or they die. To control a germ, the goal 
is to get enough people here   and fewer people here so the germ has 
no susceptible people left to infect. Some people argue we should get people 
into the immune bucket by just letting   them get infected and then recover. Like a 
big global chickenpox party for COVID-19. But without a vaccine, if the only pathway 
to this recovered group is to get infected,   that means some number of 
people are going to end up here   (dead). What a vaccine does is lets you jump 
straight from here to here and avoid here. And if we have a choice that lets us 
avoid death, why wouldn’t we take it? We know this has worked before, with diseases like 
measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and polio.   They usually flare up in cycles. Because as 
more people got infected and recovered the   disease would slow down. Until new babies 
were born, letting the virus find a new   susceptible population, and a new outbreak 
would happen. Vaccines helped disrupt these   cycles by keeping the susceptible population 
low for longer periods of time. In some cases,   vaccines can disrupt the cycles so much that 
they can completely eradicate the germs from the   planet - this has happened twice - one time with a 
human disease - smallpox, and another time with an   animal disease - rinderpest. And there are efforts 
ongoing now to use vaccines to eradicate polio. In fact, vaccines work so well, 
they have a funny way of fooling   people into thinking they don’t need them anymore. Over the past several years, measles 
vaccination rates have stalled out around 85%.   That’s 10% less than we need to keep outbreaks of 
this super infectious disease at bay. And we’re   starting to see the effects. Last year, a 
whopping 870,000 measles cases were reported.   And measles deaths hit a 23-year high. And 
at least half of the countries that suspended   measles vaccination campaigns because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic have reported new outbreaks. The point is we have to stay vigilant. Vaccines 
are critical to ending a pandemic like COVID-19,   but it won’t happen overnight. A raging 
forest fire doesn't stop the moment people   start spraying water on it, and neither does a 
pandemic just because a vaccine is available. In today’s society, one infected person 
can move across the world to a susceptible   community really quickly… and one little 
spark has the potential to start a new fire. And one of the biggest challenges facing public 
health officials is making sure different   communities and different parts of the world 
have access to vaccines. Making enough of them,   making them affordable, and making sure 
people understand why they’re important. That gets us back to that surprising reason 
vaccines are important. Vaccines aren’t just   for you. They’re for you AND everyone else. 
When vaccines for these germs first came out,   infections also went down in older populations 
that didn’t actually get immunized. We know   this works, and it can work again with everyone’s 
help. Every vaccine that’s given has the potential   to protect more than one person, and that’s a 
beautiful way to end a disease if you ask me. One more thing: It’s important to remember that   how bad a germ is has a lot to do with us. 
Diseases aren’t just something that happens to us,   their infectiveness isn’t set in stone, and our 
behavior can play a big part in keeping us safe. Things like masks, social distancing, 
hygiene, they still matter alongside vaccines. And that looks like this. What are you doing? I wanted to put us in there, so 
I'm just drawing. This is you. My head's not nearly that round. I also couldn't remember what the nose and 
mouth look like. So I just drew the mask. There are no noses and mouths. Let's do this. [dramatic music]
[absolutely nothing happening] It might be the worst thing I've ever shot. This 
is 5000 pictures of basically nothing happening. I would kill for that right now. I 
guess this would be a good time to   remind everybody to go subscribe to Slow-Mo Guys. Thanks, yeah if you're not busy. Vaccines are the greatest boring thing ever. Maybe something happened and we just didn't 
see it with our human eyes. Nope, nothing. Maybe you should just delete this. It's a 64 gb file. Wow, all those 1s and 0s wasted. Vaccines combined with the right 
behavior are a superpowered combination. Let's go home, me! Stay curious. We want to say thank you to 
Gates Notes for supporting PBS.   If you want to learn more about vaccines,

**Transcript**:
the big short is probably one of the most popular films on the topic of investing it's a star-studded movie that follows the real story of three groups of people who short or bet against the housing market for billions of dollars right before the 2008 real estate crisis as you might expect our heroes end up making quite a bit of money but how exactly does a short work well in the movie the positions are taken through what are known as swaps a derivative agreement that is taken with the banks but for common investors short positions typically involve individual stocks make them easy enough to take but be warned shorting comes with a lot of risks on top of charging you expenses you don't normally see with standard investing shorting also offers a skewed payoff where you face a limited upside in an uncapped downside meaning you could lose an infinite amount of money theoretically anyway so before you decide to short something let's go over the strategy in the risks involved on today's plain bagel [Music] shorting also known as short selling is a trading strategy where an investor sells a security today and buys it back in the future hoping that the price of the security will go down it's effectively the opposite approach to a traditional long position where investors buy today and sell at some point in the future to cash in hopefully after the price has gone up it follows the same buy low sell high mentality as long investing but it just reverses the order of the motto so investors sell high today and hope that the price will go down so they can buy low in the future now shortening on a stock is a bit more complicated than going long on a position so let's go through a running example to explain how the strategy works in the risks it poses imagine you have to investors who decide to take opposite positions in plain bagel Co the company stock currently has a market price of $10 investor a decides to buy 1,000 of these stocks thereby investing $10,000 one investor B decides to short 1,000 stocks thereby selling 10,000 dollars worth of the investment now I know what you're thinking how the hell do you sell a stock that you don't own well oftentimes the process involves selling a borrowed security for example in a brokerage account you can often sell a position by borrowing a stock from your broker and then shorting that way leaving you with the proceeds from the sale the money you make from the sale obviously doesn't really belong to you since you sold someone else's stock to get it but eventually when you buy the security back known as covering your short you'll be able to return the stock and keep whatever money is left over which is how you profit from the trade so going back to our example the stock price falls from $10 to $5 investor a will lose $5,000 one investor B will gain $5,000 since they'll be able to buy the stock back for a lower price and keep the remaining sales proceeds on the other side of things if the stock price increases from ten to fifteen dollars investor aid will be up five thousand dollars while investor B will be down five thousand but this raises an interesting question up until this point investor B hasn't actually contributed any of their own money so how is he going to buy back the stock for more money than what's in the account well this is where the concept of margins come into play you see too short a position an investor needs to post what's known as an initial margin a 50% into their account to act as a buffer should the investment lose value this means that investor B would have contributed five thousand dollars of his own funds at the beginning of our example to accommodate for any losses the amount still belongs to the investor but it's held as collateral by the broker to ensure that investor B can afford to buy back the share in the future investor B will also be responsible for what are known as margin calls a process that occurs when the margin becomes insufficient for example in the event that the share price rises to $15 investor B would receive a margin call to replenish their cash buffer based on what's known as the maintenance margin since there's no more wiggle room in the account to accommodate for further losses so a big difference between shorting and going long a position is that you can only short in a margin account while this has its downsides it does add leverage to the investors return what do I mean by that well let's go back to our example let's say that our share price falls from 10 to 5 dollars this would leave investor aid to lose $5,000 an investor be to gain $5,000 on an absolute basis these returns equate one another but on a percentage basis taking into account margins they're actually quite different you see investor a has lost roughly 50% of their investment but since investor B has only contributed five thousand dollars of his own money to this margin account he's actually gained 100 percent of his investment doubled the percentage of investor a because borrowing is involved with shorting investor B will see his returns amplified though this goes both ways percentage losses in the short position will be double what they might have been for investor a so will decline a 50% for investor a would translate into a one hundred percent decline for investor B so short positions not only flip the percentage return received by investors but they also amplify them both on the way up and the way down but here's where we get into the distinct disadvantages of a short position namely short positions come with unique costs that a standard long investor won't face for example if the stock you borrow pays a dividend you'll actually need to pay this amount to your broker meaning that you'll face a cost equal to whatever dividend the stock pays short positions also charge investors in interest rate on the value of the stock you borrowed after all since you are borrowing and selling someone else's security you need to compensate them in the same way that you would compensate a bank with interest on a loan typically the rate charge on a short position can range anywhere from 2.5 to 20 percent but it can be higher for what are known as hard to borrow stocks highly volatile or small cap positions so needless to say shorting the stock can be quite a bit more expensive than a simple buy but for the most part these expenses are fair the interest makes sense since you are taking a leveraged position and since you are trying to inverse the return of a long position it's only natural that you pay out the dividend received from the stock but there are some absolute disadvantages involved with the short strategy some of which may very well turn you off the idea of ever trying to short a stock for one short strategies face what's known as buy-in risk the chance that a broker will make you prematurely cover your position this can occur for a number of reasons a broker may need to return a stock to the portfolio they took it from or the stock may simply see a surge in demand but the end result is that you may be forced to close your position at any time this is a pretty significant drawback especially when it comes to waiting out market volatility in our example perhaps investor B is confident that certain factors whether it be regulation or technological change will cause the stock to crash in two years time but if the price surges in the near term they may be forced to realize a loss even if they end up being right on top of this when shorting a position you may experience what's known as a short squeeze when a heavily shorted stock sees its price surge because the investors shorting the stock need to cover their physician since investors who short sell have a appropriately shorter time horizon than long investors this is a chance that they buy back the stock around the same time which can lead to a surge in the price and make it harder for you to cover your own position without realizing a loss so as you can see there are some distinct disadvantages with shorting a position which alone may lead you to stay away but perhaps the biggest risk with short positions has to do with their skewed payoff with her to investors longing in shorting the $10.00 stock we face to risk reward profiles on the one hand investor a can theoretically earn an infinitely high return the $10,000 investment in the ten dollar stock could double triple quadruple in value as the stock price climbs to 20 30 $40 or higher on the downside the most she can lose is the money she's invested the $10,000 which would only happen if the stock fell to 0 a pretty drastic outcome now investor B actually flips the risk reward here if the stock drops down to 0 ignoring fees they can achieve a 200% return since they are able to keep the $10,000 your profits from their $5,000 investment on the other hand if the stock instead climbs to 20 30 $40 or higher they can lose 200 400 600 percent or more this means that you can lose a lot more money than what you've initially invested and indeed this very feature has had devastating impacts on the investors this is why many investors tend to stick with long lonely positions for many of the return is simply not worth the risk and on top of the fact that you're going against the natural upward bias of stocks you're more or less betting against a company that is actively trying to prove you wrong short selling certainly does play an important role in the world of investments and indeed you can make a lot of money by placing the short bet against a deteriorating stock but if you're looking to speculate with short selling tread lightly you may end up buying off a lot more than you can

short sell have a appropriately shorter time horizon than long investors this is a chance that they buy back the stock around the same time which can lead to a surge in the price and make it harder for you to cover your own position without realizing a loss so as you can see there are some distinct disadvantages with shorting a position which alone may lead you to stay away but perhaps the biggest risk with short positions has to do with their skewed payoff with her to investors longing in shorting the $10.00 stock we face to risk reward profiles on the one hand investor a can theoretically earn an infinitely high return the $10,000 investment in the ten dollar stock could double triple quadruple in value as the stock price climbs to 20 30 $40 or higher on the downside the most she can lose is the money she's invested the $10,000 which would only happen if the stock fell to 0 a pretty drastic outcome now investor B actually flips the risk reward here if the stock drops down to 0 ignoring fees they can achieve a 200% return since they are able to keep the $10,000 your profits from their $5,000 investment on the other hand if the stock instead climbs to 20 30 $40 or higher they can lose 200 400 600 percent or more this means that you can lose a lot more money than what you've initially invested and indeed this very feature has had devastating impacts on the investors this is why many investors tend to stick with long lonely positions for many of the return is simply not worth the risk and on top of the fact that you're going against the natural upward bias of stocks you're more or less betting against a company that is actively trying to prove you wrong short selling certainly does play an important role in the world of investments and indeed you

**Transcript**:
the big short is probably one of the most popular films on the topic of investing it's a star-studded movie that follows the real story of three groups of people who short or bet against the housing market for billions of dollars right before the 2008 real estate crisis as you might expect our heroes end up making quite a bit of money but how exactly does a short work well in the movie the positions are taken through what are known as swaps a derivative agreement that is taken with the banks but for common investors short positions typically involve individual stocks make them easy enough to take but be warned shorting comes with a lot of risks on top of charging you expenses you don't normally see with standard investing shorting also offers a skewed payoff where you face a limited upside in an uncapped downside meaning you could lose an infinite amount of money theoretically anyway so before you decide to short something let's go over the strategy in the risks involved on today's plain bagel [Music] shorting also known as short selling is a trading strategy where an investor sells a security today and buys it back in the future hoping that the price of the security will go down it's effectively the opposite approach to a traditional long position where investors buy today and sell at some point in the future to cash in hopefully after the price has gone up it follows the same buy low sell high mentality as long investing but it just reverses the order of the motto so investors sell high today and hope that the price will go down so they can buy low in the future now shortening on a stock is a bit more complicated than going long on a position so let's go through a running example to explain how the strategy works in the risks it poses imagine you have to investors who decide to take opposite positions in plain bagel Co the company stock currently has a market price of $10 investor a decides to buy 1,000 of these stocks thereby investing $10,000 one investor B decides to short 1,000 stocks thereby selling 10,000 dollars worth of the investment now I know what you're thinking how the hell do you sell a stock that you don't own well oftentimes the process involves selling a borrowed security for example in a brokerage account you can often sell a position by borrowing a stock from your broker and then shorting that way leaving you with the proceeds from the sale the money you make from the sale obviously doesn't really belong to you since you sold someone else's stock to get it but eventually when you buy the security back known as covering your short you'll be able to return the stock and keep whatever money is left over which is how you profit from the trade so going back to our example the stock price falls from $10 to $5 investor a will lose $5,000 one investor B will gain $5,000 since they'll be able to buy the stock back for a lower price and keep the remaining sales proceeds on the other side of things if the stock price increases from ten to fifteen dollars investor aid will be up five thousand dollars while investor B will be down five thousand but this raises an interesting question up until this point investor B hasn't actually contributed any of their own money so how is he going to buy back the stock for more money than what's in the account well this is where the concept of margins come into play you see too short a position an investor needs to post what's known as an initial margin a 50% into their account to act as a buffer should the investment lose value this means that investor B would have contributed five thousand dollars of his own funds at the beginning of our example to accommodate for any losses the amount still belongs to the investor but it's held as collateral by the broker to ensure that investor B can afford to buy back the share in the future investor B will also be responsible for what are known as margin calls a process that occurs when the margin becomes insufficient for example in the event that the share price rises to $15 investor B would receive a margin call to replenish their cash buffer based on what's known as the maintenance margin since there's no more wiggle room in the account to accommodate for further losses so a big difference between shorting and going long a position is that you can only short in a margin account while this has its downsides it does add leverage to the investors return what do I mean by that well let's go back to our example let's say that our share price falls from 10 to 5 dollars this would leave investor aid to lose $5,000 an investor be to gain $5,000 on an absolute basis these returns equate one another but on a percentage basis taking into account margins they're actually quite different you see investor a has lost roughly 50% of their investment but since investor B has only contributed five thousand dollars of his own money to this margin account he's actually gained 100 percent of his investment doubled the percentage of investor a because borrowing is involved with shorting investor B will see his returns amplified though this goes both ways percentage losses in the short position will be double what they might have been for investor a so will decline a 50% for investor a would translate into a one hundred percent decline for investor B so short positions not only flip the percentage return received by investors but they also amplify them both on the way up and the way down but here's where we get into the distinct disadvantages of a short position namely short positions come with unique costs that a standard long investor won't face for example if the stock you borrow pays a dividend you'll actually need to pay this amount to your broker meaning that you'll face a cost equal to whatever dividend the stock pays short positions also charge investors in interest rate on the value of the stock you borrowed after all since you are borrowing and selling someone else's security you need to compensate them in the same way that you would compensate a bank with interest on a loan typically the rate charge on a short position can range anywhere from 2.5 to 20 percent but it can be higher for what are known as hard to borrow stocks highly volatile or small cap positions so needless to say shorting the stock can be quite a bit more expensive than a simple buy but for the most part these expenses are fair the interest makes sense since you are taking a leveraged position and since you are trying to inverse the return of a long position it's only natural that you pay out the dividend received from the stock but there are some absolute disadvantages involved with the short strategy some of which may very well turn you off the idea of ever trying to short a stock for one short strategies face what's known as buy-in risk the chance that a broker will make you prematurely cover your position this can occur for a number of reasons a broker may need to return a stock to the portfolio they took it from or the stock may simply see a surge in demand but the end result is that you may be forced to close your position at any time this is a pretty significant drawback especially when it comes to waiting out market volatility in our example perhaps investor B is confident that certain factors whether it be regulation or technological change will cause the stock to crash in two years time but if the price surges in the near term they may be forced to realize a loss even if they end up being right on top of this when shorting a position you may experience what's known as a short squeeze when a heavily shorted stock sees its price surge because the investors shorting the stock need to cover their physician since investors who short sell have a appropriately shorter time horizon than long investors this is a chance that they buy back the stock around the same time which can lead to a surge in the price and make it harder

**Transcript**:
- Why is the sky blue? It's one of the most common questions asked by both kids and adults, unless you're from ancient Greece. I know, I know, you'd think the country that is now ubiquitously known
for beautiful blue rooftops, crystal blue waters, and a blue flag would have a longer
history with the color. But if you were to read Homer, uh, not that one, the famous ancient Greek writer
from the 8th century B.C., you'd notice that the word
blue isn't mentioned once. Through thousands of pages of
"The Iliad" and "The Odyssey," black is mentioned 170 times,
white 100, red 13 times, yellow and green each around
10, but blue never appears. What's weirder is that
Homer describes things that we would normally
call blue, like the ocean, as wine-dark. He even calls honey
green and sheep violet. For a while, some suggested that maybe the ancient Greeks just saw
colors different than we do, or maybe they were all color blind. But we now know that
color vision developed around 30 million years
ago so that's not it. It gets even crazier. As historians and researchers
began looking into other ancient civilizations,
they realized the same thing. Almost none of them used the word blue. From Icelandic texts
to ancient Indian epics dating to about four millennia ago, to ancient Chinese writings, and even the original Hebrew Bible, all of them fail to mention blue once, while all of them mention
black, white, and red, and many, the Bible included,
also mention green and yellow. Again, it's not like they
don't talk about things that we would call blue. They describe the ocean
as wide, stormy, silent, but never blue. It wasn't until the mid-1800s that linguists began to analyze
the history of languages and found something peculiar. In every culture, black
and white are first. Then the first color to enter
the language is always red. Then yellow follows, then green. And then blue is the final
color to enter language in every single culture. Over the years, researchers have found some minor exceptions
with the middle order, so green and yellow, but red is always first
and blue is always last in every single language. So, why this order? There's two main theories. First, the evolutionary
explanation is simple. Black and white help distinguish
between night and day, light and dark, and are
the most clear and useful, so every culture has those. Then red, it's often associated
with blood or danger. Even human faces and communication use red through the galvanic skin response, like when you blush or are stressed. Green and yellow entered language
as the need to distinguish between ripe and unripe foods. And blue? There's very few blue things
that we actually interact with. Blue fruits are pretty rare. Blue animals are rare too. And when they are blue,
it's often not a pigment, but a sort of light illusion,
like in butterflies. Even the modern European
language words for blue are derived from ancient
words for black or green. The second explanation suggests that these words don't enter language until humans could make them. Red being the easiest and
most accessible color, because you just take a piece of dry clay and use it as a crayon. If you think of cave, for example, there's a lot of black and red in them. But blue? It's one of the hardest colors to create. For thousands because of years, nobody had it except the Egyptians, and they had a word for it. So does this mean that
ancient people couldn't see those colors before
they had a word for it? Not exactly. Early humans would have considered colors as simply hues of black, white, or red, which sounds kind of crazy, but there's actually modern
day evidence for this. If you look at these 12 colors, can you spot the one that's different? We might think clearly it's this one, but when presented with a similar chart, the Himba people of Namibia, who don't have a separate word for blue, take longer to point out this distinction. On the contrary, when
looking at green colors, they are more quickly able
to note the difference that we wouldn't catch
as quickly, this one. And this is because they have
more words for types of green than we do in English. In fact, one of their
color categories clumps some types of blue and green together, while they have other color categories for different greens still. In the 1890s, anthropologists discovered that indigenous islanders in
New Guinea described the sky as black or dirty like water. Which, if you think about
it, isn't that surprising. Even if you look at a
color picker in Photoshop, it's clear that a dark or
navy blue isn't actually that far from being black, and is quite far from other hues which we would still call blue. In that sense, black would
have been a much broader term for early and ancient humans. It's kinda like how these
are all shades of red. We wouldn't call them
different colors necessarily. But this, in English, we call pink. Even though it's technically
just another shade of red, we've decided to categorize it as separate and as a result, it's
different in our minds. Of course, even if we didn't name it pink, we'd still be able to see
that it's a different color, a lighter hue, but ultimately, we'd
consider it a form of red. Now, you might be thinking
this just seems semantic. So what, they have different names. There's no functional difference in the actual color we're seeing. But neuroscience has
found that to be untrue. It turns out, and this is mind blowing, that language trains our brain
to see colors differently. What this means is once we
have a new word for a color, there's a feedback loop in the brain and this exaggerates the
differences between those colors, especially at the border
areas between them. We get used to calling these
colors as distinct hues and as a result, the
brain more aptly sees them as distinct hues. Without the word, you
would still see the color, but you wouldn't notice or
contextualize it in the same way. If that still feels bizarre,
because I know it did for me, think about learning a new language. At first, everything just
looks or sounds like gibberish. You can't tell the verbs
apart from the nouns, let alone one word from the next, because you are just learning. But slowly over time, your
brain starts to pick up on these categories and patterns and can recognize minor
differences much faster. It's not like you couldn't tell the words were different before, but it all sort of blended together. Once you become more familiar with it, you start to see and hear
those words much more clearly. Honestly, it's kinda like when
I learn a new English word and then suddenly I hear it everywhere, I see it everywhere. But the truth is I probably
came across that word before but just didn't notice it. But now that I've surely learned the word, the feedback loop is there
and so I truly notice it. It's a wild example of
how our amazing brains have allowed us to create language, but then that language turned back around and has an impact on brain function. Not only is our perception
of the world an illusion, our brains are an active
part of creating it. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found it as
interesting as I genuinely did. If you like our videos,

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say Question 1 is the most similar in terms of format, but it is not similar in terms of content or intent.

It would be more accurate to say that there is no matching generated MCQ for the given ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
- Why is the sky blue? It's one of the most common questions asked by both kids and adults, unless you're from ancient Greece. I know, I know, you'd think the country that is now ubiquitously known
for beautiful blue rooftops, crystal blue waters, and a blue flag would have a longer
history with the color. But if you were to read Homer, uh, not that one, the famous ancient Greek writer
from the 8th century B.C., you'd notice that the word
blue isn't mentioned once. Through thousands of pages of
"The Iliad" and "The Odyssey," black is mentioned 170 times,
white 100, red 13 times, yellow and green each around
10, but blue never appears. What's weirder is that
Homer describes things that we would normally
call blue, like the ocean, as wine-dark. He even calls honey
green and sheep violet. For a while, some suggested that maybe the ancient Greeks just saw
colors different than we do, or maybe they were all color blind. But we now know that
color vision developed around 30 million years
ago so that's not it. It gets even crazier. As historians and researchers
began looking into other ancient civilizations,
they realized the same thing. Almost none of them used the word blue. From Icelandic texts
to ancient Indian epics dating to about four millennia ago, to ancient Chinese writings, and even the original Hebrew Bible, all of them fail to mention blue once, while all of them mention
black, white, and red, and many, the Bible included,
also mention green and yellow. Again, it's not like they
don't talk about things that we would call blue. They describe the ocean
as wide, stormy, silent, but never blue. It wasn't until the mid-1800s that linguists began to analyze
the history of languages and found something peculiar. In every culture, black
and white are first. Then the first color to enter
the language is always red. Then yellow follows, then green. And then blue is the final
color to enter language in every single culture. Over the years, researchers have found some minor exceptions
with the middle order, so green and yellow, but red is always first
and blue is always last in every single language. So, why this order? There's two main theories. First, the evolutionary
explanation is simple. Black and white help distinguish
between night and day, light and dark, and are
the most clear and useful, so every culture has those. Then red, it's often associated
with blood or danger. Even human faces and communication use red through the galvanic skin response, like when you blush or are stressed. Green and yellow entered language
as the need to distinguish between ripe and unripe foods. And blue? There's very few blue things
that we actually interact with. Blue fruits are pretty rare. Blue animals are rare too. And when they are blue,
it's often not a pigment, but a sort of light illusion,
like in butterflies. Even the modern European
language words for blue are derived from ancient
words for black or green. The second explanation suggests that these words don't enter language until humans could make them. Red being the easiest and
most accessible color, because you just take a piece of dry clay and use it as a crayon. If you think of cave, for example, there's a lot of black and red in them. But blue? It's one of the hardest colors to create. For thousands because of years, nobody had it except the Egyptians, and they had a word for it. So does this mean that
ancient people couldn't see those colors before
they had a word for it? Not exactly. Early humans would have considered colors as simply hues of black, white, or red, which sounds kind of crazy, but there's actually modern
day evidence for this. If you look at these 12 colors, can you spot the one that's different? We might think clearly it's this one, but when presented with a similar chart, the Himba people of Namibia, who don't have a separate word for blue, take longer to point out this distinction. On the contrary, when
looking at green colors, they are more quickly able
to note the difference that we wouldn't catch
as quickly, this one. And this is because they have
more words for types of green than we do in English. In fact, one of their
color categories clumps some types of blue and green together, while they have other color categories for different greens still. In the 1890s, anthropologists discovered that indigenous islanders in
New Guinea described the sky as black or dirty like water. Which, if you think about
it, isn't that surprising. Even if you look at a
color picker in Photoshop, it's clear that a dark or
navy blue isn't actually that far from being black, and is quite far from other hues which we would still call blue. In that sense, black would
have been a much broader term for early and ancient humans. It's kinda like how these
are all shades of red. We wouldn't call them
different colors necessarily. But this, in English, we call pink. Even though it's technically
just another shade of red, we've decided to categorize it as separate and as a result, it's
different in our minds. Of course, even if we didn't name it pink, we'd still be able to see
that it's a different color, a lighter hue, but ultimately, we'd
consider it a form of red. Now, you might be thinking
this just seems semantic. So what, they have different names. There's no functional difference in the actual color we're seeing. But neuroscience has
found that to be untrue. It turns out, and this is mind blowing, that language trains our brain
to see colors differently. What this means is once we
have a new word for a color, there's a feedback loop in the brain and this exaggerates the
differences between those colors, especially at the border
areas between them. We get used to calling these
colors as distinct hues and as a result, the
brain more aptly sees them as distinct hues. Without the word, you
would still see the color, but you wouldn't notice or
contextualize it in the same way. If that still feels bizarre,
because I know it did for me, think about learning a new language. At first, everything just
looks or sounds like gibberish. You can't tell the verbs
apart from the nouns, let alone one word from the next, because you are just learning. But slowly over time, your
brain starts to pick up on these categories and patterns and can recognize minor
differences much faster. It's not like you couldn't tell the words were different before, but it all sort of blended together. Once you become more familiar with it, you start to see and hear
those words much more clearly. Honestly, it's kinda like when
I learn a new English word and then suddenly I hear it everywhere, I see it everywhere. But the truth is I probably
came across that word before but just didn't notice it. But now that I've surely learned the word, the feedback loop is there
and so I truly notice it. It's a wild example of
how our amazing brains have allowed us to create language, but then that language turned back around and has an impact on brain function. Not only is our perception
of the world an illusion, our brains are an active
part of creating it. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found it as
interesting as I genuinely did. If you like our videos,

**Transcript**:
[GO PROJECT FILMS] [When a Town Runs Dry] [♪ music ♪] My grandfather started the farm. And we've been farming here
ever since. For the last couple years, we
haven't had the crop production that we're used to
when we have adequate water. We're struggling. I've had to sell some property
to try to keep in business. The little bit of land
that we did sell was a very emotional thing to do because
that's land that I worked with my dad and it's gone. Growing up in Stratford was
a wonderful thing as a child. [children talking] The canals were always filled
with water. We could spend a whole day
at the canal trying to catch crawdads,
hunting for frogs, fishing. We'd ride our bikes off
into the river. And we would swim in it. Nowadays,
there's no water there. I grew up in Yemen. Living over there
was really hard. So that is why we came
to the United States. First we moved to Oakland but I didn't feel
like home there. I wanted to move
to a smaller city. That's when I found Stratford. I really like living here but sometimes it gets hard
with the work. Since the drought has started we lost half the business. Most of the people
that come to my store they work for the farmers. Most of the farmers
they get broke, the workers they go
somewhere else to find work. I really feel bad
about the people. They have a rough time. This makes me sad because we were welcomed
by all the people here. Being able to work
with the ground and with nature
has been very satisfying. But of late
when the water has become scarce we don't get a lot of help
from the people who want the food
that we grow. This year probably two-thirds
to half of our farm has not been put
into cultivation because of lack of water. Without food production,
there's no jobs out in the rural communities. When you have the commodity
we tend to not plan for the future. Otherwise
we should have been planning years ago. You don't start thinking
about reality until you start seeing
the writing on the wall. Water is one thing, but you take a step back
and you look at what's going on in the community,
and it's heartbreaking. You've got to be grateful
for the people that are there from dusk to dawn
or even later than that. When those stores
close their doors, we're really going to be hurting
in that little community. You know, where are our kids
going to be able to go to go get a snack? When people don't have the money I start to run a tab with them. Some people they pay me back, some people they can't
because no work. Okay Kenny, thank you. - You have a good day.
- We'll see you next time. When you know the people when they can't make
no money, no work, it's hard to say "you know"
pay me my money back and you know they don't have it. We lost a lot. Sometimes you think I don't know
what to do anymore and we just keep going. Anything helps, you know,
anything helps. Any time someone puts
a little bit more effort into the community, [whistle]
the community stands stronger. And you just hope that it grasps
and it keeps moving forward. I would like my kids
to take over the farm and keep it going but
if it continues to deteriorate then the future is not bright
in agriculture. [cheering] The only thing we can do
is sell more land and that's like selling
part of yourself. [screams] There's no better life. It's not fast. There's not
a lot of money in it, but it's a fair living. So it would really be sad for me
to see this lifestyle come to an end. I hope the water
is coming back. When the rain comes back I hope a lot of work
and a lot of people come back. I really like living
in this town. I don't want to leave this town. [credits] [©2016 Go Project Films]

**Transcript**:
[GO PROJECT FILMS] [When a Town Runs Dry] [♪ music ♪] My grandfather started the farm. And we've been farming here
ever since. For the last couple years, we
haven't had the crop production that we're used to
when we have adequate water. We're struggling. I've had to sell some property
to try to keep in business. The little bit of land
that we did sell was a very emotional thing to do because
that's land that I worked with my dad and it's gone. Growing up in Stratford was
a wonderful thing as a child. [children talking] The canals were always filled
with water. We could spend a whole day
at the canal trying to catch crawdads,
hunting for frogs, fishing. We'd ride our bikes off
into the river. And we would swim in it. Nowadays,
there's no water there. I grew up in Yemen. Living over there
was really hard. So that is why we came
to the United States. First we moved to Oakland but I didn't feel
like home there. I wanted to move
to a smaller city. That's when I found Stratford. I really like living here but sometimes it gets hard
with the work. Since the drought has started we lost half the business. Most of the people
that come to my store they work for the farmers. Most of the farmers
they get broke, the workers they go
somewhere else to find work. I really feel bad
about the people. They have a rough time. This makes me sad because we were welcomed
by all the people here. Being able to work
with the ground and with nature
has been very satisfying. But of late
when the water has become scarce we don't get a lot of help
from the people who want the food
that we grow. This year probably two-thirds
to half of our farm has not been put
into cultivation because of lack of water. Without food production,
there's no jobs out in the rural communities. When you have the commodity
we tend to not plan for the future. Otherwise
we should have been planning years ago. You don't start thinking
about reality until you start seeing
the writing on the wall. Water is one thing, but you take a step back
and you look at what's going on in the community,
and it's heartbreaking. You've got to be grateful
for the people that are there from dusk to dawn
or even later than that. When those stores
close their doors, we're really going to be hurting
in that little community. You know, where are our kids
going to be able to go to go get a snack? When people don't have the money I start to run a tab with them. Some people they pay me back, some people they can't
because no work. Okay Kenny, thank you. - You have a good day.
- We'll see you next time. When you know the people when they can't make
no money, no work, it's hard to say "you know"
pay me my money back and you know they don't have it. We lost a lot. Sometimes you think I don't know
what to do anymore and we just keep going. Anything helps, you know,
anything helps. Any time someone puts
a little bit more effort into the community, [whistle]
the community stands stronger. And you just hope that it grasps
and it keeps moving forward. I would like my kids
to take over the farm and keep it going but
if it continues to deteriorate then the future is not bright
in agriculture. [cheering] The only thing we can do
is sell more land and that's like selling
part of yourself. [screams] There's no better life. It's not fast. There's not
a lot of money in it, but it's a fair living. So it would really be sad for me
to see this lifestyle come to an end. I hope the water
is coming back. When the rain comes back I hope a lot of work
and a lot of people come back. I really like living
in this town. I don't want to leave this town. [credits] [©2016 Go Project Films]

**Transcript**:
This... requires your full attention. And if you have headphones or earbuds, use
them! They’ll make the experience better. Okay, here we go. All of these clips, or at least the audio
from them, have been used in scientific studies where researchers have tried to make people’s
hair stand on end; and cause what we commonly know as goose bumps, goose flesh, chilly bumps,
or goose pimples. The scientific term for this is the pilomotor
reflex or “piloerection”… I probably won’t use that word again. Really, all sorts of things can give you goosebumps. And I want you to think of the last time you
remember experiencing them. Was it at the beginning of this video? And if not, was it from cold? Or music? A movie? Were you just having an intense emotional
response to something? The most obvious time we experience goosebumps
is when we’re cold. In this case, your hair standing on end creates
a buffer between your skin and the cold air, helping you thermoregulate. This makes sense, but why do we also get goosebumps
from listening to music or watching a movie? Let’s take a closer look. There’s a tiny muscle at the base of every
individual hair on your body, the arrector pili. When these muscles contract, they pull on
your hairs, making them stand upright. And when they relax, the hair lies flat again. These are involuntary muscles and they’re
part of our sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for most fight or flight responses. The reaction is closely tied to our emotional
state. And apart from being cold, this is why movies
may be the best trigger for goosebumps. Movies tend to simulate social interactions,
and the combination of both audio and visual stimuli can trigger intense flight or fight
responses, resulting in adrenaline release, and that tiny arrector pili muscle contraction. But listening to music also causes goosebumps
in a vast majority of adults – though the reasons are a little more nuanced. One theory suggests that just the structure
and nature of music itself are sufficient to cause goosebumps, because it creates anticipation
in the brain. Often, our minds automatically try to predict
what fits next within a song, and the internal stakes build while we listen. If our predictions are correct, we receive
a dopamine release and eventually this can be enough to cause a chilling sensation. One study found that Samuel Barber’s Adagio
for Strings, what’s what’s playing in the background right now, was extremely effective
in causing goosebumps in a majority of people. Another theory suggests that sad songs are
more likely to cause chills than happy songs, and depending on who you ask, this could be
because sad or nostalgic music recreates the chilling feeling of social loss. Feeling separate from your family or social
group is known to give rise to goosebumps, but the reason why isn’t well understood. We do know that getting shivers down the spine
from music activates the same brain structures as other things that make us feel euphoric
– like food and some drugs. Brain imaging studies have found that goosebumps
activates structures like the amygdala and parts of the prefrontal cortex, and they’re
commonly involved in pleasure and reward. Getting the chills can make us feel good,
but when you think about it, if we didn’t get them, lots of other things would make
us feel good too. Like our friends, or cake. Goosebumps… are pretty useless. But chills are more useful to cats, dogs and
many other animals– their hair stands on end when they’re especially worked up or
afraid. The same pilomotor reflex that we get makes
them look bigger, scarier and may deter predators. Imagine you’re an echidna. Similar bundles of muscles at the base of
their quills allows them to move their quills independently, for protection. And for us, goosebumps are a remnant of evolution. Our hair standing on end kept us warm before
clothing and it may have deterred predators as well. These chills are a weird and wonderful quirk
of our biology that you can, quite literally, see on the skin of a goose. Goosebumps have many different names in different
countries – Goose skin, skin of the hen, chicken skin, duck skin and bird skin. Let me know what you call it, and if there’s
any movies or songs that specifically cause it, down in the comments.

**Transcript**:
This... requires your full attention. And if you have headphones or earbuds, use
them! They’ll make the experience better. Okay, here we go. All of these clips, or at least the audio
from them, have been used in scientific studies where researchers have tried to make people’s
hair stand on end; and cause what we commonly know as goose bumps, goose flesh, chilly bumps,
or goose pimples. The scientific term for this is the pilomotor
reflex or “piloerection”… I probably won’t use that word again. Really, all sorts of things can give you goosebumps. And I want you to think of the last time you
remember experiencing them. Was it at the beginning of this video? And if not, was it from cold? Or music? A movie? Were you just having an intense emotional
response to something? The most obvious time we experience goosebumps
is when we’re cold. In this case, your hair standing on end creates
a buffer between your skin and the cold air, helping you thermoregulate. This makes sense, but why do we also get goosebumps
from listening to music or watching a movie? Let’s take a closer look. There’s a tiny muscle at the base of every
individual hair on your body, the arrector pili. When these muscles contract, they pull on
your hairs, making them stand upright. And when they relax, the hair lies flat again. These are involuntary muscles and they’re
part of our sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for most fight or flight responses. The reaction is closely tied to our emotional
state. And apart from being cold, this is why movies
may be the best trigger for goosebumps. Movies tend to simulate social interactions,
and the combination of both audio and visual stimuli can trigger intense flight or fight
responses, resulting in adrenaline release, and that tiny arrector pili muscle contraction. But listening to music also causes goosebumps
in a vast majority of adults – though the reasons are a little more nuanced. One theory suggests that just the structure
and nature of music itself are sufficient to cause goosebumps, because it creates anticipation
in the brain. Often, our minds automatically try to predict
what fits next within a song, and the internal stakes build while we listen. If our predictions are correct, we receive
a dopamine release and eventually this can be enough to cause a chilling sensation. One study found that Samuel Barber’s Adagio
for Strings, what’s what’s playing in the background right now, was extremely effective
in causing goosebumps in a majority of people. Another theory suggests that sad songs are
more likely to cause chills than happy songs, and depending on who you ask, this could be
because sad or nostalgic music recreates the chilling feeling of social loss. Feeling separate from your family or social
group is known to give rise to goosebumps, but the reason why isn’t well understood. We do know that getting shivers down the spine
from music activates the same brain structures as other things that make us feel euphoric
– like food and some drugs. Brain imaging studies have found that goosebumps
activates structures like the amygdala and parts of the prefrontal cortex, and they’re
commonly involved in pleasure and reward. Getting the chills can make us feel good,
but when you think about it, if we didn’t get them, lots of other things would make
us feel good too. Like our friends, or cake. Goosebumps… are pretty useless. But chills are more useful to cats, dogs and
many other animals– their hair stands on end when they’re especially worked up or
afraid. The same pilomotor reflex that we get makes
them look bigger, scarier and may deter predators. Imagine you’re an echidna. Similar bundles of muscles at the base of
their quills allows them to move their quills independently, for protection. And for us, goosebumps are a remnant of evolution. Our hair standing on end kept us warm before
clothing and it may have deterred predators as well. These chills are a weird and wonderful quirk
of our biology that you can, quite literally, see on the skin of a goose. Goosebumps have many different names in different
countries – Goose skin, skin of the hen, chicken skin, duck skin and bird skin. Let me know what you call it, and if there’s
any movies or songs that specifically cause it, down in the comments.

**Transcript**:
[Music] chances are you or someone you know is a vegetarian so we thought we'd try a thought experiment what would happen if everyone in the world was suddenly a vegetarian what effect would it have on our lives and the planet before we begin full disclosure none of us at ASAP science are vegetarians and the worldwide rate of vegetarianism is fairly low ranging from about 4 to 5% in the US and Canada to a little over 30% in India as a result there are currently about 20 billion chickens 1 5 billion cows over a billion sheep and nearly a billion pigs in the world without any meate eating humans to provide a market whole herds of domestic animals would disappear and this would free up vast quantities of land about 33 million square km of land are used for pasture an area about the size of Africa and that's not even counting the land used to grow crops exclusively for animal feed some of it would be needed for the increased amount of vegetable crops but much of the land currently used as pasture is actually too dry to grow crops without humans adding artificial nutrients this land could turn to desert but if properly managed it's possible that some Farmland would return to its natural state of grassland or Forest which could help counteract global climate change after all the loss of CO2 absorbing trees cleared for agriculture is a major reason why Global levels of CO2 are going up cows and other grazers also affect our climate through large amounts of methane production which has 25 times more potential planet warming power than CO2 combined with the loss of forests and other effects livestock production is responsible for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all the world's Planes Trains and Automobiles put together in fact many scientists believe that reducing meat consumption may be one of the best strategies for managing climate change a vegetarian diet would also greatly reduce water consumption around 70% of global freshwater consumption is used in agriculture it takes 15,000 L to make a kg of beef 6,000 L for pork and 4,000 L for chicken compare this with 1,600 L for cereal crops 900 L for fruit and 300 L for garden vegetables of course a kilogram of meat packs many more calories than the equivalent weight of fruit but even if you compare the ratio of water per calorie of available food energy beef is still five times more water intensive than fruit seven times more than veggies and 20 times more than cereal so are there any downsides to a vegetarian diet Well we'd be left without a cheap source for many byproducts of livestock like leather from animal hides or animal fats which are used in cosmetics candles and detergents and while vegetable-based Alternatives do exist their production would need to increase meaning more land dedicated to growing crops and less restored to its natural state a more complicated fact is that raising and processing animals is a full-time job for more than 1 billion people most of whom are small-scale farmers in the developing World while some may be able to move to producing milk or eggs or even Growing Vegetable crops many would be faced with their way of life becoming obsolete of course any increase in vegetarianism is likely to be a gradual process rather than a sudden cut off and surprisingly the trends are actually in the opposite direction in places like India and China people are becoming wealthier and as a result consuming more meat which effectively cancels out the declines we see in other countries so we actually tried to go vegetarian for 21 days straight as an experiment in our new ASAP thought episode check out the video if you want to see how it went what we learned in the process and how we felt about it both mentally and physically And subscribe for more weekly science videos

**Transcript**:
Winter is coming - and we've all been told to put on a jacket outside, or you'll catch a cold! Of course, the common response of today has become 'Don't be silly, being cold can't give you a cold'. Or can it? Who wins in this battle of the beliefs? The correlation between cold weather and sickness does stand out. Between 5-20% of Americans catch a cold or flu every year around late fall and winter. Not to mention, it's called a cold. But there are some important things to consider. First and foremost: colds and the flu are caused by viruses. if there aren't any around, you won't catch a cold - no matter how cold you get. It's as simple as that. So why the correlation with decreasing temperatures? Well for one, people tend to stay indoors much more often during the winter, which in turn, puts them in contact with more people. More people, means more exposure opportunities for the pathogens to spread. On top of this, humidity plays a role in the spread of some viruses. As the humidity decreases in the winter, not only does the virus spread more readily, but the mucus in your nose dries out. Mucus would otherwise act as a protective barrier to pathogens. Finnaly, the lack of Vitamin D which we get from the sun, can affect  our immune system adversely. Both being inside more often, and the fact that winter has shorter days makes this a big factor for your health. So you've proven your parents wrong... right? Not so fast! While some past studies have shown no correlation to temperature, recent evidence suggest otherwise. One study which put test subjects feet into ice water found that they were, indeed, more likely to develop common cold symptoms in the following days, than those who didn't. The developing hypothesis behind these results is that the cold temperatures cause blood vessel constriction, which slows the white blood cells from reaching the virus, ultimately inhibiting the immune response. Cortisol levels, which pressures the immune system, are also increased with temperature induced stress. Furthermore, studies on both mice and human airway cells found that immune reaction to the common cold virus, in fact, temperature dependent. Warm infected cells are more likely to undergo programmed cell death, to limit the spread of infection. Finally, studies of the virus itself have revealed a secret weapon of sorts. In winter temperature, the virus's outer layer or envelope becomes much harder and acts like a shield. This allows it to spread from person to person much more easily. But at warm temperatures, this layer is more of a gel, which is not quite tough enough to protect the virus against the elements. As a result, its spreading ability is compromised. So, maybe your parents weren't so wrong after all. A happy compromise of going outside more often, bundled up, is likely to get you through the winter unscathed. New to AsapSCIENCE?

**Transcript**:
Winter is coming - and we've all been told to put on a jacket outside, or you'll catch a cold! Of course, the common response of today has become 'Don't be silly, being cold can't give you a cold'. Or can it? Who wins in this battle of the beliefs? The correlation between cold weather and sickness does stand out. Between 5-20% of Americans catch a cold or flu every year around late fall and winter. Not to mention, it's called a cold. But there are some important things to consider. First and foremost: colds and the flu are caused by viruses. if there aren't any around, you won't catch a cold - no matter how cold you get. It's as simple as that. So why the correlation with decreasing temperatures? Well for one, people tend to stay indoors much more often during the winter, which in turn, puts them in contact with more people. More people, means more exposure opportunities for the pathogens to spread. On top of this, humidity plays a role in the spread of some viruses. As the humidity decreases in the winter, not only does the virus spread more readily, but the mucus in your nose dries out. Mucus would otherwise act as a protective barrier to pathogens. Finnaly, the lack of Vitamin D which we get from the sun, can affect  our immune system adversely. Both being inside more often, and the fact that winter has shorter days makes this a big factor for your health. So you've proven your parents wrong... right? Not so fast! While some past studies have shown no correlation to temperature, recent evidence suggest otherwise. One study which put test subjects feet into ice water found that they were, indeed, more likely to develop common cold symptoms in the following days, than those who didn't. The developing hypothesis behind these results is that the cold temperatures cause blood vessel constriction, which slows the white blood cells from reaching the virus, ultimately inhibiting the immune response. Cortisol levels, which pressures the immune system, are also increased with temperature induced stress. Furthermore, studies on both mice and human airway cells found that immune reaction to the common cold virus, in fact, temperature dependent. Warm infected cells are more likely to undergo programmed cell death, to limit the spread of infection. Finally, studies of the virus itself have revealed a secret weapon of sorts. In winter temperature, the virus's outer layer or envelope becomes much harder and acts like a shield. This allows it to spread from person to person much more easily. But at warm temperatures, this layer is more of a gel, which is not quite tough enough to protect the virus against the elements. As a result, its spreading ability is compromised. So, maybe your parents weren't so wrong after all. A happy compromise of going outside more often, bundled up, is likely to get you through the winter unscathed. New to AsapSCIENCE?

**Transcript**:
7 a.m kirill petrov the man of the house the 
first thing that he does every morning is to   heat the house with a wood burning stove to keep 
his family warm on the ice cold morning in yakutia because of the severe climate 
he really needs a lot of wood   to hit the house for nine months non-stop just like a dessert drinking water in yakut 
village is precious there are no water treatment   facilities because the pipes freeze during the 
long winter so ice is the main source of water   kirill and the villagers harvested the ice 
from the river in the middle of november   when the temperature was favorable to harvest eyes meanwhile kirill's wife liubov is making delicious 
untraditional breakfast kercheh whipped cream with   a strawberry germ which was harvested during the 
summer in yakutia during the harsh climate it's   almost impossible to grow fruits and vegetables so 
most of the yogurt desserts consist of dairy food it's 7 40 am and it's time for 
arian the youngest son to wake up arian is nine years old and 
attends the local primary school   the children in yakutia will go to school 
when it's warmer than minus 54 degrees   but when the temperature drops below minus 
55 degrees it's too dangerous to go to school   today is relatively warm in yakutia only minus 
40 degrees which means aryan must go to school like most people around the world he wash his face   and brush his teeth arian uses the ice 
cold water that his dad prepared earlier breakfast fatty pancakes and whipped cream are 
high energy food that warms you up during cold   winters aryan's older sisters are living and 
studying in university far away from the village   his parents wish for him to study well 
so he can live his life as he wants um locals understand the importance 
of learning the right clothing   to survive in such extreme winters it's an 
absolute must to wear several layers of clothing   and wear insulated pumps because the 
knees are particularly prone to freezing aryan's mom always makes sure that everyone 
wears enough clothes because without proper   dressing the cold will reach deep inside 
your bones threatening your life she also   makes sure that his face is fully covered 
otherwise the exposed part can get frostbite the temperature outside is so cold so the moisture 
immediately forms little icicles on his eyelashes   10 minutes in the fresh air can be enough 
to cause fatigue stinging pain in the face   and long-lasting eggs in the fingers and toes but 
little harder yogurts knows how to find the cold but after a few minutes the icy weather 
begins to assert itself forcefully   aryan has been on his way for 10 minutes already 
and now the nine years old aryan is freezing luckily the last few meters are 
left and arian is finally at school aryan arrives in time and there are already 
many children who have also arrived by food   arian is studying in the third grade 
of primary school the primary school   last four years and in yakuza education 
last 11 years before going to university there are about eight students in the class 
today and five hours of daily studying begins today they have math literature 
art geography history and languages   yakut people study three languages at school 
russian english and sakha sakha is the mother   tongue which belonged to the turkey group and 
is totally different from the russian language   for daily life studying and working 
knowing the russian language is essentially after the first two lessons it's time for 
a second breakfast today menu is apple and   x eating regularly is essential to increase 
energy in the cold winters for little yakuts after breakfast the play indoors the 
temperature is too cold to play outside   and after all it takes too long to dress up again usually the classes end at 2 pm but today arian 
finished a little earlier now he's on his way   back home with his friend and like kids all around 
the world they can't ignore the local snack shop   everyone likes ice cream and aryan 
and his friends are no exception   they love sweet and creamy frozen 
ice cream despite the extreme cold aryan and his friends on their way home 
are playing little games and having fun   parents are not worried about their 
children it's a close-knit community   all the locals know each other and there 
are about 800 people in the whole village almost all the houses are made 
of wood each resident burns   more than 60 cubic meters on average every winter   for the house to keep warm and to protect 
the house from the freezing air they make   sure to fill every gap with oakum or snow but 
still the cold finds a way to come through wild yogurt and horses are also neighbors 
in this icy land they have thick skin and   heavy hair coat and are able to effectively 
forage in the snow for vegetation to eat   the yakutian horses can cope with 
temperatures down to minus 70 degrees thank you aryan is back home and ready to help 
his father most men in the village are   engaged in the cattle breeding hunting 
or crafts same as aryan's father i mean is well known craftsman in yakutia 
kirill makes traditional yakut knives   for many centuries knives have played an important 
role in the lives and the culture of yakut people   yakut knives are well known around the 
world for their strengths and beauty aryan's father is teaching him these traditional 
crafts that has been passed through the   generations the plate is traditionally 
forged from the locally sourced iron ore   the knife handle is made from birch 
wood which is extremely strong my another of aryan's daily 
duties is to chop the firewood   aryan knows from early age that daily work 
is necessary to survive in such extreme cold so now it's time for lunch and arian 
is always here to help his mom   they are preparing a christian carp 
fish which his stats caught in the river   people love eating fish and meat 
in a frozen boiled or fried state after the work is done aryan 
rushes to the toilets outside   in yakutia there are no indoors toilets because 
the pipes freeze easily everything happens   outside the stand very efficiently and no one 
spends more time than necessary out in the cold this fish is aryan's favorite it's 
so tasty and the most delicious   fat and nutritious part is the fish real eggs uh hmm foreign fishing and hunting are important sources of 
food in yakutia from early spring until the   autumn cold the yakuts are eating fish aryan loves 
fishing with his father at the beginning of march   it's the perfect time for kuiuur 
which is traditional ice fishing using their rods and nuts they start fishing arian loves spending time with his 
father in nature they are fishing   hunting and working hard to survive in this 
extremely cold but beautiful land yakuta after a few hours finally 
aryan has caught the fish you don't need to worry about bonking the fish 
because in just a few seconds it's shock frozen life in yakutia can be difficult unpleasant 
and dangerous but we have learned how to live   in harmony is mother nature and we appreciate 
the nature treasures and gifts that surround   us we can always find a beauty even in this 
extremely cold climate after all there is   no such thing as the bad weather there is 
just weather and your attitude towards it

**Transcript**:
FLORA LICHTMAN: When
astronauts go up in space, they're allowed to bring
some special items. DON PETTIT: Some astronauts
fly M&M's, some people fly beef jerky. FLORA LICHTMAN: Don Pettit,
this guy, chose candy corn. He's a NASA astronaut
who spent nearly half a year floating around the
International Space Station. And while he was up in space-- DON PETTIT: I elected to
spend my off-duty time doing science of my own design. FLORA LICHTMAN: Like this
zero-gravity candy corn demonstration. DON PETTIT: It's a
macroscopic analogy to how a surfactant molecule works. FLORA LICHTMAN: And a
surfactant molecule just means-- DON PETTIT: Soap. FLORA LICHTMAN: So in
this demo, a candy corn is equivalent to
a soap molecule. And this water blob
represents grease or oil. And basically the demo shows
how soap cleans grease. Soap molecules have
a water loving end-- DON PETTIT: So they
call that hydrophilic. FLORA LICHTMAN: And
a water heating end-- DON PETTIT: Hydrophobic. FLORA LICHTMAN: And
that's important. DON PETTIT: Say you
have a blob of oil, and you throw it in
a washing machine, the hydrophobic
part of the molecule sticks into the
grease and the oil and the hydrophilic part
pokes up into the water. FLORA LICHTMAN: In candy corn,
the hydrophobic/hydrophilic sides are reversed-- this part is water
loving and Pettit coated this side with oil
to make it water hating. But the principle is the same. The molecules, or
the candy corn, arrange themselves around
the glob, based on attraction or repulsion to water. DON PETTIT: Of course, that's
how your clothes get clean. You cover them with these
hydrophilic/hydrophobic molecules, called soap. FLORA LICHTMAN: And once
the soap molecules fully cover the grease blob,
it becomes water-soluble. DON PETTIT: It's called the
critical micelle concentration. FLORA LICHTMAN:
Or in candy corn-- DON PETTIT: The critical
candy corn concentration. FLORA LICHTMAN: Once it
hits this concentration-- DON PETTIT: All the dirt
in the oil and the grease floats off of your fabric
and it mixes with the water and then you pour the
water off and you're left with clean clothes. FLORA LICHTMAN:
Now in candy corn there's a bonus science
lesson, after you reach the critical candy
corn concentration-- DON PETTIT: And a most
amazing thing happens. FLORA LICHTMAN: The blob
goes from smushy to rigid. You can think of it like-- DON PETTIT: Of putting the
keystone in a Roman arch. Where now, all of
a sudden, gravity locks all the stones together
and you have this rigid arch that you could
drive traffic across. FLORA LICHTMAN:
But we're in space. So it's not gravity at
work, it's surface tension holding the ball together. This was one of many
experiments Pettit did in space but it's the only one
that used candy corn. DON PETTIT: And I used our whole
crew's supply of candy corn for this one demonstration,
which I profusely apologized to the
rest of the crew because they didn't get eat any. For Science Friday,
I'm Flora Lichtman. [MUSIC PLAYING]

skills in the new year, SciShow viewers get up to 65% off when you

from them, we can all agree that bees are beneficial
little critters. Various species make it possible for us to
have blueberries, and almonds, and, of course, honey. They pollinate flowers, they do that charming
little waggle dance, and they help corpses decompose. Yeah, I said corpses. Now, this isn’t something that all bees
do, so no need to look sideways at the jar of
honey on your kitchen counter. This is mainly a vulture bee thing. Vulture bees make up three species of bees
in the genus Trigona, and live in the rainforests of South and Central
America. Like honeybees, vulture bees are social hive-dwellers. They are also obligate necrophages, which
means they eat mostly carrion. or dead things. This is not the sort of cuisine that most
bees tend to be into. Though it’s worth mentioning that some bees
forage for both pollen and carrion. And vulture bees are not strictly carnivorous,
either. They do also get carbohydrates from plant
sources like fruit. And they hunt wasp larvae, because they weren’t
hardcore enough already I guess. But one thing they will never do is visit
a flower. They prefer a nice steak. The bees find a corpse, strip it, and bring
the meat back to the hive. After that, it’s not really clear what happens,
but it’s probably not a barbecue. Instead, the bees store the carrion away…
to do something. The bees might use the meat to produce hypopharyngeal
gland secretions, which is what honeybees use to make the royal
jelly that feeds the queen and her young. They might also use it to make corpse honey. Which I’ve heard is just great on a sourdough
toast. Vulture bees evolved fairly recently from
pollen-eating ancestors. It’s definitely possible for an animal to
make this kind of dietary 180, but in order for it to work, something unusual has to happen in the gut
microbiome, the community of microbes that lives in the
animal’s gut. It is believed that all bees are descended
from a common ancestor that had five major types of microbe in its gut. And most bees still have all five. These microbes serve distinct jobs, like helping
break down toxic sugars that can sometimes be found in pollen. The authors of a 2021 study wanted to find
out how the microbiome of pollen-eating bees compared to the microbiome of vulture bees. They found that vulture bees still have some
of those same microbes. But not all of them. And they have new ones, too. Unsurprisingly, they have microbes that are
strictly for meat eating. But not as many as researchers expected them
to have. They also have some of the same microbes pollen-eating
bees have. Now, this might mean that the microbes adapted
to the carrion diet as the bees did. But, it might also mean that those microbes
were doing something unrelated to diet in the first place. For example, certain microbes in the microbiomes
of other insects may help protect their host from disease by preventing the overgrowth
of pathogenic bacteria. It's not really clear, though, how the change
in microbiome happened. It's kind of a chicken and egg thing. Like, whether the bacteria changed first,
and that made the change in diet possible. Or whether the microbiome changed because
the bees’ diet changed. And vulture bees, like all bees, are descended
from meat-eating wasps, so in the end these bees are kind of just
getting back to their roots. And the about face in their gut microbes can
tell us a lot about how the microbiome adapts to changes in diet. Not bad for the makers of corpse honey. We cannot teach you the language of bee dances, but you can learn human languages with today’s
sponsor, Babbel. Learning a new language might be on your list

skills in the new year, SciShow viewers get up to 65% off when you

from them, we can all agree that bees are beneficial
little critters. Various species make it possible for us to
have blueberries, and almonds, and, of course, honey. They pollinate flowers, they do that charming
little waggle dance, and they help corpses decompose. Yeah, I said corpses. Now, this isn’t something that all bees
do, so no need to look sideways at the jar of
honey on your kitchen counter. This is mainly a vulture bee thing. Vulture bees make up three species of bees
in the genus Trigona, and live in the rainforests of South and Central
America. Like honeybees, vulture bees are social hive-dwellers. They are also obligate necrophages, which
means they eat mostly carrion. or dead things. This is not the sort of cuisine that most
bees tend to be into. Though it’s worth mentioning that some bees
forage for both pollen and carrion. And vulture bees are not strictly carnivorous,
either. They do also get carbohydrates from plant
sources like fruit. And they hunt wasp larvae, because they weren’t
hardcore enough already I guess. But one thing they will never do is visit
a flower. They prefer a nice steak. The bees find a corpse, strip it, and bring
the meat back to the hive. After that, it’s not really clear what happens,
but it’s probably not a barbecue. Instead, the bees store the carrion away…
to do something. The bees might use the meat to produce hypopharyngeal
gland secretions, which is what honeybees use to make the royal
jelly that feeds the queen and her young. They might also use it to make corpse honey. Which I’ve heard is just great on a sourdough
toast. Vulture bees evolved fairly recently from
pollen-eating ancestors. It’s definitely possible for an animal to
make this kind of dietary 180, but in order for it to work, something unusual has to happen in the gut
microbiome, the community of microbes that lives in the
animal’s gut. It is believed that all bees are descended
from a common ancestor that had five major types of microbe in its gut. And most bees still have all five. These microbes serve distinct jobs, like helping
break down toxic sugars that can sometimes be found in pollen. The authors of a 2021 study wanted to find
out how the microbiome of pollen-eating bees compared to the microbiome of vulture bees. They found that vulture bees still have some
of those same microbes. But not all of them. And they have new ones, too. Unsurprisingly, they have microbes that are
strictly for meat eating. But not as many as researchers expected them
to have. They also have some of the same microbes pollen-eating
bees have. Now, this might mean that the microbes adapted
to the carrion diet as the bees did. But, it might also mean that those microbes
were doing something unrelated to diet in the first place. For example, certain microbes in the microbiomes
of other insects may help protect their host from disease by preventing the overgrowth
of pathogenic bacteria. It's not really clear, though, how the change
in microbiome happened. It's kind of a chicken and egg thing. Like, whether the bacteria changed first,
and that made the change in diet possible. Or whether the microbiome changed because
the bees’ diet changed. And vulture bees, like all bees, are descended
from meat-eating wasps, so in the end these bees are kind of just
getting back to their roots. And the about face in their gut microbes can
tell us a lot about how the microbiome adapts to changes in diet. Not bad for the makers of corpse honey. We cannot teach you the language of bee dances, but you can learn human languages with today’s
sponsor, Babbel. Learning a new language might be on your list

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Some people are so full of life and and energy, but for some reason even when you seem to get more than enough sleep, you're still fighting off yawns and fatigue through the day. So, why are you always tired? If you the number of the hours of sleep isn't the problem, the second most common cause of fatigue comes from lack of physical activity and a poor diet. Study after study finds that adults who began light exercise a few times a week reported more energy after six weeks. People who exercise more regularly also report sleeping better. Even though studies show that they aren't sleeping any longer. But if that doesn't help, don't go straight to your cup of joe. While many studies show that coffee is good for your health research show that your reliance on it can make you more sleepy. Caffeine blocks adenosine in your brain which normally accumulates through the day and makes you sleepy at night. But consuming coffee or energy drinks less that 6 hours before bed can ultimately affect your sleep quality. As a result people who don't use caffeine often report feeling less tired in the morning. You might consider making sure you're fully hydrated with some water first too. One study found that a drop of 1.5% in our bodies normal water levels can cause difficulty concentrating. Your blood thickens which slows down nutrients and oxygen getting to your muscles and organs. However a 2% drop is enough to make you feel thirsty so while there's no need to gulping down gallons of water. Staying hydrated throughout the day will certainly help. Urine should be pale yellow. Any darker and it's time for some water. Those glasses of wine or beers before bed may also be affecting your day. Studies have found that after becoming intoxicated while test subjects would fall asleep faster their quality of sleep was actually much lower, particularly during the second half of their night sleep. Ultimately alcohol reduces the amount of REM sleep you get. And, if you're binge drinking and sleeping in on the weekends be aware that a consistent sleep schedule is key. Try waking up close to your normal time on weekends and having short 20 minutes naps in the day. These will still recharge your body without going into deep sleep and making you more tired. You're also more likely to fall asleep at a correct time on Sunday evening making Moday morning easier. Of course your mental well-being plays a role too. Anxiety is a big one. Worrying what people think, always feeling tense about work or being overly concerned about every decision can be physically exhausting. And fatigue is one of the main symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Not only that, but anxiety may be affecting your sleep quality. On another serious end, depression can cause physical, and emotinal fatigue which more sleep won't necessarily relieve. For some it causes insomnia or inability to fall asleep in the first place. Unfortunately there's no quick fix for the 10% of Americans who do suffer from depression. So if you think you may be depressed see your physician or psychologist. Finally, you might also simply be a night owl. Around 20% of population have genetics making them predisposed to staying up late. But living in our nine-to-five world may make it difficult for you to get the proper amont of sleep. In fact, scientists call this phenomenon social jet lag. Well night owls feel like they're living in the wrong time zone every day. If nothing seems to help, there may be an underlying medical condition causing your fatigue which should be talked about with your physician. Got a burning question you want answered? Ask it in the comments or on Facebook and twitter and subscribe for more weekly science videos.

Studies have found that after becoming intoxicated while test subjects would fall asleep faster their quality of sleep was actually much lower, particularly during the second half of their night sleep. Ultimately alcohol reduces the amount of REM sleep you get. And, if you're binge drinking and sleeping in on the weekends be aware that a consistent sleep schedule is key. Try waking up close to your normal time on weekends and having short 20 minutes naps in the day. These will still recharge your body without going into deep sleep and making you more tired. You're also more likely to fall asleep at a correct time on Sunday evening making Moday morning easier. Of course your mental well-being plays a role too. Anxiety is a big one. Worrying what people think, always feeling tense about work or being overly concerned about every decision can be physically exhausting. And fatigue is one of the main symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder. Not only that, but anxiety may be affecting your sleep quality. On another serious end, depression can cause physical, and emotinal fatigue which more sleep won't necessarily relieve. For some it causes insomnia or inability to fall asleep in the first place. Unfortunately there's no quick fix for the 10% of Americans who do suffer from depression. So if you think you may be depressed see your physician or psychologist. Finally, you might also simply be a night owl. Around 20% of population have genetics making them predisposed to staying up late. But living in our nine-to-five world may make it difficult for you to get the proper amont of sleep. In fact, scientists call this phenomenon social jet lag. Well night owls feel like they're living in the wrong time zone every day. If nothing seems to help, there may be an underlying medical condition causing your fatigue which should be talked about with your physician. Got a burning question you want answered?

**Transcript**:
Some people are so full of life and and energy, but for some reason even when you seem to get more than enough sleep, you're still fighting off yawns and fatigue through the day. So, why are you always tired? If you the number of the hours of sleep isn't the problem, the second most common cause of fatigue comes from lack of physical activity and a poor diet. Study after study finds that adults who began light exercise a few times a week reported more energy after six weeks. People who exercise more regularly also report sleeping better. Even though studies show that they aren't sleeping any longer. But if that doesn't help, don't go straight to your cup of joe. While many studies show that coffee is good for your health research show that your reliance on it can make you more sleepy. Caffeine blocks adenosine in your brain which normally accumulates through the day and makes you sleepy at night. But consuming coffee or energy drinks less that 6 hours before bed can ultimately affect your sleep quality. As a result people who don't use caffeine often report feeling less tired in the morning. You might consider making sure you're fully hydrated with some water first too. One study found that a drop of 1.5% in our bodies normal water levels can cause difficulty concentrating. Your blood thickens which slows down nutrients and oxygen getting to your muscles and organs. However a 2% drop is enough to make you feel thirsty so while there's no need to gulping down gallons of water. Staying hydrated throughout the day will certainly help. Urine should be pale yellow.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
For thousands of years, humans, and plants
and animals long before that, have been using frozen “sky water” to keep warm. Which sort of doesn’t make sense. Because snow is cool. You might even say it’s… ice cold. YEEAAHHHHH! No one knows for sure who built the first
igloo, but with the right fit and the right physics, snow can actually warm you better
than the inside of a tauntaun. "You'll be ok, Luke!" So, how can something cold keep you cozy? [MUSIC] The vast, frozen Arctic is one of the most
forbidding environments on our planet, yet, the Inuit have managed to live there for about
5,000 years. Out on the pack ice, winter temperatures reach
50 degrees below zero , and when it’s that cold, surviving means finding shelter. It’s not an area known for its forests,
so nomadic hunters learned to build with the only thing available: snow. Eskimo languages really do have dozens and
dozens of different words for snow, because there are a lot of different types, and the
type of snow you choose can dictate whether your igloo keeps you warm, or turns you into
a Homo sapiensicle. To understand this, we need to know a little
something about being cold. When your body temperature starts to plummet
– you’re feeling heat leave you. Cold can’t move into your body – in fact,
there is no such thing as cold. Where have I heard that before? Oh, right! Think of heat as an actual quantity of stuff:. The more you give away, the colder you feel. This trading of heat can happen three different
ways: by convection, conduction, and radiation. All three are at play in an igloo. A person inside will radiate body heat, which
moves around the igloo by convection, and is lost through the walls by conduction. This is exactly what happens in your house. Living insulation does the same thing. Fatty tissues like blubber help stop heat
transfer in whales and seals, but for animals who don’t have as much junk in the trunk,
they cover themselves in air. Sea otter fur, for example, is about a thousand
times denser than human hair. It’s snuggly stuff
"This is the softest thing I've ever felt in my life. You are adorable!"
…but the secret to its insulation power is in its texture. Otter fur is spiky, so it traps insulating
air molecules. And that is exactly what snowflakes do. Powdery, fresh snow can be up to 95% trapped
air. This makes it an excellent insulator, but
the same way you have to pack it in your hands to make a snowball, it isn’t dense enough
to build with. Solid ice, on the other hand, makes a good
windbreaker, but it’s too heavy to lift. Inuit hunters took the Goldilocks approach:
the secret to good igloo snow is somewhere in the middle. Traditional igloo blocks aren’t molded,
they’re cut out of the ground. That tightly-packed ground snow is dense enough
to hold up, but because it still has far more air pockets than a block of ice, it’s light,
and still a pretty good insulator. As usual, animals figured this one out long
before humans. Polar bears, groundhogs, even birds like grouse
all make snow burrows to stay warm. And even before that, plants were tucking
into snow to avoid death by freezing. During the warm months, heat energy from the
sun builds up in soil, and just like the the roof above your head, a deep covering of snow
prevents that heat from escaping onward and upward. This snowy blanket above stops ice crystals
from forming inside plant roots, and shoots, and seeds. Not freezing to death is a pretty good motivator
for any animal to get crafty, but our big primate brains took it one step further with
igloos. Their engineering maximizes warmth and stability. Cartoon igloos look like flat-bottomed half-spheres,
but in reality, they’re neither of those things! If you were to slice a real igloo in half,
you’d see a shape called a catenary. This gradually sloping shape is the same one
that would form if you held a chain from both ends and let it droop. A catenary arch distributes weight more evenly
than a half circle, without bulging or buckling. In fact it’s one of the most stable arches
in nature, so sound that we still use it today. Inside, snow houses are carved in different
levels. The hot air rises, and the cold air sinks
down into the lower part, and away from where you would eat, sleep, and chill. To boot, body heat melts the innermost layer
of the walls, strengthening the barrier between you, your airy snow-block insulation, and
the frigid great beyond. When you live in an igloo, you act as a living
furnace. Over time, the temperature in your icy abode
can hover some 40-60 degrees above the surrounding air, but bring a friend to your igloo party,
and you’ll get warmer, faster. Stay cozy, and stay curious! "Hey, you remember that thing I said about
eskimos having all those different words for snow? Well our friends from Idea Channel made a
video about that. Here's an idea, you should go check it out. It's pretty cool."

**Transcript**:
now take a look at these two brains they look identical right they're the same size have roughly the same number of brain cells and the same number of connections between regions but one is smarter than the other so why well the answer might be in those connections so we used to think that bigger brains were better or that each part of the brain just had one job but now we're learning that almost everything the brain does it relies on a pattern of communication and this new way of thinking about your brain has some weird similarities with the game twister so I took my stocking feet game in search for an expert in this new way of thinking about thinking this big-picture perspective of how your brain works is called the networked neuroscience researchers use images of your brain like from a brain scanner to make a map of the major connections among your brain regions those regions become nodes in the network with connections or edges between them like stations in a network of train tracks this wiring of your brain network has different patterns that shift all the time when you learn or when you multitask and a new theory suggests that how this wiring ships in response to intellectual tasks is the best predictor of intelligence I am Danielle Bassets I am an associate professor of bioengineering care at the University of Pennsylvania and I'm a MacArthur Fellow so to detangle this network approach I came to UPenn to meet Danielle she analyzes how these brain networks respond to you doing certain activities like learning something new somebody learns by changing the pattern of connections and the brain and those pattern of connections tells you which parts of the brain are communicating with one another so what's happening now is we're learning is that different parts of the brain are communicating in ways that they didn't before and this is what twister comes in right foot on yellow oh the structure of the game is a simplified way to think of these networks in your brain it's like a network in your brain because different parts of your brain are like us so I'm a part of the brain you are a part of the brain you're making three connections to two blue areas and one yellow area and I'm making two connections to two red areas as we play a game we're going to change the connections and as a person learns these connections between brain regions can change they can connect and put apart and connect again so this pattern may be illustrative of the connectivity at one particular point in time but then it would reconfigure to form new connections would reconfigure it would reconfigure it would reconfigure it would reconfigure over time as people are learning and a measure of this reconfiguring is called cognitive flexibility it's a capacity to change from one task to another task it can indicate how smart you are the quicker your brain configures an reconfigures its connectivity in response to the changing needs of a task the better it works the better you are at learning new things multitasking or switching between tasks and possibly higher intelligence recent research suggests that general intelligence depends on this dynamic reconfiguration of your main networks but like most research about intelligence it raises even more questions I think there's a lot of components to intelligence and that cognitive flexibility is certainly one that associate with intelligence but I wouldn't I wouldn't say that it necessarily constitutes you know it certainly doesn't explain 100 percent of what intelligence actually is but what we can say is that cognitive flexibility is amazing so is there a way to make my brain more flexible so I can be a super fast learner or a super multitasker a super Tasker how can I reconfigure my brain to be the best level so what we know so far is that people who are very good learners have very changeable networks so their patterns of connectivity change very quickly that change ability of the network is related to how positive somebody feels on a particular day or so even a positive mood and the degree to which they have slept well the night before and had breakfast and I feel that if I sleep well yes if I you will have a more changeable brain network pattern of connections and all the researchers suggest that exercise can boost our cognitive flexibility too they seem like pretty simple takeaways but remember that they've come from analyzing a huge and super complicated map of the human brain so I think what we're doing in neuroscience is trying to say it's not just about single brain regions it's not just about single connections is about it's about the whole pattern which is admitting a high level of complexity but from that we can gain very simple intuitions about what makes a brain network healthy and then what makes it altered in disease and reconfiguring patterns in your brain it takes energy lots of it certain patterns are hard to achieve just like our certain configurations a heart of the human body is to bend and twist into so a lot of times that we fall back on configuration patterns that take the least energy breaking out of those patterns is often the first step in changing the way you think and it can even help unleash your creativity thankfully for me this kind of neural acrobatics is not correlated with my body's flexibility [Music] right hand on hand on blue great is that all right that is your right okay

blue areas and one yellow area and I'm making two connections to two red areas as we play a game we're going to change the connections and as a person learns these connections between brain regions can change they can connect and put apart and connect again so this pattern may be illustrative of the connectivity at one particular point in time but then it would reconfigure to form new connections would reconfigure it would reconfigure it would reconfigure it would reconfigure over time as people are learning and a measure of this reconfiguring is called cognitive flexibility it's a capacity to change from one task to another task it can indicate how smart you are the quicker your brain configures an reconfigures its connectivity in response to the changing needs of a task the better it works the better you are at learning new things multitasking or switching between tasks and possibly higher intelligence recent research suggests that general intelligence depends on this dynamic reconfiguration of your main networks but like most research about intelligence it raises even more questions I think there's a lot of components to intelligence and that cognitive flexibility is certainly one that associate with intelligence but I wouldn't I wouldn't say that it necessarily constitutes you know it certainly doesn't explain 100 percent of what intelligence actually is but what we can say is that cognitive flexibility is amazing so is there a way to make my brain more flexible so I can be a super fast learner or a super multitasker a super Tasker how can I reconfigure my brain to be the best level so what we know so far is that people who are very good learners have very changeable networks so their patterns of connectivity change very quickly that change ability of the network is related to how positive somebody feels on a particular day or so even a positive mood and the degree to which they have slept well the night before and had breakfast and I feel that if I sleep well yes if I you will have a more changeable brain network pattern of connections and all the researchers suggest that exercise can boost our cognitive flexibility too they seem like pretty simple takeaways but remember that they've come from analyzing a huge and super complicated map of the human brain so I think what we're doing in neuroscience is trying to say it's not just about single brain regions it's not just about single connections is about it's about the whole pattern which is admitting a high level of complexity but from that we can gain very simple intuitions about what makes a brain network healthy and then what makes it altered in disease and reconfiguring patterns in your brain it takes energy lots of it certain patterns are hard to achieve just like our certain configurations a heart of the human body is to bend and twist into so a lot of times that we fall back on configuration patterns that take the least energy breaking out of those patterns is often the first step in changing the way you think and it can even help unleash your creativity thankfully for me this kind of neural acrobatics is not correlated with my body's flexibility [Music] right hand on hand on blue great is that all right that is your right okay

**Transcript**:
Every student knows that groggy feeling of struggling to stay awake through first period. The day drags on endlessly... until the final bell sounds. Kids in the US seem to spend more hours in school than other students around the world. But does this idea really hold up? How do students in other countries spend their time, and what can the US learn from them? U.S. students spend more time in K-12 schools than their peers in many other countries A recent study by the Pew Research Center compared 'intended instructional time' among 33 countries including the US. Most US states require their public schools to have between 175 and 180 days of elementary schooling per year, depending on grade level. That translates into an average of 943 hours per year. The only countries where kids spent more time in elementary school each year were: Israel, Australia, Mexico and Chile. In middle school, the average time for US kids jumps up to 1,016 hours. With so much time spent in the classroom, it would seem kids in America should be among the highest achievers. But, that's not the case. In Japan and South Korea, kids spend an average of about 150 instructional hours less per year in school than their peers in the US. And yet, they consistently score higher on international tests. How is that possible? In both countries, competition to attend elite universities is extremely rigorous. It's common for students to get extra help with private tutoring and night classes, known as 'cram schools'. In Japan, 'cram schools' or jukus are offered to kids as young as four years old -- to help get them into private kindergartens. In South Korea, some cram schools stay open as late as 11pm, so high school students can better prepare for college entrance exams. These extra hours aren't counted as time spent in school, but evening classes are a huge part of a student's life. In US schools, kids typically start class early - between 7:30 and 8:00am. But in other countries like Germany and Finland where academic performance is high, school schedules and hours are more flexible. In Germany, the school day starts between 7:30 and 8:15 but finishes around noon or 1pm - a tradition that dates back 250 years. While US kids eat lunch at school and stay in class up to 4pm, in Germany, kids go home for lunch and don't return to school in the afternoon. Instead, they spend two to three hours each
day doing homework. The German school schedule might look appealing to American students, but it was rooted in the idea that mothers would be at home to help take care of the kids. Over the last decade, all-day schools have started to catch on, to match the German economy and working parents' schedules. In Finland, classes start between 8 and 9am and run until about 1 or 2 - with a hot lunch served every day and minimal homework after school. Teachers typically give kids a 15-minute break for every 45-minutes of instruction. Research has shown that frequent breaks keep students 'fresh' and more focused throughout the day. Kids in America may have longer, more rigid school schedules, but at least they can relax during a 10 week long summer break. Across Europe, summer breaks range from six weeks in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK to up to 13 weeks for kids in Italy and Portugal. It's commonly thought that the summer schedule was created to serve the American 'farm economy' so kids could join their families and work the fields. But that's a myth! Kids in rural areas took their breaks during the spring and the fall, when crops were planted, and then harvested and sold. Classes were held during the summer when kids weren't needed as much on the farm. The real reason for summer break? In cities, the summer heat drove kids out
of the sweltering classrooms -- and their families out of town to escape high temperatures. By the late 19th century, school reformers argued for standardization of the calendar across urban and rural areas - resulting in the modern school schedule. Today, across the US, officials are experimenting with all kinds of schedules like year-round classes or four-day weeks with longer hours Monday through Thursday. Over the last decade, enrollment in online schools has tripled - and an estimated two million kids are now being taught at home. Supporters of homeschooling say they can cover the same amount of material in half the time, allowing kids to participate in more extra-curricular activities Virtual classrooms and online technology are driving major changes in education, ones that could impact school schedules in a dramatic way. And that school bell? It might not ring as often -- or as long -- in the future. [MUSIC]

this episode is sponsored by onedrive a subscription service where you can find the answer to everything you've ever wondered about and some things you never imagined you would wonder about head over to onedrive.com scishow for a free trial [Music] this month may 2022 more than 120 confirmed or suspected cases of a rare disease called monkey pox have been reported in countries like portugal spain the uk and the usa this means it is being detected outside its origins in central and western africa and in multiple unrelated places that's something that always gets the attention of public health authorities so what is monkey pox and why is it popping up now here is what we know monkey pox is a disease caused by a virus that is part of what's known as the ortho pox family which are brick or oval-shaped dna viruses the same family as cow pox and smallpox though not chickenpox it typically starts out with flu-like symptoms like fever chills and muscle aches as well as swollen lymph nodes a few days after the fever sets in the patient gets fluid-filled bumps on their skin these tend to be concentrated on the face and extremities including the palms and soles of the feet infections usually last about two to four weeks and there's an incubation period of often around one to two weeks before symptoms appear basically we know that monkeybox isn't a new disease experts have already been studying it for decades and it is a zoonotic disease that's one that is spread from animals to humans it's named monkey pox because it was discovered in research monkeys in the 1950s the natural reservoir is not known but its primary host is probably some sort of african rodent a person might catch it if they get scratched or bitten or if they eat undercooked contaminated meat from there monkey pox can be spread from person to person via contact with contaminated materials like bedding or towels bodily fluids respiratory secretions or the infectious fluid from the sores the first time it was documented in people was in 1970 in the democratic republic of the congo since then when it has cropped up in humans it's usually been in central and west africa mostly in rural rainforested regions however cases have been rising over the past couple of decades since 2017 there's been a particularly large ongoing outbreak in nigeria for instance and we've seen some travel related cases outside of africa in 2003 there was an outbreak in the u.s related to pet prairie dogs and imported exotic animals we don't know for sure why outbreaks are becoming more frequent it might be related to people coming into more contact with animals due to changing circumstances and habitat loss but it may also actually have to do with the death of smallpox because the smallpox vaccine can prevent monkey pox infection remember that smallpox and monkeypox are in the same viral family and up until around 40 years ago getting a smallpox vaccine was common but the disease in a marvelous feat of humanity was declared extinct in 1980 and since then vaccinations have mostly stopped today only around 30 of the people in the world have been vaccinated against smallpox that means over time as smallpox immunity waned monkeypox may have gained more opportunities to infect unprotected people in fact most of the people who've been infected were not vaccinated for smallpox so that's the run-up but what about the current outbreak that has appeared in europe and elsewhere outside of africa unfortunately some of this attention is just because like let's be honest infections are spreading to places that aren't africa but it's also a genuine concern because it's unusual to see it pop up in so many different places at once the first case was identified in may of 2022 and involved someone who had traveled to nigeria which is not unheard of but since then other cases have been identified where people hadn't traveled to endemic countries and exactly where or how they became infected isn't clear yet this suggests that there may have been either community or person-to-person transmission community transmission is when there isn't a clear contact point with someone who is infected and contagious and monkey pox lends itself to this since it can be spread via contaminated bedding towels toothbrushes or other not human contacts person-to-person transmission is of course like what it sounds like contact with an infected and contagious person spreads it to another person and this has been seen with monkey pox but outside of the places where the virus is endemic person-to-person transmission has only been documented once before and this spread outside its usual range is basically the big reason this is getting so much attention many of the current cases have been in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men however that could actually be a confounding factor not a clue that's because monkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection it does spread through close contact and sex certainly qualifies so some experts have speculated that could be aiding transmission but it's also likely that monkey pox is simply being spread in environments these people are congregating in and due to the history of hiv and aids they might just be a community more likely to notice infectious disease early that is why it's important for us to learn more about how this virus is spreading so that we can be sure we're catching all of the communities affected as for how deadly this outbreak is a draft of the current outbreak's genome has already been sequenced and it looks like it's related to the west african strain of the disease which has a fatality rate in endemic countries of about one percent and this is great news because the other option is a variant whose fatality rate is closer to 10 however that number may also not be applicable since the non-african countries it's popping up in have more medical resources at their disposal than the countries it is endemic to there haven't been any reported deaths in the u.s or europe yet and the good news is that vaccines and treatments do exist for smallpox like i said earlier smallpox vaccines provide some protection against monkeypox in fact they can even be given up to four days after exposure to monkeypox in what the experts call post-exposure prophylaxis antiviral drugs developed for smallpox are also effective of course once again this is an equity problem resource-rich nations like the us have stockpiles of smallpox vaccine that can be used to treat outbreaks while in central and west africa monkeypox is not quite business as usual but also not new indeed some african doctors have pinned their struggle to manage monkey box outbreaks on a lack of access to vaccines and treatments so to recap monkey pox is a disease we have known about for decades it's usually rare and crops up in rural rainforest regions of certain african countries but has become more frequent over the past couple decades maybe as a result of waning smallpox immunity now there is an outbreak outside of the countries we would normally expect in higher numbers than we'd expect a lot more investigation needs to be done to determine why and how it seems to be spreading more easily than it has in the past however treatments do exist and unlike most emerging infectious diseases we are not forced to start from scratch and of course we will update you if the situation gets worse so stay tuned and thanks for watching if you just learned something new about monkey pox you might not be surprised that there is a lot to learn and also correct from our previous understandings about other diseases like the black death like you might have thought that you knew all about the black death but scientists discovered that it was so deadly and fast spreading thanks to a bacterial mutation that happened a hundred years before the plague even got to europe those are the kind of new insights you can learn about from

the uk and the usa this means it is being detected outside its origins in central and western africa and in multiple unrelated places that's something that always gets the attention of public health authorities so what is monkey pox and why is it popping up now here is what we know monkey pox is a disease caused by a virus that is part of what's known as the ortho pox family which are brick or oval-shaped dna viruses the same family as cow pox and smallpox though not chickenpox it typically starts out with flu-like symptoms like fever chills and muscle aches as well as swollen lymph nodes a few days after the fever sets in the patient gets fluid-filled bumps on their skin these tend to be concentrated on the face and extremities including the palms and soles of the feet infections usually last about two to four weeks and there's an incubation period of often around one to two weeks before symptoms appear basically we know that monkeybox isn't a new disease experts have already been studying it for decades and it is a zoonotic disease that's one that is spread from animals to humans it's named monkey pox because it was discovered in research monkeys in the 1950s the natural reservoir is not known but its primary host is probably some sort of african rodent a person might catch it if they get scratched or bitten or if they eat undercooked contaminated meat from there monkey pox can be spread from person to person via contact with contaminated materials like bedding or towels bodily fluids respiratory secretions or the infectious fluid from the sores the first time it was documented in people was in 1970 in the democratic republic of the congo since then when it has cropped up in humans it's usually been in central and west africa mostly in rural rainforested regions however cases have been rising over the past couple of decades since 2017 there's been a particularly large ongoing outbreak in nigeria for instance and we've seen some travel related cases outside of africa in 2003 there was an outbreak in the u.s related to pet prairie dogs and imported exotic animals we don't know for sure why outbreaks are becoming more frequent it might be related to people coming into more contact with animals due to changing circumstances and habitat loss but it may also actually have to do with the death of smallpox because the smallpox vaccine can prevent monkey pox infection remember that smallpox and monkeypox are in the same viral family and up until around 40 years ago getting a smallpox vaccine was common but the disease in a marvelous feat of humanity was declared extinct in 1980 and since then vaccinations have mostly stopped today only around 30 of the people in the world have been vaccinated against smallpox that means over time as smallpox immunity waned monkeypox may have gained more opportunities to infect unprotected people in fact most of the people who've been infected were not vaccinated for smallpox so that's the run-up but what about the current outbreak that has appeared in europe and elsewhere outside of africa unfortunately some of this attention is just because like let's be honest infections are spreading to places that aren't africa but it's also a genuine concern because it's unusual to see it pop up in so many different places at once the first case was identified in may of 2022 and involved someone who had traveled to nigeria which is not unheard of but since then other cases have been identified where people hadn't traveled to endemic countries and exactly where or how they became infected isn't clear yet this suggests that there may have been either community or person-to-person transmission community transmission is when there isn't a clear contact point with someone who is infected and contagious and monkey pox lends itself to this since it can be spread via contaminated bedding towels toothbrushes or other not human contacts person-to-person transmission is of course like what it sounds like contact with an infected and contagious person spreads it to another person and this has been seen with monkey pox but outside of the places where the virus is endemic person-to-person transmission has only been documented once before and this spread outside its usual range is basically the big reason this is getting so much attention many of the current cases have been in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men however that could actually be a confounding factor not a clue that's because monkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection it does spread through close contact and sex certainly qualifies so some experts have speculated that could be aiding transmission but it's also likely that monkey pox is simply being spread in environments these people are congregating in and due to the history of hiv and aids they might just be a community more likely to notice infectious disease early that is why it's important for us to learn more about how this virus is spreading so that we can be sure we're catching all of the communities affected as for how deadly this outbreak is a draft of the current outbreak's genome has already been sequenced and it looks like it's related to the west african strain of the disease which has a fatality rate in endemic countries of about one percent and this is great news because the other option is a variant whose fatality rate is closer to 10 however that number may also not be applicable since the non-african countries it's popping up in have more medical resources at their disposal than the countries it is endemic to there haven't been any reported deaths in the u.s or europe yet and the good news is that vaccines and treatments do exist for smallpox like i said earlier smallpox vaccines provide some protection against monkeypox in fact they can even be given up to four days after exposure to monkeypox in what the experts call post-exposure prophylaxis antiviral drugs developed for smallpox are also effective of course once again this is an equity problem resource-rich nations like the us have stockpiles of smallpox vaccine that can be used to treat outbreaks while in central and west africa monkeypox is not quite business as usual but also not new indeed some african doctors have pinned their struggle to manage monkey box outbreaks on a lack of access to vaccines and treatments so to recap monkey pox is a disease we have known about for decades it's usually rare and crops up in rural rainforest regions of certain african countries but has become more frequent over the past couple decades maybe as a result of waning smallpox immunity now there is an outbreak outside of the countries we would normally expect in higher numbers than we'd expect a lot more investigation needs to be done to determine why and how it seems to be spreading more easily than it has in the past however treatments do exist and unlike most emerging infectious diseases we are not forced to start from

**Transcript**:
this episode is sponsored by onedrive a subscription service where you can find the answer to everything you've ever wondered about and some things you never imagined you would wonder about head over to onedrive.com scishow for a free trial [Music] this month may 2022 more than 120 confirmed or suspected cases of a rare disease called monkey pox have been reported in countries like portugal spain the uk and the usa this means it is being detected outside its origins in central and western africa and in multiple unrelated places that's something that always gets the attention of public health authorities so what is monkey pox and why is it popping up now here is what we know monkey pox is a disease caused by a virus that is part of what's known as the ortho pox family which are brick or oval-shaped dna viruses the same family as cow pox and smallpox though not chickenpox it typically starts out with flu-like symptoms like fever chills and muscle aches as well as swollen lymph nodes a few days after the fever sets in the patient gets fluid-filled bumps on their skin these tend to be concentrated on the face and extremities including the palms and soles of the feet infections usually last about two to four weeks and there's an incubation period of often around one to two weeks before symptoms appear basically we know that monkeybox isn't a new disease experts have already been studying it for decades and it is a zoonotic disease that's one that is spread from animals to humans it's named monkey pox because it was discovered in research monkeys in the 1950s the natural reservoir is not known but its primary host is probably some sort of african rodent a person might catch it if they get scratched or bitten or if they eat undercooked contaminated meat from there monkey pox can be spread from person to person via contact with contaminated materials like bedding or towels bodily fluids respiratory secretions or the infectious fluid from the sores the first time it was documented in people was in 1970 in the democratic republic of the congo since then when it has cropped up in humans it's usually been in central and west africa mostly in rural rainforested regions however cases have been rising over the past couple of decades since 2017 there's been a particularly large ongoing outbreak in nigeria for instance and we've seen some travel related cases outside of africa in 2003 there was an outbreak in the u.s related to pet prairie dogs and imported exotic animals we don't know for sure why outbreaks are becoming more frequent it might be related to people coming into more contact with animals due to changing circumstances and habitat loss but it may also actually have to do with the death of smallpox because the smallpox vaccine can prevent monkey pox infection remember that smallpox and monkeypox are in the same viral family and up until around 40 years ago getting a smallpox vaccine was common but the disease in a marvelous feat of humanity was declared extinct in 1980 and since then vaccinations have mostly stopped today only around 30 of the people in the world have been vaccinated against smallpox that means over time as smallpox immunity waned monkeypox may have gained more opportunities to infect unprotected people in fact most of the people who've been infected were not vaccinated for smallpox so that's the run-up but what about the current outbreak that has appeared in europe and elsewhere outside of africa unfortunately some of this attention is just because like let's be honest infections are spreading to places that aren't africa but it's also a genuine concern because it's unusual to see it pop up in so many different places at once the first case was identified in may of 2022 and involved someone who had traveled to nigeria which is not unheard of but since then other cases have been identified where people hadn't traveled to endemic countries and exactly where or how they became infected isn't clear yet this suggests that there may have been either community or person-to-person transmission community transmission is when there isn't a clear contact point with someone who is infected and contagious and monkey pox lends itself to this since it can be spread via contaminated bedding towels toothbrushes or other not human contacts person-to-person transmission is of course like what it sounds like contact with an infected and contagious person spreads it to another person and this has been seen with monkey pox but outside of the places where the virus is endemic person-to-person transmission has only been documented once before and this spread outside its usual range is basically the big reason this is getting so much attention many of the current cases have been in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men however that could actually be a confounding factor not a clue that's because monkeypox is not considered a sexually transmitted infection it does spread through close contact and sex certainly qualifies so some experts have speculated that could be aiding transmission but it's also likely that monkey pox is simply being spread in environments these people are congregating in and due to the history of hiv and aids they might just be a community more likely to notice infectious disease early that is why it's important for us to learn more about how this virus is spreading so that we can be sure we're catching all of the communities affected as for how deadly this outbreak is a draft of the current outbreak's genome has already been sequenced and it looks like it's related to the west african strain of the disease which has a fatality rate in endemic countries of about one percent and this is great news because the other option is a variant whose fatality rate is closer to 10 however that number may also not be applicable since the non-african countries it's popping up in have more medical resources at their disposal than the countries it is endemic to there haven't been any reported deaths in the u.s or europe yet and the good news is that vaccines and treatments do exist for smallpox like i said earlier smallpox vaccines provide some protection against monkeypox in fact they can even be given up to four days after exposure to monkeypox in what the experts call post-exposure prophylaxis antiviral drugs developed for smallpox are also effective of course once again this is an equity problem resource-rich nations like the us have stockpiles of smallpox vaccine that can be used to treat outbreaks while in central and west africa monkeypox is not quite business as usual but also not new indeed some african doctors have pinned their struggle to manage monkey box outbreaks on a lack of access to vaccines and treatments so to recap monkey pox is a disease we have known about for decades it's usually rare and crops up in rural rainforest regions of certain african countries but has become more frequent over the past couple decades maybe as a result of waning smallpox immunity now there is an outbreak outside of the countries we would normally expect in higher numbers than we'd expect a lot more investigation needs to be done to determine why and how it seems to be spreading more easily than it has in the past however treatments do exist and unlike most emerging infectious diseases we are not forced to start from scratch and of course we will update you if the situation gets worse so stay tuned and thanks for watching if you just learned something new about monkey pox you might not be surprised that there is a lot to learn and also correct from our previous understandings about other diseases like the black death like you might have thought that you knew all about the black death but scientists discovered that it was so deadly and fast spreading thanks to a bacterial mutation that happened a hundred years before the plague even got to europe those are the kind of new insights you can learn about from

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

**Transcript**:
[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done.

The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}"no intent filter" [alright] "because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates." So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area.

For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.

**Transcript**:
when the French BNP paribas Bank Foundation asked if they could pay me to make a video that promotes the research that they fund and to climate change in coral reefs I was interested when they then said that they've given me a camera crew and fly me out to a tropical island paradise to go filming in the reefs strangely enough I said yes [Music] tropical reefs like tropical rainforests are found in a belt all around the equator the most famous is the Great Barrier Reef but there's also another surrounding a group of volcanic islands in the middle of the Pacific and I'm on this island Maria [Music] coral reefs are the tropical rainforests of the sea they are super biodiverse ecosystems in fact by some measures they are the most biodiverse ecosystem on the planet a cover less than 1% of the seafloor and yet a home to 25% of all marine life and this biodiversity benefits humans coral reefs can reduce the energy in the waves by up to 97% protecting 200 million people around the world from coastal flooding and hurricanes 1 billion people that's one in seven of the world's population have some dependence on the reefs for food in fishing adding in the benefits from tourism and new medicines it's estimated that coral reefs benefit the global economy by 30 billion dollars each year now as I'm sure you've heard in the news time time again coral reefs are under threat they're bleaching they're dying they're going to go extinct mister by 2050 and short or reversing global warming there's nothing we can do about it but the trouble is that's not quite true and it turns out that coral reefs aren't quite as doomed as we've been led to believe corals are weird animals although they look like rocky plants they're actually an animal and an algae in an interdependent relationship so I headed to the Korea Research Center to chat to coral expert dr. Leticia headway to find out more but what is this yeah and so what we do here is that we can look really in detail yeah look like every time you see like a small 10sec yes a different product oh yeah with a little tentacle yeah it's alive it isn't you even tell me it's alive it is alive so can we zoom in quite on one of these polyps so if you look closer like you can see how your turns occur like it's full of drowned out yeah it's not a solid brown yeah it's like a sampling so this is something that provides okay so the the algae the zoo's anthalie is brown yeah and that's photosynthesizing yeah so that'll give the sugar to the animal yep what does the polyp give to the algae so we provide like a shelter and Angie also use some waste of the garage I do okay so it's really what we call our music symbiosis now it's an exchange between boss organism and it's beneficial for both of them so you can probably say that this is an animal with a plant inside of it yeah you can see it all on this massive it's what calcium carbonate yeah yeah that's really cool first the corn you would start just with one product okay so there are we will swim in the water and at some point to find a good spot to set up yeah be just set up and they start building the skeleton so first you start with one per deep and then the curl will grow and the product will divide divide divide and then you have thousands of products that compose one coral colony so it is just one one polyp will then divide asexually yeah so that it's like each polyp is almost like the cells in our body yeah making up the whole except that each polyp has its own set of cells yeah so it's like a level above what humans say yeah it's very an amazing anyway yeah that you did I mean now you have convinced no because when you go to a coral reef you think oh look at the lovely fish look at the sharks look at the Rays and the whales and like oh there happens to be some coral in the background so no I'm sure that when you will die you will look at look at current defenses I think I will this is a great thank you speaking of diving you may not know that I'm actually a qualified scuba diver so PhD student nina here offered to teach me about fish and corals by taking me out diving look how happy she looks about this I on the other hand hadn't died in the ten years since qualifying so needless to say I was a bit apprehensive I say here that I'm feeling okay I was not feeling okay what's the problem what's her troops wearing our precious reefs Venus the biggest global problem is definitely temperature rise if you imagine global change in the air the oceans are absorbing a more a lot more heat than the air so the effect is bigger in in the oceans but on their on the reefs a little bit of temperature rise already affects them you have the algae living inside corals yeah they get yeah they get expelled when when they get too stressed and what actually causes the bleaching because you've got this animal with a symbiotic relationship with this is anthalie algae yeah why when it gets hot did they get rid of the algae there you have the algae inside living inside the corals and when it gets warm they start to behave differently and the corals don't like it so the they actually expel coral is an animal yeah and they expel the algae and if it doesn't like then and then the coral becomes white but it's not that yet it just doesn't have the algae but if the algae don't come back he's gonna starve so it's gonna die eventually but if it's if this is short and the coral is just wide enough that it can recover if the algae come back in time but if the heating for example takes too much time it won't recover and it will starve and die and so on or else you're gonna over grow the dead coral and I dismiss so white coral isn't necessarily dead coral no like very clean white coral is not that yet now on a global scale the problem is we had a massive bleaching event in 2016 but now in 2007 there was a second one so the reef is recovering at some place you see this small recruits then they get bleached again so like if it's gonna continue like this there's no way some of the important corals are gonna recover if bleached corals are not dead corals and in fact corals can recover from bleaching well why are we so worried about bleaching events let's hit the beach the problem with coral bleaching events isn't so much the severity I mean don't get me wrong the severity is bad but is the frequency that's been changing in the last few years there's been causing the problems so let's draw a graph on the x-axis we've got time and on the y-axis we've got the percentage of healthy coral cover so naturally before a bleaching event the coral will be at 100% healthy cover then 1998 was the first time we had ever seen a mass global horribly chin event before they've been just localized to Sun reefs but this was the first time it was all over the world and so the healthy coral cover dropped but what many people don't realize about these events is that corals can recover and give them about ten years or so and the corals will come back to the same species richness the same number of species as they had the thought and so the coral comes back to normal but then in 2010 there was another El Nino another mass bleaching event and once again the coral cover stopped it but once again the coral started to grow back and everything was going fine until then in 2015 just five years after the 2010 event there was another mass event and then 2016 was the worst world had ever seen which saw some reefs going down to 90% of the coral was bleached 2017 we had another bleaching event and so it's not these corals can't recover if given the time they're just not getting the time they need to come back to normal the only way that we can stop these coral bleaching events from occurring is to reverse global climate change which is going to be difficult what we can do is change how fast the corals bounce back whether they can recover quickly whether they recover slowly all right now they don't recover at all how fast the corals can recover and get back to their normal state that is called resilience it turns out we're able to change how resilient the reefs are for example by changing how we fish which is exactly what Nina is studying and I promise that this time you get to see me go scuba diving we're gonna look at the role of fishes and how climate change affects how the roles of the fishes changed as well so basically we're gonna try to quantify why fish matter on the reef why do you fish matter yeah a lot of reasons so we have ecosystem processes and ecosystem services ecosystem processes are like how much do the herbivores eat so how much algae can they take up to sustain the reef then you have ecosystem services like biomass production for fishing or the composition of nutrients inside the fish for further humans when there's a coral bleaching or massive die-off you have these fields of dead corals covered that are getting covered in algae but then if the fish quickly start to target all the algae that are growing on corals they can recover more easily than if there's reproduction off girls like the tiny baby corals they can find a place to settle they clean all of the nasty dead stuff yeah they clean the dead reef the fish are changing how easy it is for the coral to recover from a bleaching event yes so they're really important there are really important yeah and a day I'm assuming that there are some that are more important than others that you have your keystone species well we already know that parrotfish and surgeon fish are important for the herbivory part huh because yeah that's those are the guys and I'm gonna eat the turf algae and keep the keep the algae short enough for the reef to recover more easily cool right when I knew that I was coming to Polynesia the only thing I had to do whilst I was there was go scuba diving on the reefs when the time came though I was terrified the combination of being on camera fear of seasickness everyone around me giving instructions in French and that I hadn't dived in 10 years I'd never dived in the open sea and had never died from a boat that's all that was going through my head at this point [Music] [Music] okay we're not gonna be able to speak underwater yeah we need to work out a way of communicating okay what this is a coral that's covered in turf algae okay that's gonna turn gray parrot fish okay parrotfish [Music] joy shark [Music] oh my goodness oh this is so much going on to think about the same time good obviously the scuba-diving side of thing is good sure having never typed in the middle of the season fours but then also there's so many corals fish two species of shark lemon shark and the black tip reef shark and it's just we're just saying yeah how healthy the corals eyes incredible compared to what leavened I mean it's just as far as you can see everything is covered in healthy coral that's hardly any algae a few bleached ones but really not that many and just so many colors as well just one note algae are not always bad yes they're part of the national system also yeah just when dlg take over exactly yeah but yeah it was nice there were love life corals I was impressed yeah oh so much to take it ones is there anything that we can do then to help the reefs out when it comes to if we are fishing and that's gonna change the ecosystem of the reason is there something we can do to not affect very so badly yes we can change fisheries try to change fisheries try to influence the local people try to influence the big economic fisheries to not target the key species yeah and also try to not change the size structure of fish that we used to have a lot of a lot more bigger fish and our basically fishing down the food webs so we're removing the big ones because if you have the same biomass or big fish and the same biomass of small fish same species the roles on the reef are gonna change drastically for example if we go to the bio roading parrotfish fish 50 centimeter can remove 30 times more than a fish of 25 centimeters for example so that's massive so doubling in size produces 30 times more yes have every yeah that's a play in this particularly is that one species yes fishing isn't the only way we can change a reefs resilience we can also change the resilience of the corals themselves one of Leticia's experiments is to break off fragments of corals that have survived a bleaching and grow them up like plant cuttings in a coral garden for three years as she's about to show me we have three different genera of coral when akrura want varieties and one proceed abrupt so you took a coral you broke it Brooks about piece and right now what on the one line you can see that several clone that are left from that colony but generally you can see for some colony a huge variability in the size that they have some a very big and the other one is very small like three four or five times bigger like not a small difference in size or one property yeah big in another really small it's the same coral that you split up at the same time you're growing it in the same place but there's so different yeah it was very surprising we thought we had grown and all the clone of the same colony would behave the same way with time and we will see difference in the crowd and we think that it depends from where the fragment of the colony were collected why would the coral from one part of the animal behave so differently to another part of it is the same car it's the same animal yeah nobody it's genetically the same but we know that the community of Xanterra in coral could change depending of whether or not they have they receive a height impact from the light if it's on the top or it's kind of shadow when it's at the bottom so that could play a key role on the same uranium community and because the same uranium drj provides energy perhaps some of betters of Xanterra from growing than the other one so that's one of the hybrid is also you've got some bits will have been broken off from shady parts of the corals some from really sunny parts and that will then change how they then go on to grow that could that's so interesting so here you've got two different experiments going on yeah you've got you're taking a colony you're splitting it up into clothes yeah and then you're observing it as the natural stressors happen yeah and then you've also got your selective breeding which is like modern farming technique produces the most milk yeah how do you go about selectively breeding a coral what we do is that we bring back piece of coral at the crib in the laboratory and so and then every every every night we're gonna watch man starting from 8:00 p.m. to midnight because we spawn at night we collect directly the package from each colony and then we separate them and then we we have eggs and sperm from different colonies and then what we do is that we kind of do like we can mix together in some little tube or stuff like that and so we can release array which hex will go with which pair what is it you're actually looking for like which more how do you know the coral has passed the test and that's the one that you're gonna continue it so yeah right now the past test was whether you were able to resist to temperature or not in the past so that was really whether they were resistant or not to temperature and we will mix eggs and spam from Weiner colony and see whether we can get winner lovely so the idea is trying to restore area with code that will be able to face the increase of sea water temperature and with all this information is the ultimate goal to be able to repopulate wild reefs with corals that you know to be resilient yeah that's the big idea but just to be realistic we won't be able to restore for example all the reef in Moorea so the idea is more to restore like some area some small area that would kind of hacked as a source of lava and that will be able then to kind of naturally colonize other over reef as long as the small part is yeah yeah yeah oh for the reefs here in Moorea seem to be faring a lot better than the reefs elsewhere in the world although that probably says a lot more about how bad things are in the rest of the world than how good things are here let's face it global warming is the number one threat to coral reefs and fixing global warming as soon as possible should be our number one priority but it has been really interesting to hear that there are some things that we can do to help the reefs before we fully fixed global warming before we've eradicated bleaching events by improving the coral reefs resilience whether that's not fishing the largest parrot fish so that bleached corals have time to recover before they're covered in algae or whether that's researching what makes individual corals more resistant to bleaching so that we can breed those and repopulate dead reefs with those all of the scientists I've spoken to here said that they don't think that coral reefs are going to go extinct by 2050 but they might become a shadow of their former selves a less diverse a less complex ecosystem and so it's time that we appreciate how lucky we are to have reefs right now and by right now I mean right now so if you don't mind I'm going for it [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you

**Transcript**:
This is you. And these are your ancestors, a huge pyramid
stretching into the past and balancing right on your head. How many ancestors do you have? Well, you have two parents. Four grandparents. And eight great-grandparents. Four generations back, your direct ancestors
total 30. If we continue down this line, doubling every
step, just 40 generations ago we’d find a trillion ancestors, all living *at the same
time*. Which is… ridiculous. That’s not only more people than have ever
been alive, it’s more stars than are in the Milky Way. Since our species came on the scene 200,000
years ago, there’ve been maybe 7 or 8 *thousand* generations of humans leading up to… you. So where are all your missing ancestors? Clearly, there’s been some inbreeding. [OPEN] We’re not talking banjo-playing, King-of-Spain,
Cersei-Jamie inbreeding, but every family tree inevitably grows forks. Before Tinder, choices for mates were
often limited to as far as you could walk. Even people like Charles Darwin and Albert
Einstein married their first cousins. Because so many people with shared ancestors
have reproduced, our number of actual ancestors is much smaller than what simple math tells
us. If we replace that with fancy math, factoring
in how people moved and lived and paired up… life expectancy, trade, geography, Genghis
Khan… we find something interesting: every human alive today shares a common ancestor
in their family tree, and this person lived only around 3,000 years ago. That’s right, next time you get in a fight
with a stranger on the internet, just remember that you share the same great great great
great great (fast foward) great grandfather or grandmother. But we don’t know who that person was. The math tells us they must have existed,
but they didn’t leave fossils or artifacts. Or like, a note or something. Though, writing birthday cards for each of
their 7.4 Billion great great great great great (fast forward) great grandchildren would
have been nice gesture. But we all carry a record of our ancestors
in our genes. Because DNA is copied over and over, every
so often a mistake is written in. You know how when you make a copy of a copy,
it’s doesn't come out as sharp? Like that, but since most of our DNA can be
changed without affecting how things work, many of these mutations slip through to the
next generation. These genetic changes accumulate at a steady
rate through time, so scientists can read them like a molecular clock, and estimate
how much time has passed. And which changes individuals share tell us
how closely or distantly related they are. Humans *seem* really different, but on a DNA
level we’re remarkably similar. Groups of chimps in Central Africa, living
right next to each other, show more genetic variation than we find in the entire human
population. This genetic similarity tells us that our
species is new, in the big scheme of things, and that at one point our population was small,
maybe as few as 10,000 of us. To put that in perspective, that’s only
a third of your average Bruce Springsteen crowd. Sorry Boss. Today, any two humans only differ by about
1 out of 1000 DNA base pairs. But our genome is so big, that’s still millions
of single letter differences, or SNPs, for “single nucleotide polymorphism”. We tend to see combinations of these changes,
chunks of SNPs, associated with different geographic locations. Companies that test your DNA ancestry read
thousands of these single letter changes in your genome, to make a sort of signature of
your unique genetic variation. Then they compare your signature to thousands
of reference individuals from various parts of the world, and do a bunch of fancy math
to see which parts of your genome most likely came from certain geographic areas. My genetic results: Pretty much look like
this. My ancNewsprestors, on both sides of my family,
are from Northern Europe and Scandinavia, which explains my last name, why I’m tall,
why I don’t tan, and also why I carry more Neanderthal DNA than 2/3rds of people. Confused why I have Neanderthal DNA? You should watch our last video. I didn’t
find any surprises, but many people learn about ancestry they didn’t know they had. Where we come from isn’t always obvious
on the outside, but DNA doesn’t lie. Before, using math, we identified an ancestor,
not too long ago, that’s related to all of us. But that person’s genetic influence has
been shuffled so much it’s invisible in our DNA today. Is there someone whose genes have been passed
on, unbroken, to today? Some leftover fingerprint from the mother
of everyone alive? There is. You have a 47th chromosome. It lives in mitochondria, the POWERHOUSE OF
THE CELL! – so we’re doing that again? Ok–mitochondria used to be free-swimming. They have their own genetic material. Unlike your other 46 chromosomes, there’s
no shuffling when it’s passed between generations. What’s more, all your mitochondria came
from your mother’s egg, not your father’s sperm. They trace an unbroken line of ancestors stretching
back through every female in your family tree. By comparing the changes that have accumulated
over the millennia, we find the most ancient human mitochondrial DNA comes from Africa,
where our species originated. We can even trace it back to one woman, about
150,000 years ago. Other Homo sapiens females lived alongside
her, but only her lineage lives on today, all other Homo sapiens lineages are extinct. This is mitochondrial Eve. And every single one of us, descend from her. In the truest sense, we really are family. Even if we’re just hundredth cousins or
something. But our ancestry isn’t just branches stretching
into the past, it’s also a tree that extends into the future. Today we have more power to mold that future,
down to the genetic level, than we’ve ever had before. So what might our species’ future look like? Next time. Stay curious. This video is part of a special series we’re
doing about the story of our species: Where we came from, how we’re all connected, and
where we’re going. If you haven’t already, check out part 1
and 2 to trace the fossils in our family tree and learn why we’re the only humans left. And be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is you. And these are your ancestors, a huge pyramid
stretching into the past and balancing right on your head. How many ancestors do you have? Well, you have two parents. Four grandparents. And eight great-grandparents. Four generations back, your direct ancestors
total 30. If we continue down this line, doubling every
step, just 40 generations ago we’d find a trillion ancestors, all living *at the same
time*. Which is… ridiculous. That’s not only more people than have ever
been alive, it’s more stars than are in the Milky Way. Since our species came on the scene 200,000
years ago, there’ve been maybe 7 or 8 *thousand* generations of humans leading up to… you. So where are all your missing ancestors? Clearly, there’s been some inbreeding. [OPEN] We’re not talking banjo-playing, King-of-Spain,
Cersei-Jamie inbreeding, but every family tree inevitably grows forks. Before Tinder, choices for mates were
often limited to as far as you could walk. Even people like Charles Darwin and Albert
Einstein married their first cousins. Because so many people with shared ancestors
have reproduced, our number of actual ancestors is much smaller than what simple math tells
us. If we replace that with fancy math, factoring
in how people moved and lived and paired up… life expectancy, trade, geography, Genghis
Khan… we find something interesting: every human alive today shares a common ancestor
in their family tree, and this person lived only around 3,000 years ago. That’s right, next time you get in a fight
with a stranger on the internet, just remember that you share the same great great great
great great (fast foward) great grandfather or grandmother. But we don’t know who that person was. The math tells us they must have existed,
but they didn’t leave fossils or artifacts. Or like, a note or something. Though, writing birthday cards for each of
their 7.4 Billion great great great great great (fast forward) great grandchildren would
have been nice gesture. But we all carry a record of our ancestors
in our genes. Because DNA is copied over and over, every
so often a mistake is written in. You know how when you make a copy of a copy,
it’s doesn't come out as sharp? Like that, but since most of our DNA can be
changed without affecting how things work, many of these mutations slip through to the
next generation. These genetic changes accumulate at a steady
rate through time, so scientists can read them like a molecular clock, and estimate
how much time has passed. And which changes individuals share tell us
how closely or distantly related they are. Humans *seem* really different, but on a DNA
level we’re remarkably similar. Groups of chimps in Central Africa, living
right next to each other, show more genetic variation than we find in the entire human
population. This genetic similarity tells us that our
species is new, in the big scheme of things, and that at one point our population was small,
maybe as few as 10,000 of us. To put that in perspective, that’s only
a third of your average Bruce Springsteen crowd. Sorry Boss. Today, any two humans only differ by about
1 out of 1000 DNA base pairs. But our genome is so big, that’s still millions
of single letter differences, or SNPs, for “single nucleotide polymorphism”. We tend to see combinations of these changes,
chunks of SNPs, associated with different geographic locations. Companies that test your DNA ancestry read
thousands of these single letter changes in your genome, to make a sort of signature of
your unique genetic variation. Then they compare your signature to thousands
of reference individuals from various parts of the world, and do a bunch of fancy math
to see which parts of your genome most likely came from certain geographic areas. My genetic results: Pretty much look like
this. My ancNewsprestors, on both sides of my family,
are from Northern Europe and Scandinavia, which explains my last name, why I’m tall,
why I don’t tan, and also why I carry more Neanderthal DNA than 2/3rds of people. Confused why I have Neanderthal DNA? You should watch our last video. I didn’t
find any surprises, but many people learn about ancestry they didn’t know they had. Where we come from isn’t always obvious
on the outside, but DNA doesn’t lie. Before, using math, we identified an ancestor,
not too long ago, that’s related to all of us. But that person’s genetic influence has
been shuffled so much it’s invisible in our DNA today. Is there someone whose genes have been passed
on, unbroken, to today? Some leftover fingerprint from the mother
of everyone alive? There is. You have a 47th chromosome. It lives in mitochondria, the POWERHOUSE OF
THE CELL! – so we’re doing that again? Ok–mitochondria used to be free-swimming. They have their own genetic material. Unlike your other 46 chromosomes, there’s
no shuffling when it’s passed between generations. What’s more, all your mitochondria came
from your mother’s egg, not your father’s sperm. They trace an unbroken line of ancestors stretching
back through every female in your family tree. By comparing the changes that have accumulated
over the millennia, we find the most ancient human mitochondrial DNA comes from Africa,
where our species originated. We can even trace it back to one woman, about
150,000 years ago. Other Homo sapiens females lived alongside
her, but only her lineage lives on today, all other Homo sapiens lineages are extinct. This is mitochondrial Eve. And every single one of us, descend from her. In the truest sense, we really are family. Even if we’re just hundredth cousins or
something. But our ancestry isn’t just branches stretching
into the past, it’s also a tree that extends into the future. Today we have more power to mold that future,
down to the genetic level, than we’ve ever had before. So what might our species’ future look like? Next time. Stay curious. This video is part of a special series we’re
doing about the story of our species: Where we came from, how we’re all connected, and
where we’re going. If you haven’t already, check out part 1
and 2 to trace the fossils in our family tree and learn why we’re the only humans left. And be sure to subscribe so you don’t miss

**Transcript**:
So I need you to answer a question – you
only have five seconds to respond and you can have as many answers as you like… Ready? How many uses can you think of for this brick? This is an alternative uses test, they’re
used to measure creative thinking and how flexible people are in approaching a task. Here’s one of the tests I prepared earlier… “Yeah, you could um, you could make very
interesting cookie patterns, I guess?” “You could use it as you would a domino
in a rube goldberg machine” “You could put it in a tin can and make
a rattle out of it” Where creativity comes from has mystified
us for centuries. Throughout history, we believed that creativity
was rare and seen in a small elite: professional painters, poets, performers, and musicians. For a long time, creativity was an enigma,
beyond the reach of science. But today, we know that it takes creativity
to solve problems, it’s an aspect of human intelligence. We find creativity in architecture, science,
engineering and even in nature. Creativity is everywhere! And in the past few decades, there have been
dozens of studies exploring it using brain imaging technology. We’ve found you don’t just use the left
or right hemisphere of your brain when you’re thinking creatively. There isn’t one single brain area or circuit
for creativity – professional artists suffering from damage to different brain regions continue
to produce art showing similar creativity. Over forty different areas of the brain are
likely involved with creativity. I could list them all for you, but your mind
might start to wander... Which might be a good thing! Humans spend an average of 30% of our day
engaged in "mind-wandering." A lot of these studies say that mind wandering
helps get our creativity flowing. But… why? How can we not pay attention and manage to
hit on an idea that’s just right? Some scientists think that mind-wandering
might distract you from your perceived obstacles or it may allow your subconscious to keep
working on the problem without your higher cognitive functions getting involved. Mind wandering may also promote your brain's
ability to restructure the way you look at a problem, perhaps you’ll make connections
between two seemingly unrelated things and come up with novel, creative solutions. “Oh! You could melt it and then pour it into a
mould and sculpt something else out of it!” Ok, so everyone's mind wanders. Then why aren't we all creative geniuses? Well, our biology may play a part too: In
one study, families who collectively scored higher on musical aptitude and creativity
tests were more likely to have an extra copy of “the glucose mu-ta-ro-taze gene”. The gene is involved in the release of serotonin,
a neurotransmitter that promotes neural connections. The extra copy increases the production of
serotonin and the brain’s ability to reuse it. Researchers have also found that personality
traits such as risk taking and openness to experience contribute to creativity as an
individual ability. But creativity can also likely be trained,
honed, or taught. In separate studies, professional dancers,
artists, and musicians were all compared against novices in their fields. During active or mental improvisational sessions
where participants were asked to compose a 5-note tune, mentally compose a drawing, or
mentally perform a dance, those who were professionally creative actually thought about the task differently,
engaging different areas of their brains than the novices. And then, there’s a point where nature and
nurture meet (which kinda happens all the time!). In The Genetics of Creativity, Barbot, Tan
and Grigorenko write, “it is important to see creativity not only as an individual ability,
but also as a cultural and time-specific phenomenon that is biologically grounded and has a social
purpose” They suggest that cultural factors, like the reception of creative works, influences
our biological factors, like how willing we are to take risks. And the two have a dynamic relationship. Still, while some people may have small biological
advantages to be more creative, anyone can be creative. You just need to nurture your creativity. Practice your craft, try approaching a problems
in unique ways, and let your mind wander. So, What could you do with this brick? “I love that neither of us have said anything
that has to do with actually building LEGOs” “Yeah! Maybe you could connect it to another LEGO
brick and then make something that way” You didn’t say we had many bricks! You just said we had A brick... I know! Minimalist LEGO sculptures. Just one brick.”

tests were more likely to have an extra copy of “the glucose mu-ta-ro-taze gene”. The gene is involved in the release of serotonin,
a neurotransmitter that promotes neural connections. The extra copy increases the production of
serotonin and the brain’s ability to reuse it. Researchers have also found that personality
traits such as risk taking and openness to experience contribute to creativity as an
individual ability. But creativity can also likely be trained,
honed, or taught. In separate studies, professional dancers,
artists, and musicians were all compared against novices in their fields. During active or mental improvisational sessions
where participants were asked to compose a 5-note tune, mentally compose a drawing, or
mentally perform a dance, those who were professionally creative actually thought about the task differently,
engaging different areas of their brains than the novices. And then, there’s a point where nature and
nurture meet (which kinda happens all the time!). In The Genetics of Creativity, Barbot, Tan
and Grigorenko write, “it is important to see creativity not only as an individual ability,
but also as a cultural and time-specific phenomenon that is biologically grounded and has a social
purpose” They suggest that cultural factors, like the reception of creative works, influences
our biological factors, like how willing we are to take risks. And the two have a dynamic relationship. Still, while some people may have small biological
advantages to be more creative, anyone can be creative. You just need to nurture your creativity. Practice your craft, try approaching a problems
in unique ways, and let your mind wander. So, What could you do with this brick? “I love that neither of us have said anything
that has to do with actually building LEGOs” “Yeah! Maybe you could connect it to another LEGO
brick and then make something that way” You didn’t say we had many bricks! You just said we had A brick... I know! Minimalist LEGO sculptures. Just one brick.”

So I need you to answer a question – you
only have five seconds to respond and you can have as many answers as you like… Ready? How many uses can you think of for this brick? This is an alternative uses test, they’re
used to measure creative thinking and how flexible people are in approaching a task. Here’s one of the tests I prepared earlier… “Yeah, you could um, you could make very
interesting cookie patterns, I guess?” “You could use it as you would a domino
in a rube goldberg machine” “You could put it in a tin can and make
a rattle out of it” Where creativity comes from has mystified
us for centuries. Throughout history, we believed that creativity
was rare and seen in a small elite: professional painters, poets, performers, and musicians. For a long time, creativity was an enigma,
beyond the reach of science. But today, we know that it takes creativity
to solve problems, it’s an aspect of human intelligence. We find creativity in architecture, science,
engineering and even in nature. Creativity is everywhere! And in the past few decades, there have been
dozens of studies exploring it using brain imaging technology. We’ve found you don’t just use the left
or right hemisphere of your brain when you’re thinking creatively. There isn’t one single brain area or circuit
for creativity – professional artists suffering from damage to different brain regions continue
to produce art showing similar creativity. Over forty different areas of the brain are
likely involved with creativity. I could list them all for you, but your mind
might start to wander... Which might be a good thing! Humans spend an average of 30% of our day
engaged in "mind-wandering." A lot of these studies say that mind wandering
helps get our creativity flowing. But… why? How can we not pay attention and manage to
hit on an idea that’s just right? Some scientists think that mind-wandering
might distract you from your perceived obstacles or it may allow your subconscious to keep
working on the problem without your higher cognitive functions getting involved. Mind wandering may also promote your brain's
ability to restructure the way you look at a problem, perhaps you’ll make connections
between two seemingly unrelated things and come up with novel, creative solutions. “Oh! You could melt it and then pour it into a
mould and sculpt something else out of it!” Ok, so everyone's mind wanders. Then why aren't we all creative geniuses? Well, our biology may play a part too: In

Look at this note. It's from the Blue
Book Modeling Agency in 1945. It says Norma Jean, who you might also know as Marilyn Monroe, was in fact, a size 12. LYNN BOORADY: She was. but back in the 50s, a size 12 was very thin. That was a model. You know, a size 12 then would be about a size 6 now. Well, to be exact, she would be a size 8 at
Topshop, 6 at Zara, and 4 to 6 at American Apparel. ..to actually show you the inconsistencies,
I went shopping. I bought 3 jeans at 3 different stores, all
in the same size. We’re already off to a bad start. These all look different. This is not a 4. This one is the one in the middle. This one fits! Hold up. It won’t zip. I give up. Let’s wind back a little bit. It was the Napoleonic wars and later
the Civil War in the US that demanded a sizing system for the mass production of clothing for the first time. It was for men’s uniforms. After that, men’s suit sizes were based
on the chest measurement and the rest was calculated accordingly, assuming that their bodies were in proportion. The demands for mass production of uniforms escalated and ready-made clothing became really popular. By the end of the nineteenth century, most
people were wearing ready-made clothes. In 1939, the US government funded statisticians
to collect the weight and 58 measurements of 15,000 women. LYNN BOORADY: They only used white women, even
though they took measurements of women of color, they didn’t include them in the study
or the calculations. The women who would’ve turned out for these studies were the poor women because they would be paid. So the data set even back then was possibly malnourished women, certainly poor women, and not very diverse group of women… and that’s what
we started with. They were looking for key measurements that
could predict the sizes of other parts of the body, the way chest sizes had for men. But women’s bodies, with variable breast
and hip sizes, were much harder to summarize with a single number. So, the data was used to create a
system in 1958 with sizes from 8 to 42, an arbitrary number based on bust size, combined
with a letter for height and a plus or minus for hips. The sizing chart was really unpopular, so
they made some updates, but finally in 1983 it was completely withdrawn. In the 1970s and 80s, companies started labeling the sizes down, and adding lower numbers like
2, zero and now even double zero. So the waist measurement that used to be a
size 12 became an 8. LYNN BOORADY: Vanity sizing specifically, is when the size on the label is lowered artificially, in order to tempt to get somebody to buy
the garment. So you’re appealing to the person’s vanity. Sizing has become a marketing tool. LYNN BOORADY: I think it’s done because the women are getting bigger,
we’re just addressing that. When the first standardizing chart came out
in 1958 it was mostly built out of malnourished, white women. Now, that there’s such a wide group of people
to cover, the retailers are picking a certain group of people to sell to, honing in what
works with that group and what doesn’t. LYNN BOORADY: I think we’re more aiming for our own target markets. So, when Abercrombie & Fitch does their sizing,
they’re sizing to their target market not to me. We kept tweaking that information
until we sold more garments and could lower the return rate. That means, even brands owned by the same company will have inconsistent sizes. A size 8 at Banana Republic will have the
same hip size as a size 2 at the Gap. So if you get frustrated while shopping…. LYNN BOORADY: It’s not you, it’s the industry, it’s not women’s bodies, we’re fine the way we are. They are just random numbers, they don’t
mean anything. And if you don’t like your size just cut
it out of your clothes.

**Transcript**:
Thank you to Gates Notes for supporting PBS. Hey smart people, Joe here. 
This is 500 mousetraps and   500 ping pong balls. And this is a Slow-Mo Guy. Hello! Today, we are going to set all of these off. But why, Joe? Because it's gonna look awesome. And to show you why vaccines 
work, not just by protecting you,   but also how they can protect a whole 
population. And I'm gonna do that, with this. [dramatic music] [music] I got a flu shot this year. That 
means I’m essentially immune to   this particular strain of the flu virus. My 
immune system is like “I’ve seen you before,   you’re not welcome here” and I'll never really 
get sick with this particular strain of the flu. Wow. I've got a lot of work to do. That’s one goal of vaccines—to protect 
individuals from getting sick—and   they do that really well. But there’s an even 
bigger goal that most people don’t think about:   Getting enough people in a population 
immune to a disease so that the whole   group ends up protected, even people who didn’t 
get the vaccine. How does that work exactly? It’s a concept called herd immunity. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, 
the term “herd immunity” has been all over   the news. Herd immunity is an idea that goes 
back at least 100 years. From what we know,   veterinarians coined the term in the early 
20th century when talking about protecting   actual herds from disease. Later, scientists 
started applying the idea to human diseases. When people talk about herd immunity today, 
what they really mean is an idea scientists call   “herd threshold”: In other words, “we need some 
key percentage of the population immune to a germ   to stop disease transmission.” And that 
threshold is different for every germ. Let’s say a germ lands here, and 
none of these people are immune. And suppose one person can give 
that germ to 4 others on average. That germ has a basic reproduction number of 
4, which we write as an R with a little sub   “zero”. And you can see that this 
infection gets out of control really fast And we can show how infections 
spread on a larger scale   using a thousand mousetraps and ping pong balls. At least that's what we though we'd 
have. But it turned out that setting   up 1000 mousetraps and ping pong balls 
turned out to be kind of impossible. So I was going to the bathroom, and I 
heard the worst sound I've ever heard in   my life. 500 mousetraps being triggered 
before we were done setting them up. "Round 2, fight" [mousetraps going off] "why are we still here, just to suffer?" This is the third time we've done 
this, I'm not going to explain why. Ok, so after some minor adjustments 
and recalculations we can NOW   show how infections spread on a larger scale 
using 500 mousetraps. And since this whole   thing takes like 2 seconds to happen, we brought 
in Gavin from the Slow-Mo Guys to shoot in super   slow-motion at 1000 frames per second. Plus 
he knows a thing or two about mousetraps. 3… 2… 1…
[dramatic mousetrap noises] I think it worked! Oh boy Gah! Ok, so we shot that in 4k at 1000 frames per 
second. It was quite a slow start, wasn't it? It was! I thought it wasn't gonna work! That one sent into the middle. Wow, that's amazing. This is exactly how a pandemic works. It's like you've got 2 outbreaks at the moment. Oh there they go. Yeah, here it goes. Amazing. Haha, look at you in the background. I don't want to get a mousetrap to the 
eye. I'm not sure we're insured for that.   This is currently where we are in the pandemic. I think that one's me there, hiding at home. This shows it perfectly. Exactly 
how fast a pandemic can break out.   It took a little longer in real 
life than 3 seconds, but it got bad! [mousetrap noises] I'd say that worked. Except if this was a 
pandemic, I guess that's not a good thing. Great demonstration, though! And this 
guy is happy as Larry. He's still fine. He's good. Way to stay home, bud. So how do we keep a pandemic from 
growing? By giving people immunity   without them getting sick. How do you do 
that? Vaccines! That's what vaccines are for. Oh that's the one, yeah. Let’s go back to this example. To keep 
the number of infected people from growing   you need each sick person to give the germ 
to 1 or fewer people. That would mean if   an infected person sneezes on four people, 
at least three of those people are immune. The germ has a low probability of ever 
encountering someone it can infect, so eventually   the whole group ends up protected. Now let's see 
this version in action, but with our mouse traps… So now all of these white balls 
are sat on inactive mousetraps. That's right, those basically represent 
people who have gotten the vaccine.   So they can't explode their coronavirus 
all over the rest of the table.   And hopefully when we throw this in there it'll 
look a little bit different than the last one. 3… 2… 1… [mousetrap noises] Interestingly, we still had a couple of 
little hotspots. But the herd was immune. Playing back now. We get a couple there. That's like a bad family party. See, that one landed on all the white balls. And we get maybe one more. Those are 
like a buffer for all the other ones. That makes sense, because vaccines might not work 
100% of the time, but they can protect the entire   population. Even though this is a lot 
less interesting than the first version. Yeah, the more boring this footage gets, the 
better we're proving the point about vaccines. Right, and maybe the more boring this 
footage gets, the more normal life can be. I miss boring. I miss boring too. As you just saw, it’s clear that by immunizing 
enough people (or mouse traps), we stopped the   chain reaction of infection, and we protected the 
whole population. But I wanna dig a little deeper,   because the science gets really interesting, and 
I know you guys like to nerd out as much as I do. To reach “herd immunity” in the mouse trap 
example, our threshold was this. But different   germs have different herd immunity thresholds, 
depending on how contagious they are. For, say,   measles… it’s super contagious. One infected 
person can infect 12 to 18 other people.   So you need 94% of the “herd” immune to stop 
the spread. Polio is 7, so the threshold is   85% immune. These thresholds are where we 
get our goals for mass vaccination programs. There’s a pretty simple bit of math to 
figure out the minimum proportion of a   population that has to be immunized to stop 
an infection with a given reproduction number.   Graphed out, it looks like this So what’s the R0 for the 
virus that causes COVID-19?   This is one thing that scientists are 
still trying to figure out for certain,   but it’s likely somewhere in here . That means 
to keep infections from growing, this percentage   of the population needs to be immune. And if 
the virus mutates to become more contagious,   you can see that the percent of the population 
that’s immune would need to be even higher.   The fastest, safest way to reach that 
level of immunity is with vaccines. Vaccines currently prevent 2 to 3 million 
deaths every year from diseases like   diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, 
influenza and measles. They are   basically the best public health 
tool since toilets and clean water. Does everyone who gets the vaccine become 
immune? No, but an effective vaccine works in   most people. For instance, the measles 
vaccine? That works in about 97% of people. For the COVID-19 vaccines, the data tells us they 
protect more than 90% of people who get the the   shot, or shots, since many of them work best with 
two doses. And that 90-plus percent is good news,   because it’s almost impossible to make sure 
absolutely every person gets a vaccine. Say 60 percent of people get a vaccine that’s 
effective 90% of the time. That’s only 54% percent   effective protection, which is below the 
threshold our math tells us we need for COVID.   But for a vaccine that’s 90% effective, if 75% 
of people get it, we’re above the threshold. In the end the important thing is 
to get enough people vaccinated   based on how effective a given vaccine is. In the real world, disease outbreaks 
are a bit more complicated than mouse   traps or simple graphs, but this model 
explains what health officials try to do: We have a group of susceptible people 
here. Some of them get infected   and go here. And from there they 
either recover, here, or they die. To control a germ, the goal 
is to get enough people here   and fewer people here so the germ has 
no susceptible people left to infect. Some people argue we should get people 
into the immune bucket by just letting   them get infected and then recover. Like a 
big global chickenpox party for COVID-19. But without a vaccine, if the only pathway 
to this recovered group is to get infected,   that means some number of 
people are going to end up here   (dead). What a vaccine does is lets you jump 
straight from here to here and avoid here. And if we have a choice that lets us 
avoid death, why wouldn’t we take it? We know this has worked before, with diseases like 
measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and polio.   They usually flare up in cycles. Because as 
more people got infected and recovered the   disease would slow down. Until new babies 
were born, letting the virus find a new   susceptible population, and a new outbreak 
would happen. Vaccines helped disrupt these   cycles by keeping the susceptible population 
low for longer periods of time. In some cases,   vaccines can disrupt the cycles so much that 
they can completely eradicate the germs from the   planet - this has happened twice - one time with a 
human disease - smallpox, and another time with an   animal disease - rinderpest. And there are efforts 
ongoing now to use vaccines to eradicate polio. In fact, vaccines work so well, 
they have a funny way of fooling   people into thinking they don’t need them anymore. Over the past several years, measles 
vaccination rates have stalled out around 85%.   That’s 10% less than we need to keep outbreaks of 
this super infectious disease at bay. And we’re   starting to see the effects. Last year, a 
whopping 870,000 measles cases were reported.   And measles deaths hit a 23-year high. And 
at least half of the countries that suspended   measles vaccination campaigns because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic have reported new outbreaks. The point is we have to stay vigilant. Vaccines 
are critical to ending a pandemic like COVID-19,   but it won’t happen overnight. A raging 
forest fire doesn't stop the moment people   start spraying water on it, and neither does a 
pandemic just because a vaccine is available. In today’s society, one infected person 
can move across the world to a susceptible   community really quickly… and one little 
spark has the potential to start a new fire. And one of the biggest challenges facing public 
health officials is making sure different   communities and different parts of the world 
have access to vaccines. Making enough of them,   making them affordable, and making sure 
people understand why they’re important. That gets us back to that surprising reason 
vaccines are important. Vaccines aren’t just   for you. They’re for you AND everyone else. 
When vaccines for these germs first came out,   infections also went down in older populations 
that didn’t actually get immunized. We know   this works, and it can work again with everyone’s 
help. Every vaccine that’s given has the potential   to protect more than one person, and that’s a 
beautiful way to end a disease if you ask me. One more thing: It’s important to remember that   how bad a germ is has a lot to do with us. 
Diseases aren’t just something that happens to us,   their infectiveness isn’t set in stone, and our 
behavior can play a big part in keeping us safe. Things like masks, social distancing, 
hygiene, they still matter alongside vaccines. And that looks like this. What are you doing? I wanted to put us in there, so 
I'm just drawing. This is you. My head's not nearly that round. I also couldn't remember what the nose and 
mouth look like. So I just drew the mask. There are no noses and mouths. Let's do this. [dramatic music]
[absolutely nothing happening] It might be the worst thing I've ever shot. This

**Transcript**:
Thank you to Gates Notes for supporting PBS. Hey smart people, Joe here. 
This is 500 mousetraps and   500 ping pong balls. And this is a Slow-Mo Guy. Hello! Today, we are going to set all of these off. But why, Joe? Because it's gonna look awesome. And to show you why vaccines 
work, not just by protecting you,   but also how they can protect a whole 
population. And I'm gonna do that, with this. [dramatic music] [music] I got a flu shot this year. That 
means I’m essentially immune to   this particular strain of the flu virus. My 
immune system is like “I’ve seen you before,   you’re not welcome here” and I'll never really 
get sick with this particular strain of the flu. Wow. I've got a lot of work to do. That’s one goal of vaccines—to protect 
individuals from getting sick—and   they do that really well. But there’s an even 
bigger goal that most people don’t think about:   Getting enough people in a population 
immune to a disease so that the whole   group ends up protected, even people who didn’t 
get the vaccine. How does that work exactly? It’s a concept called herd immunity. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, 
the term “herd immunity” has been all over   the news. Herd immunity is an idea that goes 
back at least 100 years. From what we know,   veterinarians coined the term in the early 
20th century when talking about protecting   actual herds from disease. Later, scientists 
started applying the idea to human diseases. When people talk about herd immunity today, 
what they really mean is an idea scientists call   “herd threshold”: In other words, “we need some 
key percentage of the population immune to a germ   to stop disease transmission.” And that 
threshold is different for every germ. Let’s say a germ lands here, and 
none of these people are immune. And suppose one person can give 
that germ to 4 others on average. That germ has a basic reproduction number of 
4, which we write as an R with a little sub   “zero”. And you can see that this 
infection gets out of control really fast And we can show how infections 
spread on a larger scale   using a thousand mousetraps and ping pong balls. At least that's what we though we'd 
have. But it turned out that setting   up 1000 mousetraps and ping pong balls 
turned out to be kind of impossible. So I was going to the bathroom, and I 
heard the worst sound I've ever heard in   my life. 500 mousetraps being triggered 
before we were done setting them up. "Round 2, fight" [mousetraps going off] "why are we still here, just to suffer?" This is the third time we've done 
this, I'm not going to explain why. Ok, so after some minor adjustments 
and recalculations we can NOW   show how infections spread on a larger scale 
using 500 mousetraps. And since this whole   thing takes like 2 seconds to happen, we brought 
in Gavin from the Slow-Mo Guys to shoot in super   slow-motion at 1000 frames per second. Plus 
he knows a thing or two about mousetraps. 3… 2… 1…
[dramatic mousetrap noises] I think it worked! Oh boy Gah! Ok, so we shot that in 4k at 1000 frames per 
second. It was quite a slow start, wasn't it? It was! I thought it wasn't gonna work! That one sent into the middle. Wow, that's amazing. This is exactly how a pandemic works. It's like you've got 2 outbreaks at the moment. Oh there they go. Yeah, here it goes. Amazing. Haha, look at you in the background. I don't want to get a mousetrap to the 
eye. I'm not sure we're insured for that.   This is currently where we are in the pandemic. I think that one's me there, hiding at home. This shows it perfectly. Exactly 
how fast a pandemic can break out.   It took a little longer in real 
life than 3 seconds, but it got bad! [mousetrap noises] I'd say that worked. Except if this was a 
pandemic, I guess that's not a good thing. Great demonstration, though! And this 
guy is happy as Larry. He's still fine. He's good. Way to stay home, bud. So how do we keep a pandemic from 
growing? By giving people immunity   without them getting sick. How do you do 
that? Vaccines! That's what vaccines are for. Oh that's the one, yeah. Let’s go back to this example. To keep 
the number of infected people from growing   you need each sick person to give the germ 
to 1 or fewer people. That would mean if   an infected person sneezes on four people, 
at least three of those people are immune. The germ has a low probability of ever 
encountering someone it can infect, so eventually   the whole group ends up protected. Now let's see 
this version in action, but with our mouse traps… So now all of these white balls 
are sat on inactive mousetraps. That's right, those basically represent 
people who have gotten the vaccine.   So they can't explode their coronavirus 
all over the rest of the table.   And hopefully when we throw this in there it'll 
look a little bit different than the last one. 3… 2… 1… [mousetrap noises] Interestingly, we still had a couple of 
little hotspots. But the herd was immune. Playing back now. We get a couple there. That's like a bad family party. See, that one landed on all the white balls. And we get maybe one more. Those are 
like a buffer for all the other ones. That makes sense, because vaccines might not work 
100% of the time, but they can protect the entire   population. Even though this is a lot 
less interesting than the first version. Yeah, the more boring this footage gets, the 
better we're proving the point about vaccines. Right, and maybe the more boring this

**Transcript**:
the big short is probably one of the most popular films on the topic of investing it's a star-studded movie that follows the real story of three groups of people who short or bet against the housing market for billions of dollars right before the 2008 real estate crisis as you might expect our heroes end up making quite a bit of money but how exactly does a short work well in the movie the positions are taken through what are known as swaps a derivative agreement that is taken with the banks but for common investors short positions typically involve individual stocks make them easy enough to take but be warned shorting comes with a lot of risks on top of charging you expenses you don't normally see with standard investing shorting also offers a skewed payoff where you face a limited upside in an uncapped downside meaning you could lose an infinite amount of money theoretically anyway so before you decide to short something let's go over the strategy in the risks involved on today's plain bagel [Music] shorting also known as short selling is a trading strategy where an investor sells a security today and buys it back in the future hoping that the price of the security will go down it's effectively the opposite approach to a traditional long position where investors buy today and sell at some point in the future to cash in hopefully after the price has gone up it follows the same buy low sell high mentality as long investing but it just reverses the order of the motto so investors sell high today and hope that the price will go down so they can buy low in the future now shortening on a stock is a bit more complicated than going long on a position so let's go through a running example to explain how the strategy works in the risks it poses imagine you have to investors who decide to take opposite positions in plain bagel Co the company stock currently has a market price of $10 investor a decides to buy 1,000 of these stocks thereby investing $10,000 one investor B decides to short 1,000 stocks thereby selling 10,000 dollars worth of the investment now I know what you're thinking how the hell do you sell a stock that you don't own well oftentimes the process involves selling a borrowed security for example in a brokerage account you can often sell a position by borrowing a stock from your broker and then shorting that way leaving you with the proceeds from the sale the money you make from the sale obviously doesn't really belong to you since you sold someone else's stock to get it but eventually when you buy the security back known as covering your short you'll be able to return the stock and keep whatever money is left over which is how you profit from the trade so going back to our example the stock price falls from $10 to $5 investor a will lose $5,000 one investor B will gain $5,000 since they'll be able to buy the stock back for a lower price and keep the remaining sales proceeds on the other side of things if the stock price increases from ten to fifteen dollars investor aid will be up five thousand dollars while investor B will be down five thousand but this raises an interesting question up until this point investor B hasn't actually contributed any of their own money so how is he going to buy back the stock for more money than what's in the account well this is where the concept of margins come into play you see too short a position an investor needs to post what's known as an initial margin a 50% into their account to act as a buffer should the investment lose value this means that investor B would have contributed five thousand dollars of his own funds at the beginning of our example to accommodate for any losses the amount still belongs to the investor but it's held as collateral by the broker to ensure that investor B can afford to buy back the share in the future investor B will also be responsible for what are known as margin calls a process that occurs when the margin becomes insufficient for example in the event that the share price rises to $15 investor B would receive a margin call to replenish their cash buffer based on what's known as the maintenance margin since there's no more wiggle room in the account to accommodate for further losses so a big difference between shorting and going long a position is that you can only short in a margin account while this has its downsides it does add leverage to the investors return what do I mean by that well let's go back to our example let's say that our share price falls from 10 to 5 dollars this would leave investor aid to lose $5,000 an investor be to gain $5,000 on an absolute basis these returns equate one another but on a percentage basis taking into account margins they're actually quite different you see investor a has lost roughly 50% of their investment but since investor B has only contributed five thousand dollars of his own money to this margin account he's actually gained 100 percent of his investment doubled the percentage of investor a because borrowing is involved with shorting investor B will see his returns amplified though this goes both ways percentage losses in the short position will be double what they might have been for investor a so will decline a 50% for investor a would translate into a one hundred percent decline for investor B so short positions not only flip the percentage return received by investors but they also amplify them both on the way up and the way down but here's where we get into the distinct disadvantages of a short position namely short positions come with unique costs that a standard long investor won't face for example if the stock you borrow pays a dividend you'll actually need to pay this amount to your broker meaning that you'll face a cost equal to whatever dividend the stock pays short positions also charge investors in interest rate on the value of the stock you borrowed after all since you are borrowing and selling someone else's security you need to compensate them in the same way that you would compensate a bank with interest on a loan typically the rate charge on a short position can range anywhere from 2.5 to 20 percent but it can be higher for what are known as hard to borrow stocks highly volatile or small cap positions so needless to say shorting the stock can be quite a bit more expensive than a simple buy but for the most part these expenses are fair the interest makes sense since you are taking a leveraged position and since you are trying to inverse the return of a long position it's only natural that you pay out the dividend received from the stock but there are some absolute disadvantages involved with the short strategy some of which may very well turn you off the idea of ever trying to short a stock for one short strategies face what's known as buy-in risk the chance that a broker will make you prematurely cover your position this can occur for a number of reasons a broker may need to return a stock to the portfolio they took it from or the stock may simply see a surge in demand but the end result is that you may be forced to close your position at any time this is a pretty significant drawback especially when it comes to waiting out market volatility in our example perhaps investor B is confident that certain factors whether it be regulation or technological change will cause the stock to crash in two years time but if the price surges in the near term they may be forced to realize a loss even if they end up being right on top of this when shorting a position you may experience what's known as a short squeeze when a heavily shorted stock sees its price surge because the investors shorting the stock need to cover their physician since investors who short sell have a appropriately shorter time horizon than long investors this is a chance that they buy back the stock around the same time which can lead to a surge in the price and make it harder for you to cover your own position without realizing a loss so as you can see there are some distinct disadvantages with shorting a position which alone may lead you to stay away but perhaps the biggest risk with short positions has to do with their skewed payoff with her to investors longing in shorting the $10.00 stock we face to risk reward profiles on the one hand investor a can theoretically earn an infinitely high return the $10,000 investment in the ten dollar stock could double triple quadruple in value as the stock price climbs to 20 30 $40 or higher on the downside the most she can lose is the money she's invested the $10,000 which would only happen if the stock fell to 0 a pretty drastic outcome now investor B actually flips the risk reward here if the stock drops down to 0 ignoring fees they can achieve a 200% return since they are able to keep the $10,000 your profits from their $5,000 investment on the other hand if the stock instead climbs to 20 30 $40 or higher they can lose 200 400 600 percent or more this means that you can lose a lot more money than what you've initially invested and indeed this very feature has had devastating impacts on the investors this is why many investors tend to stick with long lonely positions for many of the return is simply not worth the risk and on top of the fact that you're going against the natural upward bias of stocks you're more or less betting against a company that is actively trying to prove you wrong short selling certainly does play an important role in the world of investments and indeed you can make a lot of money by placing the short bet against a deteriorating stock but if you're looking to speculate with short selling tread lightly you may end up buying off a lot more than you can

**Transcript**:
the big short is probably one of the most popular films on the topic of investing it's a star-studded movie that follows the real story of three groups of people who short or bet against the housing market for billions of dollars right before the 2008 real estate crisis as you might expect our heroes end up making quite a bit of money but how exactly does a short work well in the movie the positions are taken through what are known as swaps a derivative agreement that is taken with the banks but for common investors short positions typically involve individual stocks make them easy enough to take but be warned shorting comes with a lot of risks on top of charging you expenses you don't normally see with standard investing shorting also offers a skewed payoff where you face a limited upside in an uncapped downside meaning you could lose an infinite amount of money theoretically anyway so before you decide to short something let's go over the strategy in the risks involved on today's plain bagel [Music] shorting also known as short selling is a trading strategy where an investor sells a security today and buys it back in the future hoping that the price of the security will go down it's effectively the opposite approach to a traditional long position where investors buy today and sell at some point in the future to cash in hopefully after the price has gone up it follows the same buy low sell high mentality as long investing but it just reverses the order of the motto so investors sell high today and hope that the price will go down so they can buy low in the future now shortening on a stock is a bit more complicated than going long on a position so let's go through a running example to explain how the strategy works in the risks it poses imagine you have to investors who decide to take opposite positions in plain bagel Co the company stock currently has a market price of $10 investor a decides to buy 1,000 of these stocks thereby investing $10,000 one investor B decides to short 1,000 stocks thereby selling 10,000 dollars worth of the investment now I know what you're thinking how the hell do you sell a stock that you don't own well oftentimes the process involves selling a borrowed security for example in a brokerage account you can often sell a position by borrowing a stock from your broker and then shorting that way leaving you with the proceeds from the sale the money you make from the sale obviously doesn't really belong to you since you sold someone else's stock to get it but eventually when you buy the security back known as covering your short you'll be able to return the stock and keep whatever money is left over which is how you profit from the trade so going back to our example the stock price falls from $10 to $5 investor a will lose $5,000 one investor B will gain $5,000 since they'll be able to buy the stock back for a lower price and keep the remaining sales proceeds on the other side of things if the stock price increases from ten to fifteen dollars investor aid will be up five thousand dollars while investor B will be down five thousand but this raises an interesting question up until this point investor B hasn't actually contributed any of their own money so how is he going to buy back the stock for more money than what's in the account well this is where the concept of margins come into play you see too short a position an investor needs to post what's known as an initial margin a 50% into their account to act as a buffer should the investment lose value this means that investor B would have contributed five thousand dollars of his own funds at the beginning of our example to accommodate for any losses the amount still belongs to the investor but it's held as collateral by the broker to ensure that investor B can afford to buy back the share in the future investor B will also be responsible for what are known as margin calls a process that occurs when the margin becomes insufficient for example in the event that the share price rises to $15 investor B would receive a margin call to replenish their cash buffer based on what's known as the maintenance margin since there's no more wiggle room in the account to accommodate for further losses so a big difference between shorting and going long a position is that you can only short in a margin account while this

**Transcript**:
- Why is the sky blue? It's one of the most common questions asked by both kids and adults, unless you're from ancient Greece. I know, I know, you'd think the country that is now ubiquitously known
for beautiful blue rooftops, crystal blue waters, and a blue flag would have a longer
history with the color. But if you were to read Homer, uh, not that one, the famous ancient Greek writer
from the 8th century B.C., you'd notice that the word
blue isn't mentioned once. Through thousands of pages of
"The Iliad" and "The Odyssey," black is mentioned 170 times,
white 100, red 13 times, yellow and green each around
10, but blue never appears. What's weirder is that
Homer describes things that we would normally
call blue, like the ocean, as wine-dark. He even calls honey
green and sheep violet. For a while, some suggested that maybe the ancient Greeks just saw
colors different than we do, or maybe they were all color blind. But we now know that
color vision developed around 30 million years
ago so that's not it. It gets even crazier. As historians and researchers
began looking into other ancient civilizations,
they realized the same thing. Almost none of them used the word blue. From Icelandic texts
to ancient Indian epics dating to about four millennia ago, to ancient Chinese writings, and even the original Hebrew Bible, all of them fail to mention blue once, while all of them mention
black, white, and red, and many, the Bible included,
also mention green and yellow. Again, it's not like they
don't talk about things that we would call blue. They describe the ocean
as wide, stormy, silent, but never blue. It wasn't until the mid-1800s that linguists began to analyze
the history of languages and found something peculiar. In every culture, black
and white are first. Then the first color to enter
the language is always red. Then yellow follows, then green. And then blue is the final
color to enter language in every single culture. Over the years, researchers have found some minor exceptions
with the middle order, so green and yellow, but red is always first
and blue is always last in every single language. So, why this order? There's two main theories. First, the evolutionary
explanation is simple. Black and white help distinguish
between night and day, light and dark, and are
the most clear and useful, so every culture has those. Then red, it's often associated
with blood or danger. Even human faces and communication use red through the galvanic skin response, like when you blush or are stressed. Green and yellow entered language
as the need to distinguish between ripe and unripe foods. And blue? There's very few blue things
that we actually interact with. Blue fruits are pretty rare. Blue animals are rare too. And when they are blue,
it's often not a pigment, but a sort of light illusion,
like in butterflies. Even the modern European
language words for blue are derived from ancient
words for black or green. The second explanation suggests that these words don't enter language until humans could make them. Red being the easiest and
most accessible color, because you just take a piece of dry clay and use it as a crayon. If you think of cave, for example, there's a lot of black and red in them. But blue? It's one of the hardest colors to create. For thousands because of years, nobody had it except the Egyptians, and they had a word for it. So does this mean that
ancient people couldn't see those colors before
they had a word for it? Not exactly. Early humans would have considered colors as simply hues of black, white, or red, which sounds kind of crazy, but there's actually modern
day evidence for this. If you look at these 12 colors, can you spot the one that's different? We might think clearly it's this one, but when presented with a similar chart, the Himba people of Namibia, who don't have a separate word for blue, take longer to point out this distinction. On the contrary, when
looking at green colors, they are more quickly able
to note the difference that we wouldn't catch
as quickly, this one. And this is because they have
more words for types of green than we do in English. In fact, one of their
color categories clumps some types of blue and green together, while they have other color categories for different greens still. In the 1890s, anthropologists discovered that indigenous islanders in
New Guinea described the sky as black or dirty like water. Which, if you think about
it, isn't that surprising. Even if you look at a
color picker in Photoshop, it's clear that a dark or
navy blue isn't actually that far from being black, and is quite far from other hues which we would still call blue. In that sense, black would
have been a much broader term for early and ancient humans. It's kinda like how these
are all shades of red. We wouldn't call them
different colors necessarily. But this, in English, we call pink. Even though it's technically
just another shade of red, we've decided to categorize it as separate and as a result, it's
different in our minds. Of course, even if we didn't name it pink, we'd still be able to see
that it's a different color, a lighter hue, but ultimately, we'd
consider it a form of red. Now, you might be thinking
this just seems semantic. So what, they have different names. There's no functional difference in the actual color we're seeing. But neuroscience has
found that to be untrue. It turns out, and this is mind blowing, that language trains our brain
to see colors differently. What this means is once we
have a new word for a color, there's a feedback loop in the brain and this exaggerates the
differences between those colors, especially at the border
areas between them. We get used to calling these
colors as distinct hues and as a result, the
brain more aptly sees them as distinct hues. Without the word, you
would still see the color, but you wouldn't notice or
contextualize it in the same way. If that still feels bizarre,
because I know it did for me, think about learning a new language. At first, everything just
looks or sounds like gibberish. You can't tell the verbs
apart from the nouns, let alone one word from the next, because you are just learning. But slowly over time, your
brain starts to pick up on these categories and patterns and can recognize minor
differences much faster. It's not like you couldn't tell the words were different before, but it all sort of blended together. Once you become more familiar with it, you start to see and hear
those words much more clearly. Honestly, it's kinda like when
I learn a new English word and then suddenly I hear it everywhere, I see it everywhere. But the truth is I probably
came across that word before but just didn't notice it. But now that I've surely learned the word, the feedback loop is there
and so I truly notice it. It's a wild example of
how our amazing brains have allowed us to create language, but then that language turned back around and has an impact on brain function. Not only is our perception
of the world an illusion, our brains are an active
part of creating it. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found it as

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
- Why is the sky blue? It's one of the most common questions asked by both kids and adults, unless you're from ancient Greece. I know, I know, you'd think the country that is now ubiquitously known
for beautiful blue rooftops, crystal blue waters, and a blue flag would have a longer
history with the color. But if you were to read Homer, uh, not that one, the famous ancient Greek writer
from the 8th century B.C., you'd notice that the word
blue isn't mentioned once. Through thousands of pages of
"The Iliad" and "The Odyssey," black is mentioned 170 times,
white 100, red 13 times, yellow and green each around
10, but blue never appears. What's weirder is that
Homer describes things that we would normally
call blue, like the ocean, as wine-dark. He even calls honey
green and sheep violet. For a while, some suggested that maybe the ancient Greeks just saw
colors different than we do, or maybe they were all color blind. But we now know that
color vision developed around 30 million years
ago so that's not it. It gets even crazier. As historians and researchers
began looking into other ancient civilizations,
they realized the same thing. Almost none of them used the word blue. From Icelandic texts
to ancient Indian epics dating to about four millennia ago, to ancient Chinese writings, and even the original Hebrew Bible, all of them fail to mention blue once, while all of them mention
black, white, and red, and many, the Bible included,
also mention green and yellow. Again, it's not like they
don't talk about things that we would call blue. They describe the ocean
as wide, stormy, silent, but never blue. It wasn't until the mid-1800s that linguists began to analyze
the history of languages and found something peculiar. In every culture, black
and white are first. Then the first color to enter
the language is always red. Then yellow follows, then green. And then blue is the final
color to enter language in every single culture. Over the years, researchers have found some minor exceptions
with the middle order, so green and yellow, but red is always first
and blue is always last in every single language. So, why this order? There's two main theories. First, the evolutionary
explanation is simple. Black and white help distinguish
between night and day, light and dark, and are
the most clear and useful, so every culture has those. Then red, it's often associated
with blood or danger. Even human faces and communication use red through the galvanic skin response, like when you blush or are stressed. Green and yellow entered language
as the need to distinguish between ripe and unripe foods. And blue? There's very few blue things
that we actually interact with. Blue fruits are pretty rare. Blue animals are rare too. And when they are blue,
it's often not a pigment, but a sort of light illusion,
like in butterflies. Even the modern European
language words for blue are derived from ancient
words for black or green. The second explanation suggests that these words don't enter language until humans could make them. Red being the easiest and
most accessible color, because you just take a piece of dry clay and use it as a crayon. If you think of cave, for example, there's a lot of black and red in them. But blue? It's one of the hardest colors to create. For thousands because of years, nobody had it except the Egyptians, and they had a word for it. So does this mean that
ancient people couldn't see those colors before
they had a word for it? Not exactly. Early humans would have considered colors as simply hues of black, white, or red, which sounds kind of crazy, but there's actually modern
day evidence for this. If you look at these 12 colors, can you spot the one that's different? We might think clearly it's this one, but when presented with a similar chart, the Himba people of Namibia, who don't have a separate word for blue, take longer to point out this distinction. On the contrary, when
looking at green colors, they are more quickly able
to note the difference that we wouldn't catch
as quickly, this one. And this is because they have
more words for types of green than we do in English. In fact, one of their
color categories clumps some types of blue and green together, while they have other color categories for different greens still. In the 1890s, anthropologists discovered that indigenous islanders in
New Guinea described the sky as black or dirty like water. Which, if you think about
it, isn't that surprising. Even if you look at a
color picker in Photoshop, it's clear that a dark or
navy blue isn't actually that far from being black, and is quite far from other hues which we would still call blue. In that sense, black would
have been a much broader term for early and ancient humans. It's kinda like how these
are all shades of red. We wouldn't call them
different colors necessarily. But this, in English, we call pink. Even though it's technically
just another shade of red, we've decided to categorize it as separate and as a result, it's
different in our minds. Of course, even if we didn't name it pink, we'd still be able to see
that it's a different color, a lighter hue, but ultimately, we'd
consider it a form of red. Now, you might be thinking
this just seems semantic. So what, they have different names. There's no functional difference in the actual color we're seeing. But neuroscience has
found that to be untrue. It turns out, and this is mind blowing, that language trains our brain
to see colors differently. What this means is once we
have a new word for a color, there's a feedback loop in the brain and this exaggerates the
differences between those colors, especially at the border
areas between them. We get used to calling these
colors as distinct hues and as a result, the
brain more aptly sees them as distinct hues. Without the word, you
would still see the color, but you wouldn't notice or
contextualize it in the same way. If that still feels bizarre,
because I know it did for me, think about learning a new language. At first, everything just
looks or sounds like gibberish. You can't tell the verbs
apart from the nouns, let alone one word from the next, because you are just learning. But slowly over time, your
brain starts to pick up on these categories and patterns and can recognize minor
differences much faster. It's not like you couldn't tell the words were different before, but it all sort of blended together. Once you become more familiar with it, you start to see and hear
those words much more clearly. Honestly, it's kinda like when
I learn a new English word and then suddenly I hear it everywhere, I see it everywhere. But the truth is I probably
came across that word before but just didn't notice it. But now that I've surely learned the word, the feedback loop is there
and so I truly notice it. It's a wild example of
how our amazing brains have allowed us to create language, but then that language turned back around and has an impact on brain function. Not only is our perception
of the world an illusion, our brains are an active
part of creating it. Thank you so much for watching. I hope you found it as
interesting as I genuinely did. If you like our videos,

**Transcript**:
[GO PROJECT FILMS] [When a Town Runs Dry] [♪ music ♪] My grandfather started the farm. And we've been farming here
ever since. For the last couple years, we
haven't had the crop production that we're used to
when we have adequate water. We're struggling. I've had to sell some property
to try to keep in business. The little bit of land
that we did sell was a very emotional thing to do because
that's land that I worked with my dad and it's gone. Growing up in Stratford was
a wonderful thing as a child. [children talking] The canals were always filled
with water. We could spend a whole day
at the canal trying to catch crawdads,
hunting for frogs, fishing. We'd ride our bikes off
into the river. And we would swim in it. Nowadays,
there's no water there. I grew up in Yemen. Living over there
was really hard. So that is why we came
to the United States. First we moved to Oakland but I didn't feel
like home there. I wanted to move
to a smaller city. That's when I found Stratford. I really like living here but sometimes it gets hard
with the work. Since the drought has started we lost half the business. Most of the people
that come to my store they work for the farmers. Most of the farmers
they get broke, the workers they go
somewhere else to find work. I really feel bad
about the people. They have a rough time. This makes me sad because we were welcomed
by all the people here. Being able to work
with the ground and with nature
has been very satisfying. But of late
when the water has become scarce we don't get a lot of help
from the people who want the food
that we grow. This year probably two-thirds
to half of our farm has not been put
into cultivation because of lack of water. Without food production,
there's no jobs out in the rural communities. When you have the commodity
we tend to not plan for the future. Otherwise
we should have been planning years ago. You don't start thinking
about reality until you start seeing
the writing on the wall. Water is one thing, but you take a step back
and you look at what's going on in the community,
and it's heartbreaking. You've got to be grateful
for the people that are there from dusk to dawn
or even later than that. When those stores
close their doors, we're really going to be hurting
in that little community. You know, where are our kids
going to be able to go to go get a snack? When people don't have the money I start to run a tab with them. Some people they pay me back, some people they can't
because no work. Okay Kenny, thank you. - You have a good day.
- We'll see you next time. When you know the people when they can't make
no money, no work, it's hard to say "you know"
pay me my money back and you know they don't have it. We lost a lot. Sometimes you think I don't know
what to do anymore and we just keep going. Anything helps, you know,
anything helps. Any time someone puts
a little bit more effort into the community, [whistle]
the community stands stronger. And you just hope that it grasps
and it keeps moving forward. I would like my kids
to take over the farm and keep it going but
if it continues to deteriorate then the future is not bright
in agriculture. [cheering] The only thing we can do
is sell more land and that's like selling
part of yourself. [screams] There's no better life. It's not fast. There's not
a lot of money in it, but it's a fair living. So it would really be sad for me
to see this lifestyle come to an end. I hope the water
is coming back. When the rain comes back I hope a lot of work
and a lot of people come back. I really like living
in this town. I don't want to leave this town. [credits] [©2016 Go Project Films]

**Transcript**:
[GO PROJECT FILMS] [When a Town Runs Dry] [♪ music ♪] My grandfather started the farm. And we've been farming here
ever since. For the last couple years, we
haven't had the crop production that we're used to
when we have adequate water. We're struggling. I've had to sell some property
to try to keep in business. The little bit of land
that we did sell was a very emotional thing to do because
that's land that I worked with my dad and it's gone. Growing up in Stratford was
a wonderful thing as a child. [children talking] The canals were always filled
with water. We could spend a whole day
at the canal trying to catch crawdads,
hunting for frogs, fishing. We'd ride our bikes off
into the river. And we would swim in it. Nowadays,
there's no water there. I grew up in Yemen. Living over there
was really hard. So that is why we came
to the United States. First we moved to Oakland but I didn't feel
like home there. I wanted to move
to a smaller city. That's when I found Stratford. I really like living here but sometimes it gets hard
with the work. Since the drought has started we lost half the business. Most of the people
that come to my store they work for the farmers. Most of the farmers
they get broke, the workers they go
somewhere else to find work. I really feel bad
about the people. They have a rough time. This makes me sad because we were welcomed
by all the people here. Being able to work
with the ground and with nature
has been very satisfying. But of late
when the water has become scarce we don't get a lot of help
from the people who want the food
that we grow. This year probably two-thirds
to half of our farm has not been put
into cultivation because of lack of water. Without food production,
there's no jobs out in the rural communities. When you have the commodity
we tend to not plan for the future. Otherwise
we should have been planning years ago. You don't start thinking
about reality until you start seeing
the writing on the wall. Water is one thing, but you take a step back
and you look at what's going on in the community,
and it's heartbreaking. You've got to be grateful
for the people that are there from dusk to dawn
or even later than that. When those stores
close their doors, we're really going to be hurting
in that little community. You know, where are our kids
going to be able to go to go get a snack? When people don't have the money I start to run a tab with them. Some people they pay me back, some people they can't
because no work. Okay Kenny, thank you. - You have a good day.
- We'll see you next time. When you know the people when they can't make
no money, no work, it's hard to say "you know"
pay me my money back and you know they don't have it. We lost a lot. Sometimes you think I don't know
what to do anymore and we just keep going. Anything helps, you know,
anything helps. Any time someone puts
a little bit more effort into the community, [whistle]
the community stands stronger. And you just hope that it grasps
and it keeps moving forward. I would like my kids
to take over the farm and keep it going but
if it continues to deteriorate then the future is not bright
in agriculture. [cheering] The only thing we can do
is sell more land and that's like selling
part of yourself. [screams] There's no better life. It's not fast. There's not
a lot of money in it, but it's a fair living. So it would really be sad for me
to see this lifestyle come to an end. I hope the water
is coming back. When the rain comes back I hope a lot of work
and a lot of people come back. I really like living
in this town. I don't want to leave this town. [credits] [©2016 Go Project Films]

**Transcript**:
[Music] chances are you or someone you know is a vegetarian so we thought we'd try a thought experiment what would happen if everyone in the world was suddenly a vegetarian what effect would it have on our lives and the planet before we begin full disclosure none of us at ASAP science are vegetarians and the worldwide rate of vegetarianism is fairly low ranging from about 4 to 5% in the US and Canada to a little over 30% in India as a result there are currently about 20 billion chickens 1 5 billion cows over a billion sheep and nearly a billion pigs in the world without any meate eating humans to provide a market whole herds of domestic animals would disappear and this would free up vast quantities of land about 33 million square km of land are used for pasture an area about the size of Africa and that's not even counting the land used to grow crops exclusively for animal feed some of it would be needed for the increased amount of vegetable crops but much of the land currently used as pasture is actually too dry to grow crops without humans adding artificial nutrients this land could turn to desert but if properly managed it's possible that some Farmland would return to its natural state of grassland or Forest which could help counteract global climate change after all the loss of CO2 absorbing trees cleared for agriculture is a major reason why Global levels of CO2 are going up cows and other grazers also affect our climate through large amounts of methane production which has 25 times more potential planet warming power than CO2 combined with the loss of forests and other effects livestock production is responsible for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all the world's Planes Trains and Automobiles put together in fact many scientists believe that reducing meat consumption may be one of the best strategies for managing climate change a vegetarian diet would also greatly reduce water consumption around 70% of global freshwater consumption is used in agriculture it takes 15,000 L to make a kg of beef 6,000 L for pork and 4,000 L for chicken compare this with 1,600 L for cereal crops 900 L for fruit and 300 L for garden vegetables of course a kilogram of meat packs many more calories than the equivalent weight of fruit but even if you compare the ratio of water per calorie of available food energy beef is still five times more water intensive than fruit seven times more than veggies and 20 times more than cereal so are there any downsides to a vegetarian diet Well we'd be left without a cheap source for many byproducts of livestock like leather from animal hides or animal fats which are used in cosmetics candles and detergents and while vegetable-based Alternatives do exist their production would need to increase meaning more land dedicated to growing crops and less restored to its natural state a more complicated fact is that raising and processing animals is a full-time job for more than 1 billion people most of whom are small-scale farmers in the developing World while some may be able to move to producing milk or eggs or even Growing Vegetable crops many would be faced with their way of life becoming obsolete of course any increase in vegetarianism is likely to be a gradual process rather than a sudden cut off and surprisingly the trends are actually in the opposite direction in places like India and China people are becoming wealthier and as a result consuming more meat which effectively cancels out the declines we see in other countries so we actually tried to go vegetarian for 21 days straight as an experiment in our new ASAP thought episode check out the video if you want to see how it went what we learned in the process and how we felt about it both mentally and physically And subscribe for more weekly science videos

**Transcript**:
[Music] chances are you or someone you know is a vegetarian so we thought we'd try a thought experiment what would happen if everyone in the world was suddenly a vegetarian what effect would it have on our lives and the planet before we begin full disclosure none of us at ASAP science are vegetarians and the worldwide rate of vegetarianism is fairly low ranging from about 4 to 5% in the US and Canada to a little over 30% in India as a result there are currently about 20 billion chickens 1 5 billion cows over a billion sheep and nearly a billion pigs in the world without any meate eating humans to provide a market whole herds of domestic animals would disappear and this would free up vast quantities of land about 33 million square km of land are used for pasture an area about the size of Africa and that's not even counting the land used to grow crops exclusively for animal feed some of it would be needed for the increased amount of vegetable crops but much of the land currently used as pasture is actually too dry to grow crops without humans adding artificial nutrients this land could turn to desert but if properly managed it's possible that some Farmland would return to its natural state of grassland or Forest which could help counteract global climate change after all the loss of CO2 absorbing trees cleared for agriculture is a major reason why Global levels of CO2 are going up cows and other grazers also affect our climate through large amounts of methane production which has 25 times more potential planet warming power than CO2 combined with the loss of forests and other effects livestock production is responsible for about 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions which is more than all the world's Planes Trains and Automobiles put together in fact many scientists believe that reducing meat consumption may be one of the best strategies for managing climate change a vegetarian diet would also greatly reduce water consumption around 70% of global freshwater consumption is used in agriculture it takes 15,000 L to make a kg of beef 6,000 L for pork and 4,000 L for chicken compare this with 1,600 L for cereal crops 900 L for fruit and 300 L for garden vegetables of course a kilogram of meat packs many more calories than the equivalent weight of fruit but even if you compare the ratio of water per calorie of available food energy beef is still five times more water intensive than fruit seven times more than veggies and 20 times more than cereal so are there any downsides to a vegetarian diet Well we'd be left without a cheap source for many byproducts of livestock like leather from animal hides or animal fats which are used in cosmetics candles and detergents and while vegetable-based Alternatives do exist their production would need to increase meaning more land dedicated to growing crops and less restored to its natural state a more complicated fact is that raising and processing animals is a full-time job for more than 1 billion people most of whom are small-scale farmers in the developing World while some may be able to move to producing milk or eggs or even Growing Vegetable crops many would be faced with their way of life becoming obsolete of course any increase in vegetarianism is likely to be a gradual process rather than a sudden cut off and surprisingly the trends are actually in the opposite direction in places like India and China people are becoming wealthier and as a result consuming more meat which effectively cancels out the declines we see in other countries so we actually tried to go vegetarian for 21 days straight as an experiment in our new ASAP thought episode check out the video if you want to see how it went what we learned in the process and how we felt about it both mentally and physically And subscribe for more weekly science videos
