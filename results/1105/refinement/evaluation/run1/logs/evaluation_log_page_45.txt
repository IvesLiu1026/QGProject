To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1895, a physicist named 
Wilhelm Roentgen was doing experiments
with a cathode tube, a glass container in which a beam of
electrons lights up a fluorescent window. He had wrapped cardboard around the tube to keep the fluorescent 
light from escaping, when something peculiar happened. Another screen outside the tube
was glowing. In other words, invisible rays
had passed through the cardboard. Wilhelm had no idea what those rays were,
so he called them X-rays, and his discovery eventually won him
a Nobel Prize. Here's what we now know was happening. When high energy electrons
in the cathode tube hit a metal component, they either got slowed down
and released extra energy, or kicked off electrons
from the atoms they hit, which triggered a reshuffling
that again released energy. In both cases, the energy was emitted
in the form of X-rays, which is a type 
of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than visible light,
and lower energy than Gamma rays. X-rays are powerful enough
to fly through many kinds of matter as if they are semi-transparent, and they're particularly useful 
for medical applications because they can make images of organs,
like bones, without harming them, although they do have a small chance of causing mutations 
in reproductive organs, and tissues like the thyroid, which is why lead aprons are often
used to block them. When X-rays interact with matter,
they collide with electrons. Sometimes, the X-ray transfers all of its
energy to the matter and gets absorbed. Other times, it only transfers 
some of its energy, and the rest is scattered. The frequency of these outcomes depends on how many electrons
the X-rays are likely to hit. Collisions are more likely 
if a material is dense, or if it's made of elements
with higher atomic numbers, which means more electrons. Bones are dense and full of calcium,
which has a relatively high atomic number, so they absorb X-rays pretty well. Soft tissue, on the other hand,
isn't as dense, and contains mostly lower 
atomic number elements, like carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. So more of the X-rays penetrate tissues
like lungs and muscles, darkening the film. These 2-D pictures are only useful
up to a point, though. When X-rays travel through the body, they can interact with many atoms 
along the path. What is recorded on the film reflects
the sum of all those interactions. It's like trying to print 100 pages
of a novel on a single sheet of paper. To see what's really going on, you would have to take X-ray views
from many angles around the body and use them to construct
an internal image. And that's something 
doctors do all the time in a procedure called a CT,
Computed Tomography scan, another Nobel Prize winning invention. Think of CT like this. With just one X-ray, you might be able to see the density
change due to a solid tumor in a patient, but you wouldn't know how deep
it is beneath the surface. However, if you take X-rays
from multiple angles, you should be able to find
the tumor's position and shape. A CT scanner works by sending
a fan or cone of X-rays through a patient to an array of detectors. The X-ray beam is rotated 
around the patient, and often also moved down 
the patient's body, with the X-ray source tracing
a spiral trajectory. Spiral CT scans produce data
that can be processed into cross sections detailed enough to spot 
anatomical features, tumors, blood clots, and infections. CT scans can even detect 
heart disease and cavities in mummies buried thousands of years ago. So what began as Roentgen's happy accident
has become a medical marvel. Hospitals and clinics now conduct over
100 millions scans each year worldwide to treat diseases and save lives.

up to a point, though. When X-rays travel through the body, they can interact with many atoms 
along the path. What is recorded on the film reflects
the sum of all those interactions. It's like trying to print 100 pages
of a novel on a single sheet of paper. To see what's really going on, you would have to take X-ray views
from many angles around the body and use them to construct
an internal image. And that's something 
doctors do all the time in a procedure called a CT,
Computed Tomography scan, another Nobel Prize winning invention. Think of CT like this. With just one X-ray, you might be able to see the density
change due to a solid tumor in a patient, but you wouldn't know how deep
it is beneath the surface. However, if you take X-rays
from multiple angles, you should be able to find
the tumor's position and shape. A CT scanner works by sending
a fan or cone of X-rays through a patient to an array of detectors. The X-ray beam is rotated 
around the patient, and often also moved down 
the patient's body, with the X-ray source tracing
a spiral trajectory. Spiral CT scans produce data
that can be processed into cross sections detailed enough to spot 
anatomical features, tumors, blood clots, and infections. CT scans can even detect 
heart disease and cavities in mummies buried thousands of years ago. So what began as Roentgen's happy accident
has become a medical marvel. Hospitals and clinics now conduct over
100 millions scans each year worldwide to treat diseases and save lives.

**Transcript**:
Death and taxes are famously inevitable,
but what about decomposition? As anyone who's seen a mummy knows, ancient Egyptians went to a lot of trouble
to evade decomposition. So, how successful were they? Living cells constantly renew themselves. Specialized enzymes 
decompose old structures, and the raw materials 
are used to build new ones. But what happens when someone dies? Their dead cells are no longer
able to renew themselves, but the enzymes 
keep breaking everything down. So anyone looking to preserve a body needed to get ahead of those enzymes
before the tissues began to rot. Neurons die quickly, so brains were a lost cause
to Ancient Egyptian mummifiers, which is why, according 
to Greek historian Herodotus, they started the process
by hammering a spike into the skull, mashing up the brain, 
flushing it out the nose and pouring tree resins into the skull
to prevent further decomposition. Brains may decay first,
but decaying guts are much worse. The liver, stomach and intestines
contain digestive enzymes and bacteria, which, upon death, start eating
the corpse from the inside. So the priests removed the lungs
and abdominal organs first. It was difficult to remove the lungs
without damaging the heart, but because the heart was believed
to be the seat of the soul, they treated it with special care. They placed the visceral organs in jars filled with a naturally occurring salt
called natron. Like any salt, natron can prevent decay 
by killing bacteria and preventing the body's natural
digestive enzymes from working. But natron isn't just any salt. It's mainly a mixture 
of two alkaline salts, soda ash and baking soda. Alkaline salts are especially
deadly to bacteria. And they can turn fatty membranes
into a hard, soapy substance, thereby maintaining 
the corpse's structure. After dealing with the internal organs, the priest stuffed the body cavity
with sacks of more natron and washed it clean to disinfect the skin. Then, the corpse was set in a bed
of still more natron for about 35 days 
to preserve its outer flesh. By the time of its removal, the alkaline salts 
had sucked the fluid from the body and formed hard brown clumps. The corpse wasn't putrid, but it didn't exactly smell good, either. So, priests poured tree resin over
the body to seal it, massaged it with a waxy mixture
that included cedar oil, and then wrapped it in linen. Finally, they placed the mummy
in a series of nested coffins and sometimes even a stone sarcophagus. So how successful were 
the ancient Egyptians at evading decay? On one hand, mummies are definitely not
intact human bodies. Their brains have been mashed up
and flushed out, their organs have been removed
and salted like salami, and about half of their remaining
body mass has been drained away. Still, what remains 
is amazingly well-preserved. Even after thousands of years, scientists can perform autopsies 
on mummies to determine their causes of death, and possibly even isolate DNA samples. This has given us new information. For example, it seems that air pollution
was a serious problem in ancient Egypt, probably because of indoor fires 
used to bake bread. Cardiovascular disease was also common,
as was tuberculosis. So ancient Egyptians were somewhat
successful at evading decay. Still, like death, taxes are inevitable. When some mummies were transported,
they were taxed as salted fish.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

Although the options in Question 9 do not exactly match the options in the ground truth MCQ, the question intent and content are similar. Both questions are asking about the health problems or diseases that were common or not common in ancient Egypt, as indicated by the analysis of mummies. 

However, it's worth noting that the ground truth MCQ asks about what disease is NOT common, whereas Question 9 asks about what diseases were common. If there were a generated MCQ that asked about what disease was NOT common, that would be a more exact match. But based on the provided options, Question 9 is the closest match.

**Transcript**:
Death and taxes are famously inevitable,
but what about decomposition? As anyone who's seen a mummy knows, ancient Egyptians went to a lot of trouble
to evade decomposition. So, how successful were they? Living cells constantly renew themselves. Specialized enzymes 
decompose old structures, and the raw materials 
are used to build new ones. But what happens when someone dies? Their dead cells are no longer
able to renew themselves, but the enzymes 
keep breaking everything down. So anyone looking to preserve a body needed to get ahead of those enzymes
before the tissues began to rot. Neurons die quickly, so brains were a lost cause
to Ancient Egyptian mummifiers, which is why, according 
to Greek historian Herodotus, they started the process
by hammering a spike into the skull, mashing up the brain, 
flushing it out the nose and pouring tree resins into the skull
to prevent further decomposition. Brains may decay first,
but decaying guts are much worse. The liver, stomach and intestines
contain digestive enzymes and bacteria, which, upon death, start eating
the corpse from the inside. So the priests removed the lungs
and abdominal organs first. It was difficult to remove the lungs
without damaging the heart, but because the heart was believed
to be the seat of the soul, they treated it with special care. They placed the visceral organs in jars filled with a naturally occurring salt
called natron. Like any salt, natron can prevent decay 
by killing bacteria and preventing the body's natural
digestive enzymes from working. But natron isn't just any salt. It's mainly a mixture 
of two alkaline salts, soda ash and baking soda. Alkaline salts are especially
deadly to bacteria. And they can turn fatty membranes
into a hard, soapy substance, thereby maintaining 
the corpse's structure. After dealing with the internal organs, the priest stuffed the body cavity
with sacks of more natron and washed it clean to disinfect the skin. Then, the corpse was set in a bed
of still more natron for about 35 days 
to preserve its outer flesh. By the time of its removal, the alkaline salts 
had sucked the fluid from the body and formed hard brown clumps. The corpse wasn't putrid, but it didn't exactly smell good, either. So, priests poured tree resin over
the body to seal it, massaged it with a waxy mixture
that included cedar oil, and then wrapped it in linen. Finally, they placed the mummy
in a series of nested coffins and sometimes even a stone sarcophagus. So how successful were 
the ancient Egyptians at evading decay? On one hand, mummies are definitely not
intact human bodies. Their brains have been mashed up
and flushed out, their organs have been removed
and salted like salami, and about half of their remaining
body mass has been drained away. Still, what remains 
is amazingly well-preserved. Even after thousands of years, scientists can perform autopsies 
on mummies to determine their causes of death, and possibly even isolate DNA samples. This has given us new information. For example, it seems that air pollution
was a serious problem in ancient Egypt, probably because of indoor fires 
used to bake bread. Cardiovascular disease was also common,
as was tuberculosis. So ancient Egyptians were somewhat
successful at evading decay. Still, like death, taxes are inevitable. When some mummies were transported,
they were taxed as salted fish.

**Transcript**:
Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians,
are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There's no escape,
except for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards
at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes, 
they'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed 
into the volcano. As it happens, 
all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured
they can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed 
to communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other
during each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would
ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure 
from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees
to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners
under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them 
any new information. What can you say 
to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd, 
"At least one of you has green eyes." The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement
couldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island
seems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning 
after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave
the previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount
of prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things
by imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know, 
that could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other 
still there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen
a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement 
could only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes 
the same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his
or her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning, 
they're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see 
two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others
is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning, 
they still can't be sure. Carl thinks, "If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just 
watching each other, and will now both leave 
on the second night." But when he sees both 
of them the third morning, he realizes they must 
have been watching him, too. Adria and Bill have each 
been going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night. Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat
no matter how many prisoners you add. The key is the concept 
of common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis. The new information was not contained
in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone 
simultaneously. Now, besides knowing at least one
of them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows 
that everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them 
also knows this, and so on. What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one
of the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed
as the number of prisoners on the island. Of course, you could have spared
the prisoners 98 days on the island by telling them at least 99 of you
have green eyes, but when mad dictators are involved,
you're best off with a good headstart.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although the question content and options do not exactly match, Question 4 is the most similar in terms of question intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about the proportion of prisoners with green eyes, and Question 4 asks about the total number of prisoners on the island, all of whom have green eyes. 

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. If a more similar MCQ were generated, it would likely ask about the proportion or percentage of prisoners with green eyes, with options that include the correct answer (100%).

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 8 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks why the prisoners don't know their own eye color, and the correct answer is that there are no reflective surfaces, and they are not allowed to communicate with each other, among other reasons.

Question 8 asks what condition any given prisoner didn't know about themselves, and the correct answer is whether they were one of the green-eyed people the others were keeping track of. While this question is not an exact match, it is related to the prisoners' lack of knowledge about their own eye color.

However, a more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the reasons why the prisoners don't know their own eye color, with options similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Since there isn't a more suitable generated MCQ, I will provide the index of Question 8 as the most similar generated MCQ, with the caveat that it's not an exact match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ based on question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks, "Why don't the prisoners just take a chance and try to leave?" with options related to the consequences of taking a chance. The most similar generated MCQ is not a direct match, but Question 8: "What was the condition that any given prisoner didn't know about themselves?" is not relevant to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ. Question 2: "What was the outcome of the prisoners after the content creator made the statement 'At least one of you has green eyes'?" is not a direct match, but it does relate to the prisoners' actions after receiving new information.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly address the question of why the prisoners don't take a chance and try to leave. If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match.

However, if I must provide an index, I would say that Question 2 is the most similar, although it's not a good match.

**Transcript**:
Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians,
are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There's no escape,
except for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards
at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes, 
they'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed 
into the volcano. As it happens, 
all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured
they can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed 
to communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other
during each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would
ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure 
from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees
to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners
under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them 
any new information. What can you say 
to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd, 
"At least one of you has green eyes." The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement
couldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island
seems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning 
after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave
the previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount
of prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things
by imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know, 
that could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other 
still there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen
a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement 
could only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes 
the same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his
or her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning, 
they're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see 
two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others
is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning, 
they still can't be sure. Carl thinks, "If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just 
watching each other, and will now both leave 
on the second night." But when he sees both 
of them the third morning, he realizes they must 
have been watching him, too. Adria and Bill have each 
been going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night. Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat
no matter how many prisoners you add. The key is the concept 
of common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis. The new information was not contained
in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone 
simultaneously. Now, besides knowing at least one
of them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows 
that everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them 
also knows this, and so on. What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one
of the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed
as the number of prisoners on the island. Of course, you could have spared
the prisoners 98 days on the island by telling them at least 99 of you
have green eyes, but when mad dictators are involved,
you're best off with a good headstart.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1997, 
in a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player
named Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick. With no direct line to the goal, Carlos decided to attempt 
the seemingly impossible. His kick sent the ball flying
wide of the players, but just before going out of bounds,
it hooked to the left and soared into the goal. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move 
in the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it. When Carlos kicked the ball,
he gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent 
goals in the history of the sport? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick
at the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight
in an apparently direct route, with air flowing on both sides
and slowing it down. On one side, the air moved in the opposite
direction to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other side, the air moved
in the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure. That difference made the ball curve
towards the lower pressure zone. This phenomenon is called
the Magnus effect. This type of kick, 
often referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements
that makes the beautiful game beautiful. But curving the ball 
with the precision needed to both bend around the wall
and back into the goal is difficult. Too high and it soars over the goal. Too low and it hits the ground 
before curving. Too wide and it never reaches the goal. Not wide enough 
and the defenders intercept it. Too slow and it hooks too early,
or not at all. Too fast and it hooks too late. The same physics make it possible to score another 
apparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. The Magnus effect was first documented
by Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game
of tennis back in 1670. It also applies to golf balls,
frisbees and baseballs. In every case, the same thing happens. The ball's spin creates a pressure 
differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it 
in the direction of the spin. And here's a question. Could you theoretically 
kick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang 
all the way around back to you? Sadly, no. Even if the ball didn't 
disintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection 
would increase, causing it to spiral into smaller 
and smaller circles until finally stopping. And just to get that spiral, you'd have to make the ball spin
over 15 times faster than Carlos's immortal kick. So good luck with that.

goals in the history of the sport? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick
at the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight
in an apparently direct route, with air flowing on both sides
and slowing it down. On one side, the air moved in the opposite
direction to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other side, the air moved
in the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure. That difference made the ball curve
towards the lower pressure zone. This phenomenon is called
the Magnus effect. This type of kick, 
often referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements
that makes the beautiful game beautiful. But curving the ball 
with the precision needed to both bend around the wall
and back into the goal is difficult. Too high and it soars over the goal. Too low and it hits the ground 
before curving. Too wide and it never reaches the goal. Not wide enough 
and the defenders intercept it. Too slow and it hooks too early,
or not at all. Too fast and it hooks too late. The same physics make it possible to score another 
apparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. The Magnus effect was first documented
by Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game
of tennis back in 1670. It also applies to golf balls,
frisbees and baseballs. In every case, the same thing happens. The ball's spin creates a pressure 
differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it 
in the direction of the spin. And here's a question. Could you theoretically 
kick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang 
all the way around back to you? Sadly, no. Even if the ball didn't 
disintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection 
would increase, causing it to spiral into smaller 
and smaller circles until finally stopping. And just to get that spiral, you'd have to make the ball spin
over 15 times faster than Carlos's immortal kick. So good luck with that.

**Transcript**:
In 1997, 
in a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player
named Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick. With no direct line to the goal, Carlos decided to attempt 
the seemingly impossible. His kick sent the ball flying
wide of the players, but just before going out of bounds,
it hooked to the left and soared into the goal. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move 
in the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it. When Carlos kicked the ball,
he gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent 
goals in the history of the sport? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick
at the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight

**Transcript**:
Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them; We should try hard to get them right. So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful. Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old, which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones. Why not, then, cities? It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance. We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly. It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others. This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities. There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right. 1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered One of the things we really love in cities is order. Order means balance, symmetry and repetition; it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side. Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris. But most cities are a complete mess. When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge. And that's worrying. It's horrible when everything is jumbled up. A pitched roof next to a flat roof, a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park, high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth. We generally have an itch to straighten things out, and when we can't, it's frustrating. The same urge is there when we look at cities. Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city, it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning, like they are increasingly in London, whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love. However, you have to keep something else in mind: excessive order can be just as much of a problem. Too much regularity can be soul destroying. Too much order feels rigid and alien. It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh. So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order. This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic: where every house is the same width and height but within that ordered pattern, every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict: each house has the same height and width, the color range is restricted, but within this grid, each unit is completely individual. We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here. And that's what humans adore. That's what more and more cities should have: order and variety. So as a general rule: too much mess, and it's off putting, but too much simple order, and it's boring. What we crave it's organized complexity which you can see as much here: as here: Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful: they have to have visible life. There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive and in general, we crave the live ones. This is a live street in Hong Kong. This is a live scene in Venice. In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved because they're full of life. There's always plenty going on. In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard. The work sheds are rough, but they're charming. It's fascinating to see what people are up to. How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas? The life of the city is on display, and we're primed to love this. Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities. Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done look dull and dead. They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life. More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away. We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers, connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans. Rather than the old alleyways 
where you can see people at work, look them in the eye as they walk down the road and feel connected to others. Modern planners have become obessed by hiding technology rather than trying to make it nice to look at. Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline was gonna be slapped across a lovely river; we'd be up in arms! But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France. That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness. So let's make sure our streets are full of life, full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows. That's what make certain cities 
so attractive to walk along: the work is on show, the people are proud of what they're doing and happy to let the world notice and appreciate the practical side of things. There's a third principle of good cities: They are compact. In the past, being able to be alone or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement. Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together and it was horrid. As soon as people had money, 
they wanted to move out, and have their own plots. Through the later decades of 20th century, more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm. And it's been a disaster. It's become deadly, cold, and boring, and very, very wasteful on the environment. A compact city like Barcelona swallows a fraction of the energy of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona. We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs connected by sterile wide motorways all because we labor under the false impression that we want to be far away from other people. But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings. That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out. All the most beautiful compact cities have squares. Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline. We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones, but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades. It's not rocket science though. Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home. Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper, you get to be around other people, their moderating, cheering affect is restoring. It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home. There's an art to a good square: it should be neither too big nor too small, anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them, creating a sense of alienation and dislocation. In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square, You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side. The ideal square must offer a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia. There's another principle of good cities to do with orientation and mystery. By definition, cities are huge, but the cities that a lot of people love also have lots of little back streets and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost. We're drawn to the sense of mystery and enclosure that these streets offer. It's actually lovely to get a bit lost. A warren of alleyways can feel homely and intimate. At Cartagena, in Colombia, the balconies nearly touch across the street- you can see your neighbors having breakfast, you know when they've gone to bed, what time the children do their homework on a Sunday evening. The fact that everyone is little bit on display a lot of the time tends to make people nicer. They don't shout at each other quite so much. They put flowers on the table more often. We like it, but we forget that we do, and we don't quite know how to ask for it. Modern planners and developers give us maximum privacy because they suppose that's what we all want, and because they insist that cars and lorries, which like a lot more space than people, are the most important things in the world. Of course we need balance between small streets and big ones. Necessarily, cities are large. We love small streets, but they're a nightmare when you have to go any distance. So the ideal is to have big boulevards, grand, wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets. We need cities that offer us two important pleasures: the pleasures of mystery and the pleasures of orientation. Let's think about scale now. Modern cities are all about big things. Joseph Campbell once wrote: "If you want to see what a society really believes in, look at what the biggest buildings on the horizon are dedicated to". The biggest most prominent things tell us about the actual, rather than admitted priorities of a society. We don't collectively say we worship 
sports shoe corporations, tax specialists, the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals. Our cities, however, tell another story. They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things. That is a bit depressing. As humans, we don't mind things being big, per se, we don't mind being humbled, so long as the things we are bowing to deserve homage, like a beautiful mosque, or a cathedral, or a museum. But we've allowed our cities to be hijacked by aggressive commercial interests, by towers that honor not God, or love, or humanity, but pizza corporations and hedge funds. They exist because we've made a big dumb collective mistake: we focused on who owns land, but we don't think about who owns space, who has air rights. And in the end, who has air rights determines what you can see from your window. We suggest that the ideal height for any city block is five stories high. No more. Above that people start to feel small, insignificant, and trivial. So we say: cut down those towers and pack everything into five stories. Make it dense, compact, and tight, like they do in some parts of Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and Paris, the bits we love. Of course, occasionally there can be a huge building, but let's keep it for something really special, something all of humanity can love. Towers have to be worthy of their prominence, they must be aligned with our best ambitions and long-term needs. Finally, make it local. Somethings should be the same everywhere. We don't expect there to be a uniquely Venezuelan telephone or a distinctively Icelandic bicycle. But, we don't want buildings to look the same everywhere. It's hugely disappointing when you fly somewhere for hours, land, and feel you could be anywhere. The problem isn't just that we like a bit of variation for it's own sake; because of climate, history and social traditions, each society really does have different needs, different strengths and weaknesses. There are many distinct styles of happiness; many good and varied ways of conductive and collective life. The sameness of cities is a problem because it reveals how far each of us must be from engaging with an specific character of it's own place. It's like wearing the same clothes in all climates, or speaking exactly the same way irrespective of who you're talking to. Cities need to have strong characters connected to the use of distinctive local materials and forms. The pale sandstone, of Millbrae Crescent in Glasgow's south side, is a local material, A medium grained, carboniferous, blond sandstone- formed when the Scottish landmass lay near the equator. Or around Cambridge, brick from the local yellowish gault clay is a major traditional material. Or think of the way the great Australian architect, Glenn Murcutt, found ways to put up buildings that reflected the distinctive character Australian life. So the law should be: don't make your city from buildings that could be just anywhere; find a style of architecture that reflects what makes your location specific. The obstacles to building beautiful cities and not economic. Collectively, we've got enough money. We face two main problems: firstly, an intellectual confusion around beauty, and secondly, lack of political will. The intellectual confusion is: we think no one has a right to say what's beautiful and what's ugly; we get worried about who decides; we think beauty is subjective, so surely no one should say anything about it. It's a very understandable qualm, but it's horribly useful to greedy property developers. It's such a relief to these people to learn that there is no such thing as beauty; it means they can get away with murder. We may not agree to the very last point about what a beautiful city is, but we know an ugly one when we see it. No one's ever willingly taken holiday in Frankfurt-on-Main or Birmingham, and there are good reasons for this to do with an objective sense of beauty. So let's stop being dangerously relativistic about this. Yes! There is such a thing as beauty. Sydney and San Francisco and Bath and Bordeaux have it and most other places don't. The proof lies in the tourist statistics. Let's not just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; that's just a gift to the next wealthy idiot who wants to put up a horrible tower. The other obstacle is a lack of political will. We've abandoned the design of cities to the greedy rich. We've given up believing in democracy. We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism. There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development, but we can say no. Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations to keep the greedy, private guys in check. Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town, which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check. They were precise legislation detailing heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline. That's the only way you get beauty. They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos. When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building. We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new, which is wrong because we need places to live. Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905. When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up. The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature. We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions. Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing. Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for. That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of city design and squares.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 5, but it's not a good match. However, I noticed that Question 3 in the transcript mentions the concept of order and variety in city design, which includes the idea of squares. But again, it's not a good match.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to pick one, I would say that Question 5 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

Index: 5 (but not a good match)

Note: I would recommend generating new MCQs that are more specific to the topic of city squares and their design. This would increase the chances of finding a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them; We should try hard to get them right. So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful. Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old, which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones. Why not, then, cities? It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance. We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly. It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others. This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities. There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right. 1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered One of the things we really love in cities is order. Order means balance, symmetry and repetition; it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side. Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris. But most cities are a complete mess. When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge. And that's worrying. It's horrible when everything is jumbled up. A pitched roof next to a flat roof, a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park, high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth. We generally have an itch to straighten things out, and when we can't, it's frustrating. The same urge is there when we look at cities. Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city, it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning, like they are increasingly in London, whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love. However, you have to keep something else in mind: excessive order can be just as much of a problem. Too much regularity can be soul destroying. Too much order feels rigid and alien. It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh. So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order. This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic: where every house is the same width and height but within that ordered pattern, every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict: each house has the same height and width, the color range is restricted, but within this grid, each unit is completely individual. We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here. And that's what humans adore. That's what more and more cities should have: order and variety. So as a general rule: too much mess, and it's off putting, but too much simple order, and it's boring. What we crave it's organized complexity which you can see as much here: as here: Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful: they have to have visible life. There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive and in general, we crave the live ones. This is a live street in Hong Kong. This is a live scene in Venice. In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved because they're full of life. There's always plenty going on. In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard. The work sheds are rough, but they're charming. It's fascinating to see what people are up to. How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas? The life of the city is on display, and we're primed to love this. Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities. Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done look dull and dead. They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life. More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away. We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers, connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans. Rather than the old alleyways 
where you can see people at work, look them in the eye as they walk down the road and feel connected to others. Modern planners have become obessed by hiding technology rather than trying to make it nice to look at. Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline was gonna be slapped across a lovely river; we'd be up in arms! But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France. That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness. So let's make sure our streets are full of life, full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows. That's what make certain cities 
so attractive to walk along: the work is on show, the people are proud of what they're doing and happy to let the world notice and appreciate the practical side of things. There's a third principle of good cities: They are compact. In the past, being able to be alone or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement. Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together and it was horrid. As soon as people had money, 
they wanted to move out, and have their own plots. Through the later decades of 20th century, more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm. And it's been a disaster. It's become deadly, cold, and boring, and very, very wasteful on the environment. A compact city like Barcelona swallows a fraction of the energy of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona. We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs connected by sterile wide motorways all because we labor under the false impression that we want to be far away from other people. But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings. That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out. All the most beautiful compact cities have squares. Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline. We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones, but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades. It's not rocket science though. Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home. Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper, you get to be around other people, their moderating, cheering affect is restoring. It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home. There's an art to a good square: it should be neither too big nor too small, anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them, creating a sense of alienation and dislocation. In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square, You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side. The ideal square must offer a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia. There's another principle of good cities to do with orientation and mystery. By definition, cities are huge, but the cities that a lot of people love also have lots of little back streets and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost. We're drawn to the sense of mystery and enclosure that these streets offer. It's actually lovely to get a bit lost. A warren of alleyways can feel homely and intimate. At Cartagena, in Colombia, the balconies nearly touch across the street- you can see your neighbors having breakfast, you know when they've gone to bed, what time the children do their homework on a Sunday evening. The fact that everyone is little bit on display a lot of the time tends to make people nicer. They don't shout at each other quite so much. They put flowers on the table more often. We like it, but we forget that we do, and we don't quite know how to ask for it. Modern planners and developers give us maximum privacy because they suppose that's what we all want, and because they insist that cars and lorries, which like a lot more space than people, are the most important things in the world. Of course we need balance between small streets and big ones. Necessarily, cities are large. We love small streets, but they're a nightmare when you have to go any distance. So the ideal is to have big boulevards, grand, wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets. We need cities that offer us two important pleasures: the pleasures of mystery and the pleasures of orientation. Let's think about scale now. Modern cities are all about big things. Joseph Campbell once wrote: "If you want to see what a society really believes in, look at what the biggest buildings on the horizon are dedicated to". The biggest most prominent things tell us about the actual, rather than admitted priorities of a society. We don't collectively say we worship 
sports shoe corporations, tax specialists, the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals. Our cities, however, tell another story. They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things. That is a bit depressing. As humans, we don't mind things being big, per se, we don't mind being humbled, so long as the things we are bowing to deserve homage, like a beautiful mosque, or a cathedral, or a museum. But we've allowed our cities to be hijacked by aggressive commercial interests, by towers that honor not God, or love, or humanity, but pizza corporations and hedge funds. They exist because we've made a big dumb collective mistake: we focused on who owns land, but we don't think about who owns space, who has air rights. And in the end, who has air rights determines what you can see from your window. We suggest that the ideal height for any city block is five stories high. No more. Above that people start to feel small, insignificant, and trivial. So we say: cut down those towers and pack everything into five stories. Make it dense, compact, and tight, like they do in some parts of Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and Paris, the bits we love. Of course, occasionally there can be a huge building, but let's keep it for something really special, something all of humanity can love. Towers have to be worthy of their prominence, they must be aligned with our best ambitions and long-term needs. Finally, make it local. Somethings should be the same everywhere. We don't expect there to be a uniquely Venezuelan telephone or a distinctively Icelandic bicycle. But, we don't want buildings to look the same everywhere. It's hugely disappointing when you fly somewhere for hours, land, and feel you could be anywhere. The problem isn't just that we like a bit of variation for it's own sake; because of climate, history and social traditions, each society really does have different needs, different strengths and weaknesses. There are many distinct styles of happiness; many good and varied ways of conductive and collective life. The sameness of cities is a problem because it reveals how far each of us must be from engaging with an specific character of it's own place. It's like wearing the same clothes in all climates, or speaking exactly the same way irrespective of who you're talking to. Cities need to have strong characters connected to the use of distinctive local materials and forms. The pale sandstone, of Millbrae Crescent in Glasgow's south side, is a local material, A medium grained, carboniferous, blond sandstone- formed when the Scottish landmass lay near the equator. Or around Cambridge, brick from the local yellowish gault clay is a major traditional material. Or think of the way the great Australian architect, Glenn Murcutt, found ways to put up buildings that reflected the distinctive character Australian life. So the law should be: don't make your city from buildings that could be just anywhere; find a style of architecture that reflects what makes your location specific. The obstacles to building beautiful cities and not economic. Collectively, we've got enough money. We face two main problems: firstly, an intellectual confusion around beauty, and secondly, lack of political will. The intellectual confusion is: we think no one has a right to say what's beautiful and what's ugly; we get worried about who decides; we think beauty is subjective, so surely no one should say anything about it. It's a very understandable qualm, but it's horribly useful to greedy property developers. It's such a relief to these people to learn that there is no such thing as beauty; it means they can get away with murder. We may not agree to the very last point about what a beautiful city is, but we know an ugly one when we see it. No one's ever willingly taken holiday in Frankfurt-on-Main or Birmingham, and there are good reasons for this to do with an objective sense of beauty. So let's stop being dangerously relativistic about this. Yes! There is such a thing as beauty. Sydney and San Francisco and Bath and Bordeaux have it and most other places don't. The proof lies in the tourist statistics. Let's not just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; that's just a gift to the next wealthy idiot who wants to put up a horrible tower. The other obstacle is a lack of political will. We've abandoned the design of cities to the greedy rich. We've given up believing in democracy. We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism. There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development, but we can say no. Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations to keep the greedy, private guys in check. Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town, which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check. They were precise legislation detailing heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline. That's the only way you get beauty. They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos. When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building. We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new, which is wrong because we need places to live. Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905. When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up. The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature. We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions. Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing. Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for. That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action.

We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism. There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development, but we can say no. Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations to keep the greedy, private guys in check. Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town, which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check. They were precise legislation detailing heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline. That's the only way you get beauty. They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos. When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building. We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new, which is wrong because we need places to live. Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905. When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up. The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature. We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions. Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing. Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for. That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action.

**Transcript**:
Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them; We should try hard to get them right. So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful. Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old, which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones. Why not, then, cities? It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance. We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly. It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others. This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities. There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right. 1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered One of the things we really love in cities is order. Order means balance, symmetry and repetition; it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side. Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris. But most cities are a complete mess. When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge. And that's worrying. It's horrible when everything is jumbled up. A pitched roof next to a flat roof, a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park, high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth. We generally have an itch to straighten things out, and when we can't, it's frustrating. The same urge is there when we look at cities. Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city, it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning, like they are increasingly in London, whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love. However, you have to keep something else in mind: excessive order can be just as much of a problem. Too much regularity can be soul destroying. Too much order feels rigid and alien. It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh. So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order. This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic: where every house is the same width and height but within that ordered pattern, every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict: each house has the same height and width, the color range is restricted, but within this grid, each unit is completely individual. We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here. And that's what humans adore. That's what more and more cities should have: order and variety. So as a general rule: too much mess, and it's off putting, but too much simple order, and it's boring. What we crave it's organized complexity which you can see as much here: as here: Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful: they have to have visible life. There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive and in general, we crave the live ones. This is a live street in Hong Kong. This is a live scene in Venice. In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved because they're full of life. There's always plenty going on. In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard. The work sheds are rough, but they're charming. It's fascinating to see what people are up to. How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas? The life of the city is on display, and we're primed to love this. Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities. Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done look dull and dead. They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life. More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away. We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers, connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans. Rather than the old alleyways 
where you can see people at work, look them in the eye as they walk down the road and feel connected to others. Modern planners have become obessed by hiding technology rather than trying to make it nice to look at. Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline was gonna be slapped across a lovely river; we'd be up in arms! But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France. That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness. So let's make sure our streets are full of life, full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows. That's what make certain cities 
so attractive to walk along: the work is on show, the people are proud of what they're doing and happy to let the world notice and appreciate the practical side of things. There's a third principle of good cities: They are compact. In the past, being able to be alone or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement. Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together and it was horrid. As soon as people had money, 
they wanted to move out, and have their own plots. Through the later decades of 20th century, more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm. And it's been a disaster. It's become deadly, cold, and boring, and very, very wasteful on the environment. A compact city like Barcelona swallows a fraction of the energy of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona. We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs connected by sterile wide motorways all because we labor under the false impression that we want to be far away from other people. But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings. That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out. All the most beautiful compact cities have squares. Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline. We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones, but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades. It's not rocket science though. Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home. Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper, you get to be around other people, their moderating, cheering affect is restoring. It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home. There's an art to a good square: it should be neither too big nor too small, anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them, creating a sense of alienation and dislocation. In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square, You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side. The ideal square must offer a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia. There's another principle of good cities to do with orientation and mystery. By definition, cities are huge, but the cities that a lot of people love also have lots of little back streets and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost. We're drawn to the sense of mystery and enclosure that these streets offer. It's actually lovely to get a bit lost. A warren of alleyways can feel homely and intimate. At Cartagena, in Colombia, the balconies nearly touch across the street- you can see your neighbors having breakfast, you know when they've gone to bed, what time the children do their homework on a Sunday evening. The fact that everyone is little bit on display a lot of the time tends to make people nicer. They don't shout at each other quite so much. They put flowers on the table more often. We like it, but we forget that we do, and we don't quite know how to ask for it. Modern planners and developers give us maximum privacy because they suppose that's what we all want, and because they insist that cars and lorries, which like a lot more space than people, are the most important things in the world. Of course we need balance between small streets and big ones. Necessarily, cities are large. We love small streets, but they're a nightmare when you have to go any distance. So the ideal is to have big boulevards, grand, wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets. We need cities that offer us two important pleasures: the pleasures of mystery and the pleasures of orientation. Let's think about scale now. Modern cities are all about big things. Joseph Campbell once wrote: "If you want to see what a society really believes in, look at what the biggest buildings on the horizon are dedicated to". The biggest most prominent things tell us about the actual, rather than admitted priorities of a society. We don't collectively say we worship 
sports shoe corporations, tax specialists, the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals. Our cities, however, tell another story. They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things. That is a bit depressing. As humans, we don't mind things being big, per se, we don't mind being humbled, so long as the things we are bowing to deserve homage, like a beautiful mosque, or a cathedral, or a museum. But we've allowed our cities to be hijacked by aggressive commercial interests, by towers that honor not God, or love, or humanity, but pizza corporations and hedge funds. They exist because we've made a big dumb collective mistake: we focused on who owns land, but we don't think about who owns space, who has air rights. And in the end, who has air rights determines what you can see from your window. We suggest that the ideal height for any city block is five stories high. No more. Above that people start to feel small, insignificant, and trivial. So we say: cut down those towers and pack everything into five stories. Make it dense, compact, and tight, like they do in some parts of Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and Paris, the bits we love. Of course, occasionally there can be a huge building, but let's keep it for something really special, something all of humanity can love. Towers have to be worthy of their prominence, they must be aligned with our best ambitions and long-term needs. Finally, make it local. Somethings should be the same everywhere. We don't expect there to be a uniquely Venezuelan telephone or a distinctively Icelandic bicycle. But, we don't want buildings to look the same everywhere. It's hugely disappointing when you fly somewhere for hours, land, and feel you could be anywhere. The problem isn't just that we like a bit of variation for it's own sake; because of climate, history and social traditions, each society really does have different needs, different strengths and weaknesses. There are many distinct styles of happiness; many good and varied ways of conductive and collective life. The sameness of cities is a problem because it reveals how far each of us must be from engaging with an specific character of it's own place. It's like wearing the same clothes in all climates, or speaking exactly the same way irrespective of who you're talking to. Cities need to have strong characters connected to the use of distinctive local materials and forms. The pale sandstone, of Millbrae Crescent in Glasgow's south side, is a local material, A medium grained, carboniferous, blond sandstone- formed when the Scottish landmass lay near the equator. Or around Cambridge, brick from the local yellowish gault clay is a major traditional material. Or think of the way the great Australian architect, Glenn Murcutt, found ways to put up buildings that reflected the distinctive character Australian life. So the law should be: don't make your city from buildings that could be just anywhere; find a style of architecture that reflects what makes your location specific. The obstacles to building beautiful cities and not economic. Collectively, we've got enough money. We face two main problems: firstly, an intellectual confusion around beauty, and secondly, lack of political will. The intellectual confusion is: we think no one has a right to say what's beautiful and what's ugly; we get worried about who decides; we think beauty is subjective, so surely no one should say anything about it. It's a very understandable qualm, but it's horribly useful to greedy property developers. It's such a relief to these people to learn that there is no such thing as beauty; it means they can get away with murder. We may not agree to the very last point about what a beautiful city is, but we know an ugly one when we see it. No one's ever willingly taken holiday in Frankfurt-on-Main or Birmingham, and there are good reasons for this to do with an objective sense of beauty. So let's stop being dangerously relativistic about this. Yes! There is such a thing as beauty. Sydney and San Francisco and Bath and Bordeaux have it and most other places don't. The proof lies in the tourist statistics. Let's not just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; that's just a gift to the next wealthy idiot who wants to put up a horrible tower. The other obstacle is a lack of political will. We've abandoned the design of cities to the greedy rich. We've given up believing in democracy. We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism. There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development, but we can say no. Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations to keep the greedy, private guys in check. Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town, which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check. They were precise legislation detailing heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline. That's the only way you get beauty. They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos. When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building. We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new, which is wrong because we need places to live. Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905. When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up. The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature. We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions. Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing. Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for. That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action.

**Transcript**:
Just now, somewhere in the universe,
a star exploded. There goes another one. In fact, a supernova occurs every second
or so in the observable universe, and there is one on average
every 25 to 50 years in a galaxy the size 
and age of the Milky Way. Yet we've never actually been able
to watch one happen from its first violent moments. Of course, how would we? There are hundreds of billions
of stars close enough that we could watch 
the supernova explosion break through the surface of the star. But we'd have to have our best telescopes
focused on the right one at precisely the right time
to get meaningful data. Suffice it to say, the odds of that
happening are astronomically low. But what if we could anticipate 
a supernova before its light reached us? That may seem impossible. After all, nothing travels faster
than the speed of light, right? As far as we know, yes. But in a race, fast doesn't matter
if you take a detour while someone else beelines it
for the finish line. For exactly that reason, photons don't win 
the supernova race to Earth. Neutrinos do. Here's why. There are two types of supernova. Type 1 is when a star accumulates
so much matter from a neighboring star, that a runaway nuclear reaction ignites
and causes it to explode. In type 2, the star runs out 
of nuclear fuel, so the gravitational forces pulling in overwhelm the quantum mechanical 
forces pushing out, and the stellar core collapses under
its own weight in a hundredth of a second. While the outer reaches of the star
are unaffected by the collapsed core, the inner edges accelerate 
through the void, smash into the core,
and rebound to launch the explosion. In both of these scenarios, the star expels an unparalleled
amount of energy, as well as a great deal of matter. In fact, all atoms heavier than nickel,
including elements like gold and silver, only form in supernova reactions. In type 2 supernovae, about 1% of the energy 
consists of photons, which we know of as light, while 99% radiates out as neutrinos, the elementary particles that are known
for rarely interacting with anything. Starting from the center of the star, the exploding matter takes 
tens of minutes, or even hours, or in rare cases, several days, to reach
and break through the surface of the star. However, the neutrinos, 
thanks to their non-interactivity, take a much more direct route. By the time there is any visible change
in the star's suface, the neutrinos typically have a several
hour head start over the photons. That's why astronomers and physicists have been able to set up a project
called SNEWS, the Supernova Early Warning System. When detectors around the world
pick up bursts of neutrinos, they send messages 
to a central computer in New York. If multiple detectors receive 
similar signals within ten seconds, SNEWS will trigger an alert warning
that a supernova is imminent. Aided by some distance and direction
information from the neutrino detectors, the amateur astronomers 
and scientists alike will scan the skies and share information to quickly identify 
the new galactic supernova and turn the world's major 
telescopes in that direction. The last supernova that sent detectable
neutrinos to Earth was in 1987 on the edge of the Tarantula Nebula in the large Magellanic Cloud,
a nearby galaxy. Its neutrinos reached Earth about
three hours ahead of the visible light. We're due for another one any day now,
and when that happens, SNEWS should give you the opportunity
to be among the first to witness something that no human has ever seen before.

**Transcript**:
Just now, somewhere in the universe,
a star exploded. There goes another one. In fact, a supernova occurs every second
or so in the observable universe, and there is one on average
every 25 to 50 years in a galaxy the size 
and age of the Milky Way. Yet we've never actually been able
to watch one happen from its first violent moments. Of course, how would we? There are hundreds of billions
of stars close enough that we could watch 
the supernova explosion break through the surface of the star. But we'd have to have our best telescopes
focused on the right one at precisely the right time
to get meaningful data. Suffice it to say, the odds of that
happening are astronomically low. But what if we could anticipate 
a supernova before its light reached us? That may seem impossible. After all, nothing travels faster
than the speed of light, right? As far as we know, yes. But in a race, fast doesn't matter
if you take a detour while someone else beelines it
for the finish line. For exactly that reason, photons don't win 
the supernova race to Earth. Neutrinos do. Here's why. There are two types of supernova. Type 1 is when a star accumulates
so much matter from a neighboring star, that a runaway nuclear reaction ignites
and causes it to explode. In type 2, the star runs out 
of nuclear fuel, so the gravitational forces pulling in overwhelm the quantum mechanical 
forces pushing out, and the stellar core collapses under
its own weight in a hundredth of a second. While the outer reaches of the star
are unaffected by the collapsed core, the inner edges accelerate 
through the void, smash into the core,
and rebound to launch the explosion. In both of these scenarios, the star expels an unparalleled
amount of energy, as well as a great deal of matter. In fact, all atoms heavier than nickel,
including elements like gold and silver, only form in supernova reactions. In type 2 supernovae, about 1% of the energy 
consists of photons, which we know of as light, while 99% radiates out as neutrinos, the elementary particles that are known
for rarely interacting with anything. Starting from the center of the star, the exploding matter takes 
tens of minutes, or even hours, or in rare cases, several days, to reach
and break through the surface of the star. However, the neutrinos, 
thanks to their non-interactivity, take a much more direct route. By the time there is any visible change
in the star's suface, the neutrinos typically have a several
hour head start over the photons. That's why astronomers and physicists have been able to set up a project
called SNEWS, the Supernova Early Warning System. When detectors around the world
pick up bursts of neutrinos, they send messages 
to a central computer in New York. If multiple detectors receive 
similar signals within ten seconds, SNEWS will trigger an alert warning
that a supernova is imminent. Aided by some distance and direction
information from the neutrino detectors, the amateur astronomers 
and scientists alike will scan the skies and share information to quickly identify 
the new galactic supernova and turn the world's major 
telescopes in that direction. The last supernova that sent detectable
neutrinos to Earth was in 1987 on the edge of the Tarantula Nebula in the large Magellanic Cloud,
a nearby galaxy. Its neutrinos reached Earth about
three hours ahead of the visible light. We're due for another one any day now,
and when that happens, SNEWS should give you the opportunity
to be among the first to witness something that no human has ever seen before.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 5. 

This question is about the percentage of energy released in a Type 2 supernovae that consists of photons, which is closely related to the ground truth MCQ about the percentage of energy from a supernova explosion that is expelled as neutrinos. Although the questions are not identical, they both deal with the distribution of energy in a supernova explosion, making Question 5 the most similar generated MCQ.

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a generated MCQ that exactly matches the ground truth MCQ. If the generated MCQs were modified to include a question that directly asks about the percentage of energy expelled as neutrinos, it would be a more exact match.

None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the overall intent and topic, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present in the list.

However, if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of supernovae, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match. It discusses the different types of supernovae, which is related to the concept of a supernova, but it does not directly define what a supernova is.

Therefore, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3, but with the caveat that it's not a direct match.

It would be more accurate to generate a new MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ, such as:

**Transcript**:
If you ask people whether 
they think stealing is wrong, most of them would answer, "Yes." And yet, in 2013, organizations
all over the world lost an estimated total
of 3.7 trillion dollars to fraud, which includes crimes like embezzlement, pyramid schemes, and false insurance claims. This wasn't just the work
of a few bad apples. The truth is that many people
are susceptible not only to the temptation 
to commit fraud but to convincing themselves
that they've done nothing wrong. So why does fraud happen? While individual motivations 
may differ from case to case, the fraud triangle, a model developed
by criminologist Donald Cressey, shows three conditions 
that make fraud likely: pressure, opportunity,
and rationalization. Pressure is often what motivates someone
to engage in fraud to begin with. It could be a personal debt, an addiction, an earnings quota, a sudden job loss, or an illness in the family. As for opportunity, many people
in both public and private sectors have access to tools that enable them
to commit and conceal fraud: corporate credit cards, internal company data, or control over the budget. The combination of pressure and being exposed to such opportunities
on a daily basis can create a strong temptation. But even with these two elements, most fraud still requires rationalization. Many fraudsters are first time offenders, so in order to commit an act
most would regard as wrong, they need to justify it to themselves. Some feel entitled to the money
because they are underpaid and overworked and others believe 
their fraud is victimless, perhaps even planning to return
the money once their crisis is resolved. Some of the most common types of fraud don't even register as such
to the perpetrator. Examples include employees
fudging time sheets or expense reports, taxpayers failing to report cash earnings, or service providers overbilling
insurance companies. Though these may seem small, and can sometimes
only involve hundreds of dollars, they all contribute to the big picture. And then there's fraud on a massive scale. In 2003, Italian dairy food giant 
Parmalat went bankrupt after it was found to have fabricated
a 4 billion dollar bank account and falsified financial statements to hide the fact that its subsidiaries
had been losing money. Because it was family controlled, corporate governance 
and regulator supervision were difficult, and the company likely hoped 
that the losses could be recouped before anyone found out. And it's not just corporate greed. Governments and non-profits
are also susceptible to fraud. During her time as City Comptroller
for Dixon, Illinois, Rita Crundwell embezzled 
over 53 million dollars. Rita was one of the country's leading 
quarter horse breeders and winner of 52 world championships. But the cost of maintaining the herd
ran to 200,000 dollars per month. Because her position gave her complete
control over city finances, she was easily able to divert money to an account she used 
for private expenses, and the scheme went 
unnoticed for 20 years. It is believed that Crundwell
felt entitled to a lavish lifestyle based on her position, and the notoriety 
her winnings brought to the city. It's tempting to think of fraud
as a victimless crime because corporations 
and civic institutions aren't people. But fraud harms real people
in virtually every case: the employees of Parmalat 
who lost their jobs, the citizens of Dixon whose taxes
subsidized horse breeding, the customers of companies
which raise their prices to offset losses. Sometimes the effects are obvious
and devestating, like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands
of people to lose their life savings. But often they're subtle
and not easy to untangle. Yet someone, 
somewhere is left holding the bill.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 11 is the closest match, as it at least mentions Parmalat and the context of the question is similar.

**Transcript**:
If you ask people whether 
they think stealing is wrong, most of them would answer, "Yes." And yet, in 2013, organizations
all over the world lost an estimated total
of 3.7 trillion dollars to fraud, which includes crimes like embezzlement, pyramid schemes, and false insurance claims. This wasn't just the work
of a few bad apples. The truth is that many people
are susceptible not only to the temptation 
to commit fraud but to convincing themselves
that they've done nothing wrong. So why does fraud happen? While individual motivations 
may differ from case to case, the fraud triangle, a model developed
by criminologist Donald Cressey, shows three conditions 
that make fraud likely: pressure, opportunity,
and rationalization. Pressure is often what motivates someone
to engage in fraud to begin with. It could be a personal debt, an addiction, an earnings quota, a sudden job loss, or an illness in the family. As for opportunity, many people
in both public and private sectors have access to tools that enable them
to commit and conceal fraud: corporate credit cards, internal company data, or control over the budget. The combination of pressure and being exposed to such opportunities
on a daily basis can create a strong temptation. But even with these two elements, most fraud still requires rationalization. Many fraudsters are first time offenders, so in order to commit an act
most would regard as wrong, they need to justify it to themselves. Some feel entitled to the money
because they are underpaid and overworked and others believe 
their fraud is victimless, perhaps even planning to return
the money once their crisis is resolved. Some of the most common types of fraud don't even register as such
to the perpetrator. Examples include employees
fudging time sheets or expense reports, taxpayers failing to report cash earnings, or service providers overbilling
insurance companies. Though these may seem small, and can sometimes
only involve hundreds of dollars, they all contribute to the big picture. And then there's fraud on a massive scale. In 2003, Italian dairy food giant 
Parmalat went bankrupt after it was found to have fabricated
a 4 billion dollar bank account and falsified financial statements to hide the fact that its subsidiaries
had been losing money. Because it was family controlled, corporate governance 
and regulator supervision were difficult, and the company likely hoped 
that the losses could be recouped before anyone found out. And it's not just corporate greed. Governments and non-profits
are also susceptible to fraud. During her time as City Comptroller
for Dixon, Illinois, Rita Crundwell embezzled 
over 53 million dollars. Rita was one of the country's leading 
quarter horse breeders and winner of 52 world championships. But the cost of maintaining the herd
ran to 200,000 dollars per month. Because her position gave her complete
control over city finances, she was easily able to divert money to an account she used 
for private expenses, and the scheme went 
unnoticed for 20 years. It is believed that Crundwell
felt entitled to a lavish lifestyle based on her position, and the notoriety 
her winnings brought to the city. It's tempting to think of fraud
as a victimless crime because corporations 
and civic institutions aren't people. But fraud harms real people
in virtually every case: the employees of Parmalat 
who lost their jobs, the citizens of Dixon whose taxes
subsidized horse breeding, the customers of companies
which raise their prices to offset losses. Sometimes the effects are obvious
and devestating, like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands
of people to lose their life savings. But often they're subtle
and not easy to untangle. Yet someone, 
somewhere is left holding the bill.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 10: Evaluation**

The ground truth MCQ asks about the effects of fraud not being obvious and hard to untangle. Question 10, while not an exact match, touches on a similar theme by asking about the common thread among examples of fraud that affected real people. The correct option for Question 10 mentions a lack of oversight and regulation, which is related to the idea that the effects of fraud can be subtle and difficult to untangle.

However, an even closer match can be found in the options of **Question 14: Synthesis**, which mentions short-term financial losses and reputational damage as a potential consequence of fraud. This question also implies that the effects of fraud can be far-reaching and not immediately apparent.

But the closest match in terms of question intent and content is actually **Question 5: Synthesis**, which asks about potential solutions to prevent or mitigate the effects of fraud. While not directly addressing the ground truth MCQ, it implies that the effects of fraud can be complex and multifaceted, requiring a comprehensive approach to prevent or mitigate them.

Among the generated MCQs, **Question 14: Synthesis** is the closest match in terms of question content, but **Question 5: Synthesis** is the closest match in terms of question intent.

However, upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found an even closer match: **None of the questions directly match the ground truth MCQ, but Question 14 is the closest in terms of content**.



Since it's the closest match in terms of content, I will provide the index of **Question 14**.



The index of the most similar generated MCQ is: **14**

**Transcript**:
Michael Jordan once said, "I don't know whether I'll fly or not. I know that when I'm in the air sometimes I feel like I don't ever
have to come down." But thanks to Isaac Newton, we know that what goes up
must eventually come down. In fact, the human limit 
on a flat surface for hang time, or the time from when your feet leave
the ground to when they touch down again, is only about one second, and, yes, that even includes his airness, whose infamous dunk 
from the free throw line has been calculated at .92 seconds. And, of course, gravity is what's making it
so hard to stay in the air longer. Earth's gravity pulls all nearby objects
towards the planet's surface, accelerating them 
at 9.8 meters per second squared. As soon as you jump,
gravity is already pulling you back down. Using what we know about gravity, we can derive a fairly simple equation
that models hang time. This equation states that the height
of a falling object above a surface is equal to the object's initial height
from the surface plus its initial velocity multiplied by how many seconds
it's been in the air, plus half of the 
gravitational acceleration multiplied by the square of the number
of seconds spent in the air. Now we can use this equation to model
MJ's free throw dunk. Say MJ starts, as one does,
at zero meters off the ground, and jumps with an initial vertical
velocity of 4.51 meters per second. Let's see what happens if we model
this equation on a coordinate grid. Since the formula is quadratic, the relationship between height
and time spent in the air has the shape of a parabola. So what does it tell us about MJ's dunk? Well, the parabola's vertex shows us
his maximum height off the ground at 1.038 meters, and the X-intercepts tell us 
when he took off and when he landed,
with the difference being the hang time. It looks like Earth's gravity
makes it pretty hard for even MJ to get some solid hang time. But what if he were playing an away game
somewhere else, somewhere far? Well, the gravitational acceleration
on our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, is 8.87 meters per second squared, 
pretty similar to Earth's. If Michael jumped here with the same
force as he did back on Earth, he would be able to get more 
than a meter off the ground, giving him a hang time 
of a little over one second. The competition on Jupiter
with its gravitational pull of 24.92 meters per second squared
would be much less entertaining. Here, Michael wouldn't even
get a half meter off the ground, and would remain airborne
a mere .41 seconds. But a game on the moon
would be quite spectacular. MJ could take off from behind half court, jumping over six meters high, and his hang time of over 
five and half seconds, would be long enough for anyone
to believe he could fly.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not an exact match, but Question 4 is the closest in terms of question intent and content.

However, since Question 4 does not specifically address the planet Venus, I also considered Question 8, which mentions Venus but does not provide an equation.

Considering the options and the fact that the ground truth MCQ asks for an equation, I decided to look for an alternative.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that Question 4 is the closest, as it provides an equation that models hang time, which is similar to the equation asked in the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Michael Jordan once said, "I don't know whether I'll fly or not. I know that when I'm in the air sometimes I feel like I don't ever
have to come down." But thanks to Isaac Newton, we know that what goes up
must eventually come down. In fact, the human limit 
on a flat surface for hang time, or the time from when your feet leave
the ground to when they touch down again, is only about one second, and, yes, that even includes his airness, whose infamous dunk 
from the free throw line has been calculated at .92 seconds. And, of course, gravity is what's making it
so hard to stay in the air longer. Earth's gravity pulls all nearby objects
towards the planet's surface, accelerating them 
at 9.8 meters per second squared. As soon as you jump,
gravity is already pulling you back down. Using what we know about gravity, we can derive a fairly simple equation
that models hang time. This equation states that the height
of a falling object above a surface is equal to the object's initial height
from the surface plus its initial velocity multiplied by how many seconds
it's been in the air, plus half of the 
gravitational acceleration multiplied by the square of the number
of seconds spent in the air. Now we can use this equation to model
MJ's free throw dunk. Say MJ starts, as one does,
at zero meters off the ground, and jumps with an initial vertical
velocity of 4.51 meters per second. Let's see what happens if we model
this equation on a coordinate grid. Since the formula is quadratic, the relationship between height
and time spent in the air has the shape of a parabola. So what does it tell us about MJ's dunk? Well, the parabola's vertex shows us
his maximum height off the ground at 1.038 meters, and the X-intercepts tell us 
when he took off and when he landed,
with the difference being the hang time. It looks like Earth's gravity
makes it pretty hard for even MJ to get some solid hang time. But what if he were playing an away game
somewhere else, somewhere far? Well, the gravitational acceleration
on our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, is 8.87 meters per second squared, 
pretty similar to Earth's. If Michael jumped here with the same
force as he did back on Earth, he would be able to get more 
than a meter off the ground, giving him a hang time 
of a little over one second. The competition on Jupiter
with its gravitational pull of 24.92 meters per second squared
would be much less entertaining. Here, Michael wouldn't even
get a half meter off the ground, and would remain airborne
a mere .41 seconds. But a game on the moon
would be quite spectacular. MJ could take off from behind half court, jumping over six meters high, and his hang time of over 
five and half seconds, would be long enough for anyone
to believe he could fly.

Maybe you've recently seen the phrase
"gluten-free" on food packaging, or take-out menus, shampoo bottles,
apartment listings, the tag of your shirt, on a hammer, as a lower back tattoo,
or in your friend's resume. Next time someone starts telling you
about their newfound freedom from gluten, here are some questions you can ask, and the well-informed answers
that your friend, being a reasonable individual
making educated dietary choices, and by no means just following 
the latest diet craze, will tell you. What is gluten? Gluten is an insoluble protein composite made up of two proteins 
named gliadin and glutenin. Where might you encounter gluten? Gluten is found in certain grains,
particularly wheat, rye and barley. What has gluten been doing for
the previous entirety of human history, and why do you suddenly care about it? Gluten is responsible 
for the elastic consistency of dough and the chewiness of foods 
made from wheat flour, like bread and pasta. For some people, 
these foods cause problems, namely wheat allergy, celiac disease,
and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition that occurs when a person's immune system mounts an allergic response 
to wheat proteins, leading to mild problems,
and in rare cases, a potential dangerous reaction
called anaphylaxis. Celiac disease is an inherited disease, in which eating foods with gluten leads to inflammation and damage
of the lining of the small intestine. This impairs intestinal function, leading to problems like belly pain,
bloating, gas, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rash, bone problems
like osteoporosis, iron deficiency, small stature, 
infertility, fatigue and depression. Untreated, celiac disease 
increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Celiac disease is present in one 
in every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S. When blood tests suggest 
the possibility of celiac, the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy. The most effective treatment
is a gluten-free diet, which helps heal intestinal damage
and improve symptoms. Some people don't have celiac disease
or a wheat allergy, but still experience symptoms
when they eat foods with gluten. These people have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity. They experience painful gut symptoms and suffer from fatigue, brain fog,
joint pain or skin rash. A gluten-free diet typically helps
with these symptoms. So how many people actually
have this gluten sensitivity you speak of? Gluten sensitivity's occurrence 
in the general population is unclear, but likely much more common
than wheat allergy or celiac disease. Diagnosis is based 
on the development of symptoms, the absence of wheat allergy
and celiac disease, and subsequent improvement
on a gluten-free diet. There's no reliable blood or tissue test, partly because gluten sensitivity
isn't a single disease, and has a number 
of different possible causes. For example, it may be the case that gluten can activate the immune system
in the small intestine, or cause it to become leaky. But sometimes, people claiming
gluten sensitivity are actually sensitive 
not to wheat proteins, but sugars found in wheat and other foods,
called fructans. The human intestine can't break down
or absorb fructans, so they make their way 
to the large intestine or colon, where they're fermented by bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids
and gases. This leads to unpleasant symptoms
in some people with bowel problems. Another possible explanation behind
gluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect. This occurs when a person believes
something will cause problems, and because of that belief, it does. It's the opposite of the more well-known
and much more fortuitous placebo effect. Given how much bad press 
gluten is getting in the media, the nocebo response may play a role for some people who think
they're sensitive to gluten. For all these reasons, it's clear that 
the problems people develop when they eat wheat and other grains
aren't exclusively due to gluten. So a better name than
non-celiac gluten sensitivty might be wheat intolerance.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that partially matches the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the type of grains where gluten can be found. A partial match can be found in the content of Question 1, which defines gluten and mentions its presence in grains, but it does not explicitly ask about the type of grains.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about the type of grains containing gluten, but such a question is not present in the provided options.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 1, as it provides information about gluten and its presence in grains.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 1

Please note that this is a partial match, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that explicitly asks about the type of grains containing gluten.

**Transcript**:
Maybe you've recently seen the phrase
"gluten-free" on food packaging, or take-out menus, shampoo bottles,
apartment listings, the tag of your shirt, on a hammer, as a lower back tattoo,
or in your friend's resume. Next time someone starts telling you
about their newfound freedom from gluten, here are some questions you can ask, and the well-informed answers
that your friend, being a reasonable individual
making educated dietary choices, and by no means just following 
the latest diet craze, will tell you. What is gluten? Gluten is an insoluble protein composite made up of two proteins 
named gliadin and glutenin. Where might you encounter gluten? Gluten is found in certain grains,
particularly wheat, rye and barley. What has gluten been doing for
the previous entirety of human history, and why do you suddenly care about it? Gluten is responsible 
for the elastic consistency of dough and the chewiness of foods 
made from wheat flour, like bread and pasta. For some people, 
these foods cause problems, namely wheat allergy, celiac disease,
and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition that occurs when a person's immune system mounts an allergic response 
to wheat proteins, leading to mild problems,
and in rare cases, a potential dangerous reaction
called anaphylaxis. Celiac disease is an inherited disease, in which eating foods with gluten leads to inflammation and damage
of the lining of the small intestine. This impairs intestinal function, leading to problems like belly pain,
bloating, gas, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rash, bone problems
like osteoporosis, iron deficiency, small stature, 
infertility, fatigue and depression. Untreated, celiac disease 
increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Celiac disease is present in one 
in every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S. When blood tests suggest 
the possibility of celiac, the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy. The most effective treatment
is a gluten-free diet, which helps heal intestinal damage
and improve symptoms. Some people don't have celiac disease
or a wheat allergy, but still experience symptoms
when they eat foods with gluten. These people have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity. They experience painful gut symptoms and suffer from fatigue, brain fog,
joint pain or skin rash. A gluten-free diet typically helps
with these symptoms. So how many people actually
have this gluten sensitivity you speak of? Gluten sensitivity's occurrence 
in the general population is unclear, but likely much more common
than wheat allergy or celiac disease. Diagnosis is based 
on the development of symptoms, the absence of wheat allergy
and celiac disease, and subsequent improvement
on a gluten-free diet. There's no reliable blood or tissue test, partly because gluten sensitivity
isn't a single disease, and has a number 
of different possible causes. For example, it may be the case that gluten can activate the immune system
in the small intestine, or cause it to become leaky. But sometimes, people claiming
gluten sensitivity are actually sensitive 
not to wheat proteins, but sugars found in wheat and other foods,
called fructans. The human intestine can't break down
or absorb fructans, so they make their way 
to the large intestine or colon, where they're fermented by bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids
and gases. This leads to unpleasant symptoms
in some people with bowel problems. Another possible explanation behind
gluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect. This occurs when a person believes
something will cause problems, and because of that belief, it does. It's the opposite of the more well-known
and much more fortuitous placebo effect. Given how much bad press 
gluten is getting in the media, the nocebo response may play a role for some people who think
they're sensitive to gluten. For all these reasons, it's clear that 
the problems people develop when they eat wheat and other grains
aren't exclusively due to gluten. So a better name than
non-celiac gluten sensitivty might be wheat intolerance.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 8: What are the primary symptoms of non-celiac gluten sensitivity? Options: A. Abdominal pain, B. Fatigue, C. Joint pain, D. All of the above Correct Option: D**

However, a more similar question is:

**Question 18 is not the best match, but Question 8's options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A better match in terms of options would be Question 18 rephrased to match Question 8's options or a non-existing question with the same stem as Question 18 and the same options as the ground truth MCQ.**

Since we do not have an exact match, the closest match would be **Question 8**.

However, another generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 18: What is the name given to the sensitivity to gluten in people who do not have celiac disease or wheat allergy? Options: A. Gluten intolerance, B. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity, C. Wheat intolerance, D. Fructan intolerance Correct Option: B**

If we prioritize the question's content over the options, **Question 18** is a better match.

Given that we have two questions that could match the ground truth MCQ, depending on whether we prioritize the options or the question's content, I will provide both indices:

**Indices: 8 and 18**

However, if I had to choose one index, I would choose **18**, as the question's content is more similar to the ground truth MCQ.

in some people with bowel problems. Another possible explanation behind
gluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect. This occurs when a person believes
something will cause problems, and because of that belief, it does. It's the opposite of the more well-known
and much more fortuitous placebo effect. Given how much bad press 
gluten is getting in the media, the nocebo response may play a role for some people who think
they're sensitive to gluten. For all these reasons, it's clear that 
the problems people develop when they eat wheat and other grains
aren't exclusively due to gluten. So a better name than
non-celiac gluten sensitivty might be wheat intolerance.

**Transcript**:
Maybe you've recently seen the phrase
"gluten-free" on food packaging, or take-out menus, shampoo bottles,
apartment listings, the tag of your shirt, on a hammer, as a lower back tattoo,
or in your friend's resume. Next time someone starts telling you
about their newfound freedom from gluten, here are some questions you can ask, and the well-informed answers
that your friend, being a reasonable individual
making educated dietary choices, and by no means just following 
the latest diet craze, will tell you. What is gluten? Gluten is an insoluble protein composite made up of two proteins 
named gliadin and glutenin. Where might you encounter gluten? Gluten is found in certain grains,
particularly wheat, rye and barley. What has gluten been doing for
the previous entirety of human history, and why do you suddenly care about it? Gluten is responsible 
for the elastic consistency of dough and the chewiness of foods 
made from wheat flour, like bread and pasta. For some people, 
these foods cause problems, namely wheat allergy, celiac disease,
and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition that occurs when a person's immune system mounts an allergic response 
to wheat proteins, leading to mild problems,
and in rare cases, a potential dangerous reaction
called anaphylaxis. Celiac disease is an inherited disease, in which eating foods with gluten leads to inflammation and damage
of the lining of the small intestine. This impairs intestinal function, leading to problems like belly pain,
bloating, gas, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rash, bone problems
like osteoporosis, iron deficiency, small stature, 
infertility, fatigue and depression. Untreated, celiac disease 
increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Celiac disease is present in one 
in every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S. When blood tests suggest 
the possibility of celiac, the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy. The most effective treatment
is a gluten-free diet, which helps heal intestinal damage
and improve symptoms. Some people don't have celiac disease
or a wheat allergy, but still experience symptoms
when they eat foods with gluten. These people have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity. They experience painful gut symptoms and suffer from fatigue, brain fog,
joint pain or skin rash. A gluten-free diet typically helps
with these symptoms. So how many people actually
have this gluten sensitivity you speak of? Gluten sensitivity's occurrence 
in the general population is unclear, but likely much more common
than wheat allergy or celiac disease. Diagnosis is based 
on the development of symptoms, the absence of wheat allergy
and celiac disease, and subsequent improvement
on a gluten-free diet. There's no reliable blood or tissue test, partly because gluten sensitivity
isn't a single disease, and has a number 
of different possible causes. For example, it may be the case that gluten can activate the immune system
in the small intestine, or cause it to become leaky. But sometimes, people claiming
gluten sensitivity are actually sensitive 
not to wheat proteins, but sugars found in wheat and other foods,
called fructans. The human intestine can't break down
or absorb fructans, so they make their way 
to the large intestine or colon, where they're fermented by bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids
and gases. This leads to unpleasant symptoms
in some people with bowel problems. Another possible explanation behind
gluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect. This occurs when a person believes
something will cause problems, and because of that belief, it does. It's the opposite of the more well-known
and much more fortuitous placebo effect. Given how much bad press 
gluten is getting in the media, the nocebo response may play a role for some people who think
they're sensitive to gluten. For all these reasons, it's clear that 
the problems people develop when they eat wheat and other grains
aren't exclusively due to gluten. So a better name than
non-celiac gluten sensitivty might be wheat intolerance.

[MUSIC PLAYING] Getting sick
stinks-- literally. What I mean is that
different diseases give off different odors, and sometimes
doctors can diagnose you based on how you smell. I'm Anna Rothschild, and
this is "Gross Science." So it turns out
that doctors have known since the
time of Hippocrates that different diseases
smell different ways. For example,
typhoid-- which causes fever, abdominal pain,
delirium, and can kill you-- smells like freshly
baked brown bread. Other infections smell
totally differently. The skin of people with
the virus yellow fever is said to smell
like a butcher shop. And if you have a burn wound
infected with the bacteria Pseudomonas, it might
smell like grape juice. But infections from
bacteria and viruses aren't the only
diseases that can make you emit a certain aroma. Genetic conditions--
ones you're born with-- can do the same thing. For example, maple
syrup urine disease, which can be fatal
if untreated, makes you smell like maple syrup. And then there's a condition
called Trimethylaminuria, which has absolutely no
symptoms, except that it makes you smell like rotten fish. And those are just diseases
that humans can smell. Dogs can actually sniff out
certain types of cancer, and scientists have now
created electronic noses. These are smelling
machines that can detect very faint
traces of compounds that the human nose would
never be able to pick up. Beep boop beep. In fact, researchers are looking
into using dogs or e-noses to detect diseases before
they become dangerous. So while sniffing out
the source of an illness has never really
gone away, there's a whole new frontier of

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not exactly match the wording of the ground truth MCQ, it addresses a similar concept. The ground truth MCQ asks whether diseases from bacteria and viruses are the only ones that give off smells, while Question 7 asks about the primary difference between genetic conditions and infections in terms of diagnosis by smell.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks whether diseases from bacteria and viruses are the only ones that give off smells. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 7, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

[MUSIC PLAYING] Getting sick
stinks-- literally. What I mean is that
different diseases give off different odors, and sometimes
doctors can diagnose you based on how you smell. I'm Anna Rothschild, and
this is "Gross Science." So it turns out
that doctors have known since the
time of Hippocrates that different diseases
smell different ways. For example,
typhoid-- which causes fever, abdominal pain,
delirium, and can kill you-- smells like freshly
baked brown bread. Other infections smell
totally differently. The skin of people with
the virus yellow fever is said to smell
like a butcher shop. And if you have a burn wound
infected with the bacteria Pseudomonas, it might
smell like grape juice. But infections from
bacteria and viruses aren't the only
diseases that can make you emit a certain aroma. Genetic conditions--
ones you're born with-- can do the same thing. For example, maple
syrup urine disease, which can be fatal
if untreated, makes you smell like maple syrup. And then there's a condition
called Trimethylaminuria, which has absolutely no
symptoms, except that it makes you smell like rotten fish. And those are just diseases
that humans can smell. Dogs can actually sniff out
certain types of cancer, and scientists have now
created electronic noses. These are smelling
machines that can detect very faint
traces of compounds that the human nose would
never be able to pick up. Beep boop beep. In fact, researchers are looking
into using dogs or e-noses to detect diseases before
they become dangerous. So while sniffing out
the source of an illness has never really
gone away, there's a whole new frontier of
stench science out there. Just take a whiff. Ew. What's the grossest thing
you've ever smelled? Let me know in the comments. And for more "Gross Science"
and weird facts, hit Subscribe.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 7. 

Although Question 7 does not exactly match the wording of the ground truth MCQ, it addresses a similar concept. The ground truth MCQ asks whether diseases from bacteria and viruses are the only ones that give off smells, while Question 7 asks about the primary difference between genetic conditions and infections in terms of diagnosis by smell.

However, a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks whether diseases from bacteria and viruses are the only ones that give off smells. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would choose Question 7, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let us welcome you to the final day of
dramatic battle between great tragedians. It is a spring day here in Ancient Greece. Nearly 17,000 patrons are filing
into the Theatre of Dionysus to watch top playwrights, including favorites Aeschylus
and Sophocles duke it out to see whose hero 
may be deemed most tragic, whose story most awful. Well Seacrestopolis, in last week's battle of the choruses, all 50 members of each playwright's chorus
traveled back and forth across the stage, singing the strophe and antistrophe,
telling misbegotten tales of woe. Today's first chorus is entering 
through the parados, taking their positions in the orchestra
at the bottom of the stage. Mario Lopedokia, this is nothing
we haven't seen before. All 50 members speaking
from the depths of their souls. Wait, what is this? I've not seen this before, Seacrestopolis. There is one actor stepping out
of choral formation, assuming an independent role in this play. Can you make out who it is? That looks like Thespis. It seems he's changing his mask, and taking on the role 
of another character. Incredible. Surely, Thespis will go down
in history as the very first actor. He has changed 
the face of theater forever. And that was just the warm-up act. On to the main attraction. Aeschylus will have the stage first. Let's see what he does. We expect great things. Last competition, 
Sophocles beat him by a smidge, but Aeschylus is still considered
the Father of Tragedy. Now, Aeschylus frequently competes
at this festival, the city Dionysia. Though his plays are violent, the bloodshed is never 
seen by the audience, which allows the dramatic tension
to take center stage. Let's see what he does today
to try to win his title back. Here comes Aeschylus's chorus, but they seem to be missing 
quite a few people. What is going on here? Not only are they down a few people. There are two actors taking center stage. This is absolutely unheard of. He has build on Thespis's idea
and added a second actor to the mix. Aeschylus is relying on 
the two individuals to tell the story. The dialogue possible in tragedy
now has taken precedence over the chorus. No wonder he drastically shrunk its size. This applause is well deserved. The crowd has hushed. Sophocles's actors and chorus are taking the stage for the play,
"Oedipus Rex." As usual, the chorus 
is set up in the orchestra. And what's this? Sophocles has added a third actor. Will this one-upmanship never end? Three actors, and they are changing their masks
to take on several different roles as they weave the tale of Oedipus, a nice fellow who kills his father
and marries his mother. Kills his father and marries his mother. That sounds pretty tragic to me. It is most tragic, Mario Lopedokia. Call me crazy, but I'm willing to bet
that future generations will hold this play up 
as the perfect example of tragedy. Excuse me, Seacrestopolis. Oedipus has left the stage after realizing
Jocasta was his wife and also his mother. Where has he gone? I can't even imagine. Wait. The messenger has stepped on stage and is telling us 
of the great king's actions. He says that Oedipus, upon finding
his mother, wife, whatever, Jocasta, dead of her own hand 
in their incestuous bedroom, took the broaches from her dress
and stabbed his eyes repeatedly. You can't blame the guy, can you? Bedded his mother, killed his father,
is father and brother to his children. I might do the same. My friend, I do believe we've seen it all. Indeed, we have. There is nothing more tragic than Oedipus. And sure enough, the judges who have
been chosen by lot from all over Greece are ready to announce the winner. Oh, folks! This is one 
for the history books. Dark horse playwright, Philocles,
has taken first prize. What an upset. What a tragedy. What a night, folks. We have witnessed the laying
of the foundation of modern theater and some great innovations: the shrinking of the chorus, the addition of three actors, and such catharsis. Doesn't a great tragedy just make you feel
renewed and cleansed? It sure does, but now we are out of time. I'm Seacrestopolis, and I'm Mario Lopedokia. Peace, love and catharsis.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What innovation did Thespis introduce in theater? Options: A. He added a third actor to the chorus, B. He changed his mask to take on the role of another character, C. He stepped out of choral formation to assume an independent role, D. He introduced the use of masks Correct Option: C.

However, the question is not asking about the innovation Thespis introduced but about who is given credit as being the first actor. Question 3 is the closest match because option C describes the action Thespis took, which led to him being considered the first actor.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that directly asks who is given credit as being the first actor. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose from the provided options, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but it's not an exact match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 6: How did Aeschylus's innovation of adding a second actor to the mix affect the dialogue in tragedy? Options: A. It decreased the dialogue possible in tragedy, B. It increased the dialogue possible in tragedy, C. It allowed the chorus to take center stage, D. It had no effect on the dialogue possible in tragedy Correct Option: B**

However, this question does not directly ask who added a second actor to Greek tragedy. A more similar question would be one that directly asks about the innovation of adding a second actor and attributes it to the correct person.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ. However, based on the content and intent of the questions, the closest match would be:

**Question 3: What innovation did Thespis introduce in theater? Options: A. He added a third actor to the chorus, B. He changed his mask to take on the role of another character, C. He stepped out of choral formation to assume an independent role, D. He introduced the use of masks Correct Option: C**

This question is about innovation in theater, but it is about Thespis, not Aeschylus. However, Question 6 does mention Aeschylus's innovation of adding a second actor, so it is also a possible match.

If I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not present, but the closest match would be **Question 6**.

However, I must note that the generated MCQs do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that directly asks who added a second actor to Greek tragedy.

In the interest of providing a response, I will say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 6**.

**Transcript**:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let us welcome you to the final day of
dramatic battle between great tragedians. It is a spring day here in Ancient Greece. Nearly 17,000 patrons are filing
into the Theatre of Dionysus to watch top playwrights, including favorites Aeschylus
and Sophocles duke it out to see whose hero 
may be deemed most tragic, whose story most awful. Well Seacrestopolis, in last week's battle of the choruses, all 50 members of each playwright's chorus
traveled back and forth across the stage, singing the strophe and antistrophe,
telling misbegotten tales of woe. Today's first chorus is entering 
through the parados, taking their positions in the orchestra
at the bottom of the stage. Mario Lopedokia, this is nothing
we haven't seen before. All 50 members speaking
from the depths of their souls. Wait, what is this? I've not seen this before, Seacrestopolis. There is one actor stepping out
of choral formation, assuming an independent role in this play. Can you make out who it is? That looks like Thespis. It seems he's changing his mask, and taking on the role 
of another character. Incredible. Surely, Thespis will go down
in history as the very first actor. He has changed 
the face of theater forever. And that was just the warm-up act. On to the main attraction. Aeschylus will have the stage first. Let's see what he does. We expect great things. Last competition, 
Sophocles beat him by a smidge, but Aeschylus is still considered
the Father of Tragedy. Now, Aeschylus frequently competes
at this festival, the city Dionysia. Though his plays are violent, the bloodshed is never 
seen by the audience, which allows the dramatic tension
to take center stage. Let's see what he does today
to try to win his title back. Here comes Aeschylus's chorus, but they seem to be missing 
quite a few people. What is going on here? Not only are they down a few people. There are two actors taking center stage. This is absolutely unheard of. He has build on Thespis's idea
and added a second actor to the mix. Aeschylus is relying on 
the two individuals to tell the story. The dialogue possible in tragedy
now has taken precedence over the chorus. No wonder he drastically shrunk its size. This applause is well deserved. The crowd has hushed. Sophocles's actors and chorus are taking the stage for the play,
"Oedipus Rex." As usual, the chorus 
is set up in the orchestra. And what's this? Sophocles has added a third actor. Will this one-upmanship never end? Three actors, and they are changing their masks
to take on several different roles as they weave the tale of Oedipus, a nice fellow who kills his father
and marries his mother. Kills his father and marries his mother. That sounds pretty tragic to me. It is most tragic, Mario Lopedokia. Call me crazy, but I'm willing to bet
that future generations will hold this play up 
as the perfect example of tragedy. Excuse me, Seacrestopolis. Oedipus has left the stage after realizing
Jocasta was his wife and also his mother. Where has he gone? I can't even imagine. Wait. The messenger has stepped on stage and is telling us 
of the great king's actions. He says that Oedipus, upon finding
his mother, wife, whatever, Jocasta, dead of her own hand 
in their incestuous bedroom, took the broaches from her dress
and stabbed his eyes repeatedly. You can't blame the guy, can you? Bedded his mother, killed his father,
is father and brother to his children. I might do the same. My friend, I do believe we've seen it all. Indeed, we have. There is nothing more tragic than Oedipus. And sure enough, the judges who have
been chosen by lot from all over Greece are ready to announce the winner. Oh, folks! This is one 
for the history books. Dark horse playwright, Philocles,
has taken first prize. What an upset. What a tragedy. What a night, folks. We have witnessed the laying
of the foundation of modern theater and some great innovations: the shrinking of the chorus, the addition of three actors, and such catharsis. Doesn't a great tragedy just make you feel
renewed and cleansed? It sure does, but now we are out of time. I'm Seacrestopolis, and I'm Mario Lopedokia. Peace, love and catharsis.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about aspects of Ancient Greek theater, and the correct option is "Play-by-play announcers" as the exception. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is about the festival where Aeschylus frequently competed, which is related to Ancient Greek theater. However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar, I would suggest Question 3, which asks about Thespis's innovation in theater. This question is related to Ancient Greek theater and its evolution, but it does not match the ground truth MCQ's intent or options.

However, I must emphasize that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about aspects of Ancient Greek theater and has options that include "Masks worn by the actors," "A competitive component," "Chorus that crosses the stage and helps tell the story," and "Play-by-play announcers" or something similar.

Given the available options, I would suggest:

Index: 3 (with the caveat that it's not a close match)

Please note that this is not an ideal match, and a more suitable generated MCQ would be needed to accurately match the ground truth MCQ.

When you picture a spaceship,
you probably think of something like this, or this, or maybe this. What do they all have in common? Among other things, they're huge
because they have to carry people, fuel, and all sorts of supplies, 
scientific instruments, and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers. But the next real-world generation 
of spacecraft may be much, much smaller. We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny. Imagine sending a swarm of these
microspacecraft out into the galaxy. They could explore 
distant stars and planets by carrying sophisticated 
electronic sensors that would measure everything
from temperature to cosmic rays. You could deploy thousands of them for the cost of a single 
space shuttle mission, exponentially increasing 
the amount of data we could collect about the universe. And they're individually expendable, meaning that we could send them 
into environments that are too risky 
for a billion dollar rocket or probe. Several hundred small spacecraft
are already orbiting the Earth, taking pictures of outer space, and collecting data on things, like the behavior of bacteria 
in the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic signals that could help
predict earthquakes. But imagine how much more we could learn
if they could fly beyond Earth's orbit. That's exactly what organizations,
like NASA, want to do: send microspacecraft 
to scout habitable planets and describe astronomical phenomena
we can't study from Earth. But something so small can't carry 
a large engine or tons of fuel, so how would such a vessel propel itself? For microspacecraft, it turns out, 
you need micropropulsion. On really small scales, some of the familiar 
rules of physics don't apply, in particular, everyday 
Newtonian mechanics break down, and forces that are normally negligible
become powerful. Those forces include surface tension
and capillary action, the phenomena 
that govern other small things. Micropropulsion systems can harness
these forces to power spacecraft. One example of how this might work is called microfluidic 
electrospray propulsion. It's a type of ion thruster, which means that it shoots out
charged particles to generate momentum. One model being developed at NASA's
jet propulsion laboratory is only a couple centimeters 
on each side. Here's how it works. That postage-stamp sized metal plate
is studded with a hundred skinny needles and coated with a metal 
that has a low melting point, like indium. A metal grid sits above the needles, and an electric field is set up
between the grid and the plate. When the plate is heated,
the indium melts and capillary action draws 
the liquid metal up the needles. The electric field tugs 
the molten metal upwards, while surface tension pulls it back, causing the indium to deform into a cone. The small radius of the tips 
of the needles makes it possible for the electric field
to overcome the surface tension, and when that happens, positively charged ions shoot off at
speeds of tens of kilometers per second. That stream of ions propels the spacecraft
in the opposite direction, thanks to Newton's third law. And while each ion 
is an extremely small particle, the combined force of so many of them
pushing away from the craft is enough to generate 
significant acceleration. And unlike the exhaust 
that pours out of a rocket engine, this stream is much smaller
and far more fuel efficient, which makes it better suited
for long deep-space missions. These micropropulsion systems
haven't been fully tested yet, but some scientists think that they
will provide enough thrust to break small craft out of Earth's orbit. In fact, they're predicting that thousands
of microspacecraft will be launched in the next ten years to gather data that today 
we can only dream about. And that is micro-rocket science.

When you picture a spaceship,
you probably think of something like this, or this, or maybe this. What do they all have in common? Among other things, they're huge
because they have to carry people, fuel, and all sorts of supplies, 
scientific instruments, and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers. But the next real-world generation 
of spacecraft may be much, much smaller. We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny. Imagine sending a swarm of these
microspacecraft out into the galaxy. They could explore 
distant stars and planets by carrying sophisticated 
electronic sensors that would measure everything
from temperature to cosmic rays. You could deploy thousands of them for the cost of a single 
space shuttle mission, exponentially increasing 
the amount of data we could collect about the universe. And they're individually expendable, meaning that we could send them 
into environments that are too risky 
for a billion dollar rocket or probe. Several hundred small spacecraft
are already orbiting the Earth, taking pictures of outer space, and collecting data on things, like the behavior of bacteria 
in the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic signals that could help
predict earthquakes. But imagine how much more we could learn
if they could fly beyond Earth's orbit. That's exactly what organizations,
like NASA, want to do: send microspacecraft 
to scout habitable planets and describe astronomical phenomena
we can't study from Earth. But something so small can't carry 
a large engine or tons of fuel, so how would such a vessel propel itself? For microspacecraft, it turns out, 
you need micropropulsion. On really small scales, some of the familiar 
rules of physics don't apply, in particular, everyday 
Newtonian mechanics break down, and forces that are normally negligible
become powerful. Those forces include surface tension
and capillary action, the phenomena 
that govern other small things. Micropropulsion systems can harness
these forces to power spacecraft. One example of how this might work is called microfluidic 
electrospray propulsion. It's a type of ion thruster, which means that it shoots out
charged particles to generate momentum. One model being developed at NASA's
jet propulsion laboratory is only a couple centimeters 
on each side. Here's how it works. That postage-stamp sized metal plate
is studded with a hundred skinny needles and coated with a metal 
that has a low melting point, like indium. A metal grid sits above the needles, and an electric field is set up
between the grid and the plate. When the plate is heated,
the indium melts and capillary action draws 
the liquid metal up the needles. The electric field tugs 
the molten metal upwards, while surface tension pulls it back, causing the indium to deform into a cone. The small radius of the tips 
of the needles makes it possible for the electric field
to overcome the surface tension, and when that happens, positively charged ions shoot off at
speeds of tens of kilometers per second. That stream of ions propels the spacecraft
in the opposite direction, thanks to Newton's third law. And while each ion 
is an extremely small particle, the combined force of so many of them
pushing away from the craft is enough to generate 
significant acceleration. And unlike the exhaust 
that pours out of a rocket engine, this stream is much smaller
and far more fuel efficient, which makes it better suited
for long deep-space missions. These micropropulsion systems
haven't been fully tested yet, but some scientists think that they
will provide enough thrust to break small craft out of Earth's orbit. In fact, they're predicting that thousands
of microspacecraft will be launched in the next ten years to gather data that today 
we can only dream about. And that is micro-rocket science.

**Transcript**:
You probably know the feeling. Your phone utters 
its final plaintive "bleep" and cuts out in the middle of your call. In that moment, you may feel more
like throwing your battery across the room than singing its praises, but batteries are a triumph of science. They allow smartphones 
and other technologies to exist without anchoring us 
to an infernal tangle of power cables. Yet even the best batteries
will diminish daily, slowly losing capacity 
until they finally die. So why does this happen, and how do our batteries even store
so much charge in the first place? It all started in the 1780s
with two Italian scientists, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, and a frog. Legend has it that as Galvani
was studying a frog's leg, he brushed a metal instrument 
up against one of its nerves, making the leg muscles jerk. Galvani called this animal electricity, believing that a type of electricity
was stored in the very stuff of life. But Volta disagreed, arguing that it was the metal itself
that made the leg twitch. The debate was eventually settled
with Volta's groundbreaking experiment. He tested his idea with a stack
of alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper or cloth
soaked in a salt water solution. What happened in Volta's cell is something
chemists now call oxidation and reduction. The zinc oxidizes,
which means it loses electrons, which are, in turn, gained by the ions in
the water in a process called reduction, producing hydrogen gas. Volta would have been shocked 
to learn that last bit. He thought the reaction 
was happening in the copper, rather than the solution. None the less, 
we honor Volta's discovery today by naming our standard unit 
of electric potential "the volt." This oxidation-reduction cycle creates
a flow of electrons between two substances and if you hook a lightbulb 
or vacuum cleaner up between the two, you'll give it power. Since the 1700s, scientists have improved
on Volta's design. They've replaced the chemical solution
with dry cells filled with chemical paste, but the principle is the same. A metal oxidizes, 
sending electrons to do some work before they are regained 
by a substance being reduced. But any battery has a finite 
supply of metal, and once most of it has oxidized, 
the battery dies. So rechargeable batteries give us 
a temporary solution to this problem by making the oxidation-reduction 
process reversible. Electrons can flow back 
in the opposite direction with the application of electricity. Plugging in a charger draws 
the electricity from a wall outlet that drives the reaction 
to regenerate the metal, making more electrons available 
for oxidation the next time you need them. But even rechargeable batteries 
don't last forever. Over time, the repetition of this process
causes imperfections and irregularities in the metal's surface
that prevent it from oxidizing properly. The electrons are no longer available
to flow through a circuit and the battery dies. Some everyday rechargeable batteries will die after only hundreds 
of discharge-recharge cycles, while newer, advanced batteries
can survive and function for thousands. Batteries of the future 
may be light, thin sheets that operate on the principles 
of quantum physics and last for hundreds 
of thousands of charge cycles. But until scientists find a way 
to take advantage of motion to recharge your cell battery,
like cars do, or fit solar panels 
somewhere on your device, plugging your charger into the wall, rather than expending 
one battery to charge another is your best bet to forestall

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 8: What is the primary principle behind the development of batteries?**

Although the question wording is different, the intent and content of this generated MCQ are closest to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the uncertainty of scientists in the 1700s regarding electricity, and the correct option is "What caused electric current to flow." The generated MCQ (Question 8) asks about the primary principle behind the development of batteries, which is related to the flow of electric current.

However, upon re-examining the generated MCQs, I found that none of them perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs focus more on the development of batteries, the experiments of Galvani and Volta, and the principles behind battery operation, whereas the ground truth MCQ focuses on the uncertainty of scientists in the 1700s regarding electricity.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would select **Question 8**. However, I would like to note that the similarity is not very high, and a more accurate match would require a generated MCQ that specifically addresses the uncertainty of scientists in the 1700s regarding electricity.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **8**

**Transcript**:
You probably know the feeling. Your phone utters 
its final plaintive "bleep" and cuts out in the middle of your call. In that moment, you may feel more
like throwing your battery across the room than singing its praises, but batteries are a triumph of science. They allow smartphones 
and other technologies to exist without anchoring us 
to an infernal tangle of power cables. Yet even the best batteries
will diminish daily, slowly losing capacity 
until they finally die. So why does this happen, and how do our batteries even store
so much charge in the first place? It all started in the 1780s
with two Italian scientists, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, and a frog. Legend has it that as Galvani
was studying a frog's leg, he brushed a metal instrument 
up against one of its nerves, making the leg muscles jerk. Galvani called this animal electricity, believing that a type of electricity
was stored in the very stuff of life. But Volta disagreed, arguing that it was the metal itself
that made the leg twitch. The debate was eventually settled
with Volta's groundbreaking experiment. He tested his idea with a stack
of alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper or cloth
soaked in a salt water solution. What happened in Volta's cell is something
chemists now call oxidation and reduction. The zinc oxidizes,
which means it loses electrons, which are, in turn, gained by the ions in
the water in a process called reduction, producing hydrogen gas. Volta would have been shocked 
to learn that last bit. He thought the reaction 
was happening in the copper, rather than the solution. None the less, 
we honor Volta's discovery today by naming our standard unit 
of electric potential "the volt." This oxidation-reduction cycle creates
a flow of electrons between two substances and if you hook a lightbulb 
or vacuum cleaner up between the two, you'll give it power. Since the 1700s, scientists have improved
on Volta's design. They've replaced the chemical solution
with dry cells filled with chemical paste, but the principle is the same. A metal oxidizes, 
sending electrons to do some work before they are regained 
by a substance being reduced. But any battery has a finite

**Transcript**:
There's a common misconception that if you like to meticulously 
organize your things, keep your hands clean, or plan out your weekend 
to the last detail, you might have OCD. In fact, OCD, which stands 
for obsessive compulsive disorder, is a serious psychiatric condition that is frequently 
misunderstood by society and mental health professionals alike. So let's start by debunking some myths. Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic
behaviors are synonymous with OCD. As its name suggests, obsessive compulsive disorder
has two aspects: the intrusive thoughts, images,
or impulses, known as obsessions, and the behavioral 
compulsions people engage in to relieve the anxiety 
the obsessions cause. The kinds of actions that people often 
associate with OCD, like excessive hand washing,
or checking things repeatedly, may be examples of obsessive
or compulsive tendencies that many of us exhibit from time to time. But the actual disorder is far more rare
and can be quite debilitating. People affected have little or no
control over their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which tend to be time consuming and interfere with work, 
school or social life to the point of causing 
significant distress. This set of diagnostic criteria is what
separates people suffering from OCD from those who may 
just be a bit more meticulous or hygiene obsessed than usual. Myth two: the main symptom of OCD
is excessive hand washing. Although hand washing is the most common
image of OCD in popular culture, obsessions and compulsions
can take many different forms. Obsessions can manifest 
as fears of contamination and illness, worries about harming others, or preoccupations with numbers,
patterns, morality, or sexual identity. And compulsions can range from
excessive cleaning or double checking, to the fastidious arrangement of objects, or walking in predetermined patterns. Myth three: individuals with OCD don't understand
that they are acting irrationally. Many individuals with OCD actually
understand the relationship between their obsessions 
and compulsions quite well. Being unable to avoid 
these thoughts and actions despite being aware of their irrationality is part of the reason
why OCD is so distressing. OCD sufferers report feeling crazy for experiencing anxiety 
based on irrational thoughts and finding it difficult 
to control their responses. So what exactly causes OCD? The frustrating answer 
is we don't really know. However, we have some important clues. OCD is considered 
a neurobiological disorder. In other words, research suggests 
that OCD sufferers brains are actually hardwired 
to behave in a certain fashion. Research has implicated 
three regions of the brain variously involved in social behavior
and complex cognitive planning, voluntary movement, and emotional and motivational responses. The other piece of the puzzle is that OCD is associated 
with low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter 
that communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, 
body temperature and pain. But are serotonin and activity 
in these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown
underlying cause of the disorder. We probably won't know until we have a much more intimate 
understanding of the brain. The good news is there are 
effective treatments for OCD, including medications, which increase
serotonin in the brain by limiting its reabsorption 
by brain cells, behavioral therapy that gradually
desensitizes patients to their anxieties, and in some cases, 
electroconvulsive therapy, or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond
to other forms of treatment. Knowing that your own brain 
is lying to you while not being able 
to resist its commands can be agonizing. But with knowledge and understanding
comes the power to seek help, and future research into the brain may finally provide 
the answers we're looking for.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 2: What are the two aspects of OCD, as described in the transcript?**

Although this question does not directly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest match in terms of content and intent. The ground truth MCQ asks about types of obsessions, while Question 2 asks about the two aspects of OCD (obsessions and compulsions). However, none of the other generated MCQs directly address the topic of types of obsessions.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that directly asks about types of obsessions, but such a question is not present in the provided set.

If I had to choose an index, I would choose **2**, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

However, I can suggest a better approach to create a matching MCQ. A generated MCQ that asks "What is an example of a compulsion rather than an obsession?" or "Which of the following is not a type of obsession?" with options similar to the ground truth MCQ would be a more suitable match.

If you can generate more MCQs or modify the existing ones to better match the ground truth MCQ, I would be happy to re-evaluate and provide a more accurate answer.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6. 

Here's why:

- Question intent: Both the ground truth MCQ and Question 6 aim to determine the cause of OCD.
- Options: Although the options are not identical, both questions have options related to the potential causes of OCD. Question 6 has an option "B. Brain chemistry, including low levels of serotonin," which is related to the topic discussed in the transcript. However, it does not have an option that directly states "Still unknown." The closest match is the fact that the transcript mentions that the exact cause of OCD is still unknown, but it does discuss the potential role of brain chemistry and serotonin levels.
- Content: Both questions are related to the cause of OCD, which is a central topic in the transcript.

However, it's worth noting that Question 6 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ with an option that directly states "Still unknown" as the cause of OCD.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the provided options, I would choose Question 6, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
There's a common misconception that if you like to meticulously 
organize your things, keep your hands clean, or plan out your weekend 
to the last detail, you might have OCD. In fact, OCD, which stands 
for obsessive compulsive disorder, is a serious psychiatric condition that is frequently 
misunderstood by society and mental health professionals alike. So let's start by debunking some myths. Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic
behaviors are synonymous with OCD. As its name suggests, obsessive compulsive disorder
has two aspects: the intrusive thoughts, images,
or impulses, known as obsessions, and the behavioral 
compulsions people engage in to relieve the anxiety 
the obsessions cause. The kinds of actions that people often 
associate with OCD, like excessive hand washing,
or checking things repeatedly, may be examples of obsessive
or compulsive tendencies that many of us exhibit from time to time. But the actual disorder is far more rare
and can be quite debilitating. People affected have little or no
control over their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which tend to be time consuming and interfere with work, 
school or social life to the point of causing 
significant distress. This set of diagnostic criteria is what
separates people suffering from OCD from those who may 
just be a bit more meticulous or hygiene obsessed than usual. Myth two: the main symptom of OCD
is excessive hand washing. Although hand washing is the most common
image of OCD in popular culture, obsessions and compulsions
can take many different forms. Obsessions can manifest 
as fears of contamination and illness, worries about harming others, or preoccupations with numbers,
patterns, morality, or sexual identity. And compulsions can range from
excessive cleaning or double checking, to the fastidious arrangement of objects, or walking in predetermined patterns. Myth three: individuals with OCD don't understand
that they are acting irrationally. Many individuals with OCD actually
understand the relationship between their obsessions 
and compulsions quite well. Being unable to avoid 
these thoughts and actions despite being aware of their irrationality is part of the reason
why OCD is so distressing. OCD sufferers report feeling crazy for experiencing anxiety 
based on irrational thoughts and finding it difficult 
to control their responses. So what exactly causes OCD? The frustrating answer 
is we don't really know. However, we have some important clues. OCD is considered 
a neurobiological disorder. In other words, research suggests 
that OCD sufferers brains are actually hardwired 
to behave in a certain fashion. Research has implicated 
three regions of the brain variously involved in social behavior
and complex cognitive planning, voluntary movement, and emotional and motivational responses. The other piece of the puzzle is that OCD is associated 
with low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter 
that communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, 
body temperature and pain. But are serotonin and activity 
in these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown
underlying cause of the disorder. We probably won't know until we have a much more intimate 
understanding of the brain. The good news is there are 
effective treatments for OCD, including medications, which increase
serotonin in the brain by limiting its reabsorption 
by brain cells, behavioral therapy that gradually
desensitizes patients to their anxieties, and in some cases, 
electroconvulsive therapy, or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond

**Transcript**:
In Islamic culture, 
geometry is everywhere. You can find it in mosques,
madrasas, palaces and private homes. This tradition began in the 8th century CE
during the early history of Islam, when craftsmen took preexisting motifs
from Roman and Persian cultures and developed them into new forms
of visual expression. This period of history was a golden age
of Islamic culture, during which many achievements 
of previous civilizations were preserved and further developed, resulting in fundamental advancements
in scientific study and mathematics. Accompanying this was an increasingly
sophisticated use of abstraction and complex geometry in Islamic art, from intricate floral motifs
adorning carpets and textiles, to patterns of tilework that seemed
to repeat infinitely, inspiring wonder 
and contemplation of eternal order. Despite the remarkable complexity
of these designs, they can be created 
with just a compass to draw circles and a ruler to make lines within them. And from these simple tools emerges 
a kaleidoscope multiplicity of patterns. So how does that work? Well, everything starts with a circle. The first major decision 
is how will you divide it up? Most patterns split the circle
into four, five or six equal sections. And each division gives rise
to distinctive patterns. There's an easy way to determine
whether any pattern is based on fourfold, fivefold, or sixfold symmetry. Most contain stars surrounded
by petal shapes. Counting the number 
of rays on a starburst, or the number of petals around it, tells us what category 
the pattern falls into. A star with six rays,
or surrounded by six petals, belongs in the sixfold category. One with eight petals is part
of the fourfold category, and so on. There's another secret ingredient
in these designs: an underlying grid. Invisible, but essential to every pattern, the grid helps determine the scale
of the composition before work begins, keeps the pattern accurate, and facilitates the invention 
of incredible new patterns. Let's look at an example of how these
elements come together. We'll start with a circle within a square,
and divide it into eight equal parts. We can then draw a pair
of criss-crossing lines and overlay them with another two. These lines are called construction lines, and by choosing a set of their segments, we'll form the basis 
of our repeating pattern. Many different designs are possible
from the same construction lines just by picking different segments. And the full pattern finally emerges when we create a grid with many
repetitions of this one tile in a process called tessellation. By choosing a different set 
of construction lines, we might have created this pattern, or this one. The possibilities are virtually endless. We can follow the same steps
to create sixfold patterns by drawing construction lines
over a circle divided into six parts, and then tessellating it,
we can make something like this. Here's another sixfold pattern
that has appeared across the centuries and all over the Islamic world, including Marrakesh, Agra, Konya
and the Alhambra. Fourfold patterns fit in a square grid,
and sixfold patterns in a hexagonal grid. Fivefold patterns, however,
are more challenging to tessellate because pentagons 
don't neatly fill a surface, so instead of just creating 
a pattern in a pentagon, other shapes have to be added
to make something that is repeatable, resulting in patterns that may seem
confoundingly complex, but are still relatively simple to create. Also, tessellation is not constrained
to simple geometric shapes, as M.C. Escher's work demonstrates. And while the Islamic 
geometric design tradition doesn't tend to employ elements 
like fish and faces, it does sometimes make use of multiple 
shapes to craft complex patterns. This more than 1,000-year-old tradition
has wielded basic geometry to produce works that are intricate,
decorative and pleasing to the eye. And these craftsmen prove just how
much is possible with some artistic intuition, creativity,
dedication and a great compass and ruler.

In Islamic culture, 
geometry is everywhere. You can find it in mosques,
madrasas, palaces and private homes. This tradition began in the 8th century CE
during the early history of Islam, when craftsmen took preexisting motifs
from Roman and Persian cultures and developed them into new forms
of visual expression. This period of history was a golden age
of Islamic culture, during which many achievements 
of previous civilizations were preserved and further developed, resulting in fundamental advancements
in scientific study and mathematics. Accompanying this was an increasingly
sophisticated use of abstraction and complex geometry in Islamic art, from intricate floral motifs
adorning carpets and textiles, to patterns of tilework that seemed
to repeat infinitely, inspiring wonder 
and contemplation of eternal order. Despite the remarkable complexity
of these designs, they can be created 
with just a compass to draw circles and a ruler to make lines within them. And from these simple tools emerges 
a kaleidoscope multiplicity of patterns. So how does that work? Well, everything starts with a circle. The first major decision 
is how will you divide it up? Most patterns split the circle
into four, five or six equal sections. And each division gives rise
to distinctive patterns. There's an easy way to determine
whether any pattern is based on fourfold, fivefold, or sixfold symmetry. Most contain stars surrounded
by petal shapes. Counting the number 
of rays on a starburst, or the number of petals around it, tells us what category 
the pattern falls into. A star with six rays,
or surrounded by six petals, belongs in the sixfold category. One with eight petals is part
of the fourfold category, and so on. There's another secret ingredient
in these designs: an underlying grid. Invisible, but essential to every pattern, the grid helps determine the scale
of the composition before work begins, keeps the pattern accurate, and facilitates the invention 
of incredible new patterns. Let's look at an example of how these
elements come together. We'll start with a circle within a square,
and divide it into eight equal parts. We can then draw a pair
of criss-crossing lines and overlay them with another two. These lines are called construction lines, and by choosing a set of their segments, we'll form the basis 
of our repeating pattern. Many different designs are possible
from the same construction lines just by picking different segments. And the full pattern finally emerges when we create a grid with many
repetitions of this one tile in a process called tessellation. By choosing a different set 
of construction lines, we might have created this pattern, or this one. The possibilities are virtually endless. We can follow the same steps
to create sixfold patterns by drawing construction lines
over a circle divided into six parts, and then tessellating it,
we can make something like this. Here's another sixfold pattern
that has appeared across the centuries and all over the Islamic world, including Marrakesh, Agra, Konya
and the Alhambra. Fourfold patterns fit in a square grid,
and sixfold patterns in a hexagonal grid. Fivefold patterns, however,
are more challenging to tessellate because pentagons 
don't neatly fill a surface, so instead of just creating 
a pattern in a pentagon, other shapes have to be added
to make something that is repeatable, resulting in patterns that may seem
confoundingly complex, but are still relatively simple to create. Also, tessellation is not constrained
to simple geometric shapes, as M.C. Escher's work demonstrates. And while the Islamic 
geometric design tradition doesn't tend to employ elements 
like fish and faces, it does sometimes make use of multiple 
shapes to craft complex patterns. This more than 1,000-year-old tradition
has wielded basic geometry to produce works that are intricate,
decorative and pleasing to the eye. And these craftsmen prove just how
much is possible with some artistic intuition, creativity,
dedication and a great compass and ruler.

**Transcript**:
In 1895, a physicist named 
Wilhelm Roentgen was doing experiments
with a cathode tube, a glass container in which a beam of
electrons lights up a fluorescent window. He had wrapped cardboard around the tube to keep the fluorescent 
light from escaping, when something peculiar happened. Another screen outside the tube
was glowing. In other words, invisible rays
had passed through the cardboard. Wilhelm had no idea what those rays were,
so he called them X-rays, and his discovery eventually won him
a Nobel Prize. Here's what we now know was happening. When high energy electrons
in the cathode tube hit a metal component, they either got slowed down
and released extra energy, or kicked off electrons
from the atoms they hit, which triggered a reshuffling
that again released energy. In both cases, the energy was emitted
in the form of X-rays, which is a type 
of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than visible light,
and lower energy than Gamma rays. X-rays are powerful enough
to fly through many kinds of matter as if they are semi-transparent, and they're particularly useful 
for medical applications because they can make images of organs,
like bones, without harming them, although they do have a small chance of causing mutations 
in reproductive organs, and tissues like the thyroid, which is why lead aprons are often
used to block them. When X-rays interact with matter,
they collide with electrons. Sometimes, the X-ray transfers all of its
energy to the matter and gets absorbed. Other times, it only transfers 
some of its energy, and the rest is scattered. The frequency of these outcomes depends on how many electrons
the X-rays are likely to hit. Collisions are more likely 
if a material is dense, or if it's made of elements
with higher atomic numbers, which means more electrons. Bones are dense and full of calcium,
which has a relatively high atomic number, so they absorb X-rays pretty well. Soft tissue, on the other hand,
isn't as dense, and contains mostly lower 
atomic number elements, like carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. So more of the X-rays penetrate tissues
like lungs and muscles, darkening the film. These 2-D pictures are only useful
up to a point, though. When X-rays travel through the body, they can interact with many atoms 
along the path. What is recorded on the film reflects
the sum of all those interactions. It's like trying to print 100 pages
of a novel on a single sheet of paper. To see what's really going on, you would have to take X-ray views
from many angles around the body and use them to construct
an internal image. And that's something 
doctors do all the time in a procedure called a CT,
Computed Tomography scan, another Nobel Prize winning invention. Think of CT like this. With just one X-ray, you might be able to see the density
change due to a solid tumor in a patient, but you wouldn't know how deep
it is beneath the surface. However, if you take X-rays
from multiple angles, you should be able to find
the tumor's position and shape. A CT scanner works by sending
a fan or cone of X-rays through a patient to an array of detectors. The X-ray beam is rotated 
around the patient, and often also moved down 
the patient's body, with the X-ray source tracing
a spiral trajectory. Spiral CT scans produce data
that can be processed into cross sections detailed enough to spot 
anatomical features, tumors, blood clots, and infections. CT scans can even detect 
heart disease and cavities in mummies buried thousands of years ago. So what began as Roentgen's happy accident
has become a medical marvel. Hospitals and clinics now conduct over
100 millions scans each year worldwide to treat diseases and save lives.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1895, a physicist named 
Wilhelm Roentgen was doing experiments
with a cathode tube, a glass container in which a beam of
electrons lights up a fluorescent window. He had wrapped cardboard around the tube to keep the fluorescent 
light from escaping, when something peculiar happened. Another screen outside the tube
was glowing. In other words, invisible rays
had passed through the cardboard. Wilhelm had no idea what those rays were,
so he called them X-rays, and his discovery eventually won him
a Nobel Prize. Here's what we now know was happening. When high energy electrons
in the cathode tube hit a metal component, they either got slowed down
and released extra energy, or kicked off electrons
from the atoms they hit, which triggered a reshuffling
that again released energy. In both cases, the energy was emitted
in the form of X-rays, which is a type 
of electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than visible light,
and lower energy than Gamma rays. X-rays are powerful enough
to fly through many kinds of matter as if they are semi-transparent, and they're particularly useful 
for medical applications because they can make images of organs,
like bones, without harming them, although they do have a small chance of causing mutations 
in reproductive organs, and tissues like the thyroid, which is why lead aprons are often
used to block them. When X-rays interact with matter,
they collide with electrons. Sometimes, the X-ray transfers all of its
energy to the matter and gets absorbed. Other times, it only transfers 
some of its energy, and the rest is scattered. The frequency of these outcomes depends on how many electrons
the X-rays are likely to hit. Collisions are more likely 
if a material is dense, or if it's made of elements
with higher atomic numbers, which means more electrons. Bones are dense and full of calcium,
which has a relatively high atomic number, so they absorb X-rays pretty well. Soft tissue, on the other hand,
isn't as dense, and contains mostly lower 
atomic number elements, like carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. So more of the X-rays penetrate tissues
like lungs and muscles, darkening the film. These 2-D pictures are only useful
up to a point, though. When X-rays travel through the body, they can interact with many atoms 
along the path. What is recorded on the film reflects
the sum of all those interactions. It's like trying to print 100 pages
of a novel on a single sheet of paper. To see what's really going on, you would have to take X-ray views
from many angles around the body and use them to construct
an internal image. And that's something 
doctors do all the time in a procedure called a CT,
Computed Tomography scan, another Nobel Prize winning invention. Think of CT like this. With just one X-ray, you might be able to see the density
change due to a solid tumor in a patient, but you wouldn't know how deep
it is beneath the surface. However, if you take X-rays
from multiple angles, you should be able to find
the tumor's position and shape. A CT scanner works by sending
a fan or cone of X-rays through a patient to an array of detectors. The X-ray beam is rotated 
around the patient, and often also moved down 
the patient's body, with the X-ray source tracing
a spiral trajectory. Spiral CT scans produce data
that can be processed into cross sections detailed enough to spot 
anatomical features, tumors, blood clots, and infections. CT scans can even detect 
heart disease and cavities in mummies buried thousands of years ago. So what began as Roentgen's happy accident
has become a medical marvel. Hospitals and clinics now conduct over
100 millions scans each year worldwide to treat diseases and save lives.

**Transcript**:
Death and taxes are famously inevitable,
but what about decomposition? As anyone who's seen a mummy knows, ancient Egyptians went to a lot of trouble
to evade decomposition. So, how successful were they? Living cells constantly renew themselves. Specialized enzymes 
decompose old structures, and the raw materials 
are used to build new ones. But what happens when someone dies? Their dead cells are no longer
able to renew themselves, but the enzymes 
keep breaking everything down. So anyone looking to preserve a body needed to get ahead of those enzymes
before the tissues began to rot. Neurons die quickly, so brains were a lost cause
to Ancient Egyptian mummifiers, which is why, according 
to Greek historian Herodotus, they started the process
by hammering a spike into the skull, mashing up the brain, 
flushing it out the nose and pouring tree resins into the skull
to prevent further decomposition. Brains may decay first,
but decaying guts are much worse. The liver, stomach and intestines
contain digestive enzymes and bacteria, which, upon death, start eating
the corpse from the inside. So the priests removed the lungs
and abdominal organs first. It was difficult to remove the lungs
without damaging the heart, but because the heart was believed
to be the seat of the soul, they treated it with special care. They placed the visceral organs in jars filled with a naturally occurring salt
called natron. Like any salt, natron can prevent decay 
by killing bacteria and preventing the body's natural
digestive enzymes from working. But natron isn't just any salt. It's mainly a mixture 
of two alkaline salts, soda ash and baking soda. Alkaline salts are especially
deadly to bacteria. And they can turn fatty membranes
into a hard, soapy substance, thereby maintaining 
the corpse's structure. After dealing with the internal organs, the priest stuffed the body cavity
with sacks of more natron and washed it clean to disinfect the skin. Then, the corpse was set in a bed
of still more natron for about 35 days 
to preserve its outer flesh. By the time of its removal, the alkaline salts 
had sucked the fluid from the body and formed hard brown clumps. The corpse wasn't putrid, but it didn't exactly smell good, either. So, priests poured tree resin over
the body to seal it, massaged it with a waxy mixture
that included cedar oil, and then wrapped it in linen. Finally, they placed the mummy
in a series of nested coffins and sometimes even a stone sarcophagus. So how successful were 
the ancient Egyptians at evading decay? On one hand, mummies are definitely not
intact human bodies. Their brains have been mashed up
and flushed out, their organs have been removed
and salted like salami, and about half of their remaining
body mass has been drained away. Still, what remains 
is amazingly well-preserved. Even after thousands of years, scientists can perform autopsies

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Death and taxes are famously inevitable,
but what about decomposition? As anyone who's seen a mummy knows, ancient Egyptians went to a lot of trouble
to evade decomposition. So, how successful were they? Living cells constantly renew themselves. Specialized enzymes 
decompose old structures, and the raw materials 
are used to build new ones. But what happens when someone dies? Their dead cells are no longer
able to renew themselves, but the enzymes 
keep breaking everything down. So anyone looking to preserve a body needed to get ahead of those enzymes
before the tissues began to rot. Neurons die quickly, so brains were a lost cause
to Ancient Egyptian mummifiers, which is why, according 
to Greek historian Herodotus, they started the process
by hammering a spike into the skull, mashing up the brain, 
flushing it out the nose and pouring tree resins into the skull
to prevent further decomposition. Brains may decay first,
but decaying guts are much worse. The liver, stomach and intestines
contain digestive enzymes and bacteria, which, upon death, start eating
the corpse from the inside. So the priests removed the lungs
and abdominal organs first. It was difficult to remove the lungs
without damaging the heart, but because the heart was believed
to be the seat of the soul, they treated it with special care. They placed the visceral organs in jars filled with a naturally occurring salt
called natron. Like any salt, natron can prevent decay 
by killing bacteria and preventing the body's natural
digestive enzymes from working. But natron isn't just any salt. It's mainly a mixture 
of two alkaline salts, soda ash and baking soda. Alkaline salts are especially
deadly to bacteria. And they can turn fatty membranes
into a hard, soapy substance, thereby maintaining 
the corpse's structure. After dealing with the internal organs, the priest stuffed the body cavity
with sacks of more natron and washed it clean to disinfect the skin. Then, the corpse was set in a bed
of still more natron for about 35 days 
to preserve its outer flesh. By the time of its removal, the alkaline salts 
had sucked the fluid from the body and formed hard brown clumps. The corpse wasn't putrid, but it didn't exactly smell good, either. So, priests poured tree resin over
the body to seal it, massaged it with a waxy mixture
that included cedar oil, and then wrapped it in linen. Finally, they placed the mummy
in a series of nested coffins and sometimes even a stone sarcophagus. So how successful were 
the ancient Egyptians at evading decay? On one hand, mummies are definitely not
intact human bodies. Their brains have been mashed up
and flushed out, their organs have been removed
and salted like salami, and about half of their remaining
body mass has been drained away. Still, what remains 
is amazingly well-preserved. Even after thousands of years, scientists can perform autopsies 
on mummies to determine their causes of death, and possibly even isolate DNA samples. This has given us new information. For example, it seems that air pollution
was a serious problem in ancient Egypt, probably because of indoor fires 
used to bake bread. Cardiovascular disease was also common,
as was tuberculosis. So ancient Egyptians were somewhat
successful at evading decay. Still, like death, taxes are inevitable. When some mummies were transported,
they were taxed as salted fish.

**Transcript**:
Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians,
are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There's no escape,
except for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards
at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes, 
they'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed 
into the volcano. As it happens, 
all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured
they can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed 
to communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other
during each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would
ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure 
from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees
to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners
under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them 
any new information. What can you say 
to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd, 
"At least one of you has green eyes." The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement
couldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island
seems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning 
after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave
the previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount
of prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things
by imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know, 
that could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other 
still there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen
a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement 
could only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes 
the same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his
or her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning, 
they're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see 
two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others
is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning, 
they still can't be sure. Carl thinks, "If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just 
watching each other, and will now both leave 
on the second night." But when he sees both 
of them the third morning, he realizes they must 
have been watching him, too. Adria and Bill have each 
been going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night. Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat
no matter how many prisoners you add. The key is the concept 
of common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis. The new information was not contained
in your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone 
simultaneously. Now, besides knowing at least one
of them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows 
that everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them 
also knows this, and so on. What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one
of the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed
as the number of prisoners on the island. Of course, you could have spared
the prisoners 98 days on the island by telling them at least 99 of you
have green eyes, but when mad dictators are involved,
you're best off with a good headstart.

**Transcript**:
Imagine an island where 100 people, all perfect logicians,
are imprisoned by a mad dictator. There's no escape,
except for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards
at night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes, 
they'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed 
into the volcano. As it happens, 
all 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured
they can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed 
to communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other
during each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would
ever risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure 
from human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees
to let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners
under the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them 
any new information. What can you say 
to help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd, 
"At least one of you has green eyes." The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement
couldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island
seems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning 
after your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave
the previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount
of prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things
by imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know, 
that could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other 
still there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen
a non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement 
could only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes 
the same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his
or her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning, 
they're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see 
two green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others
is also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning, 
they still can't be sure. Carl thinks, "If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1997, 
in a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player
named Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick. With no direct line to the goal, Carlos decided to attempt 
the seemingly impossible. His kick sent the ball flying
wide of the players, but just before going out of bounds,
it hooked to the left and soared into the goal. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move 
in the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it. When Carlos kicked the ball,
he gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent 
goals in the history of the sport? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick
at the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight
in an apparently direct route, with air flowing on both sides
and slowing it down. On one side, the air moved in the opposite
direction to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other side, the air moved
in the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure. That difference made the ball curve
towards the lower pressure zone. This phenomenon is called
the Magnus effect. This type of kick, 
often referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements
that makes the beautiful game beautiful. But curving the ball 
with the precision needed to both bend around the wall
and back into the goal is difficult. Too high and it soars over the goal. Too low and it hits the ground 
before curving. Too wide and it never reaches the goal. Not wide enough 
and the defenders intercept it. Too slow and it hooks too early,
or not at all. Too fast and it hooks too late. The same physics make it possible to score another 
apparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. The Magnus effect was first documented
by Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game
of tennis back in 1670. It also applies to golf balls,
frisbees and baseballs. In every case, the same thing happens. The ball's spin creates a pressure 
differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it 
in the direction of the spin. And here's a question. Could you theoretically 
kick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang 
all the way around back to you? Sadly, no. Even if the ball didn't 
disintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection 
would increase, causing it to spiral into smaller 
and smaller circles until finally stopping. And just to get that spiral, you'd have to make the ball spin
over 15 times faster than Carlos's immortal kick. So good luck with that.

**Transcript**:
In 1997, 
in a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player
named Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick. With no direct line to the goal, Carlos decided to attempt 
the seemingly impossible. His kick sent the ball flying
wide of the players, but just before going out of bounds,
it hooked to the left and soared into the goal. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move 
in the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it. When Carlos kicked the ball,
he gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent 
goals in the history of the sport? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick
at the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right,
but also rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight
in an apparently direct route, with air flowing on both sides
and slowing it down. On one side, the air moved in the opposite
direction to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other side, the air moved
in the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure. That difference made the ball curve
towards the lower pressure zone. This phenomenon is called
the Magnus effect. This type of kick, 
often referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements
that makes the beautiful game beautiful. But curving the ball 
with the precision needed to both bend around the wall
and back into the goal is difficult. Too high and it soars over the goal. Too low and it hits the ground 
before curving. Too wide and it never reaches the goal. Not wide enough 
and the defenders intercept it. Too slow and it hooks too early,
or not at all. Too fast and it hooks too late. The same physics make it possible to score another 
apparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. The Magnus effect was first documented
by Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game
of tennis back in 1670. It also applies to golf balls,
frisbees and baseballs. In every case, the same thing happens. The ball's spin creates a pressure 
differential in the surrounding air flow that curves it 
in the direction of the spin. And here's a question. Could you theoretically 
kick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang 
all the way around back to you? Sadly, no. Even if the ball didn't 
disintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection 
would increase, causing it to spiral into smaller 
and smaller circles until finally stopping. And just to get that spiral, you'd have to make the ball spin
over 15 times faster than Carlos's immortal kick. So good luck with that.

**Transcript**:
Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them; We should try hard to get them right. So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful. Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old, which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones. Why not, then, cities? It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance. We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly. It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others. This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities. There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right. 1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered One of the things we really love in cities is order. Order means balance, symmetry and repetition; it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side. Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris. But most cities are a complete mess. When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge. And that's worrying. It's horrible when everything is jumbled up. A pitched roof next to a flat roof, a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park, high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth. We generally have an itch to straighten things out, and when we can't, it's frustrating. The same urge is there when we look at cities. Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city, it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning, like they are increasingly in London, whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love. However, you have to keep something else in mind: excessive order can be just as much of a problem. Too much regularity can be soul destroying. Too much order feels rigid and alien. It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh. So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order. This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic: where every house is the same width and height but within that ordered pattern, every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict: each house has the same height and width, the color range is restricted, but within this grid, each unit is completely individual. We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here. And that's what humans adore. That's what more and more cities should have: order and variety. So as a general rule: too much mess, and it's off putting, but too much simple order, and it's boring. What we crave it's organized complexity which you can see as much here: as here: Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful: they have to have visible life. There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive and in general, we crave the live ones. This is a live street in Hong Kong. This is a live scene in Venice. In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved because they're full of life. There's always plenty going on. In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard. The work sheds are rough, but they're charming. It's fascinating to see what people are up to. How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas? The life of the city is on display, and we're primed to love this. Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities. Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done look dull and dead. They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life. More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away. We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers, connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans. Rather than the old alleyways 
where you can see people at work, look them in the eye as they walk down the road and feel connected to others. Modern planners have become obessed by hiding technology rather than trying to make it nice to look at. Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline was gonna be slapped across a lovely river; we'd be up in arms! But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France. That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness. So let's make sure our streets are full of life, full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows. That's what make certain cities 
so attractive to walk along: the work is on show, the people are proud of what they're doing and happy to let the world notice and appreciate the practical side of things. There's a third principle of good cities: They are compact. In the past, being able to be alone or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement. Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together and it was horrid. As soon as people had money, 
they wanted to move out, and have their own plots. Through the later decades of 20th century, more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm. And it's been a disaster. It's become deadly, cold, and boring, and very, very wasteful on the environment. A compact city like Barcelona swallows a fraction of the energy of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona. We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs connected by sterile wide motorways all because we labor under the false impression that we want to be far away from other people. But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings. That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out. All the most beautiful compact cities have squares. Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline. We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones, but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades. It's not rocket science though. Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home. Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper, you get to be around other people, their moderating, cheering affect is restoring. It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home. There's an art to a good square: it should be neither too big nor too small, anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them, creating a sense of alienation and dislocation. In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square, You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side. The ideal square must offer a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia. There's another principle of good cities to do with orientation and mystery. By definition, cities are huge, but the cities that a lot of people love also have lots of little back streets and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost. We're drawn to the sense of mystery and enclosure that these streets offer. It's actually lovely to get a bit lost. A warren of alleyways can feel homely and intimate. At Cartagena, in Colombia, the balconies nearly touch across the street- you can see your neighbors having breakfast, you know when they've gone to bed, what time the children do their homework on a Sunday evening. The fact that everyone is little bit on display a lot of the time tends to make people nicer. They don't shout at each other quite so much. They put flowers on the table more often. We like it, but we forget that we do, and we don't quite know how to ask for it. Modern planners and developers give us maximum privacy because they suppose that's what we all want, and because they insist that cars and lorries, which like a lot more space than people, are the most important things in the world. Of course we need balance between small streets and big ones. Necessarily, cities are large. We love small streets, but they're a nightmare when you have to go any distance. So the ideal is to have big boulevards, grand, wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets. We need cities that offer us two important pleasures: the pleasures of mystery and the pleasures of orientation. Let's think about scale now. Modern cities are all about big things. Joseph Campbell once wrote: "If you want to see what a society really believes in, look at what the biggest buildings on the horizon are dedicated to". The biggest most prominent things tell us about the actual, rather than admitted priorities of a society. We don't collectively say we worship 
sports shoe corporations, tax specialists, the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals. Our cities, however, tell another story. They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things. That is a bit depressing. As humans, we don't mind things being big, per se, we don't mind being humbled, so long as the things we are bowing to deserve homage, like a beautiful mosque, or a cathedral, or a museum. But we've allowed our cities to be hijacked by aggressive commercial interests, by towers that honor not God, or love, or humanity, but pizza corporations and hedge funds. They exist because we've made a big dumb collective mistake: we focused on who owns land, but we don't think about who owns space, who has air rights. And in the end, who has air rights determines what you can see from your window. We suggest that the ideal height for any city block is five stories high. No more. Above that people start to feel small, insignificant, and trivial. So we say: cut down those towers and pack everything into five stories. Make it dense, compact, and tight, like they do in some parts of Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and Paris, the bits we love. Of course, occasionally there can be a huge building, but let's keep it for something really special, something all of humanity can love. Towers have to be worthy of their prominence, they must be aligned with our best ambitions and long-term needs. Finally, make it local. Somethings should be the same everywhere. We don't expect there to be a uniquely Venezuelan telephone or a distinctively Icelandic bicycle. But, we don't want buildings to look the same everywhere. It's hugely disappointing when you fly somewhere for hours, land, and feel you could be anywhere. The problem isn't just that we like a bit of variation for it's own sake; because of climate, history and social traditions, each society really does have different needs, different strengths and weaknesses. There are many distinct styles of happiness; many good and varied ways of conductive and collective life. The sameness of cities is a problem because it reveals how far each of us must be from engaging with an specific character of it's own place. It's like wearing the same clothes in all climates, or speaking exactly the same way irrespective of who you're talking to. Cities need to have strong characters connected to the use of distinctive local materials and forms. The pale sandstone, of Millbrae Crescent in Glasgow's south side, is a local material, A medium grained, carboniferous, blond sandstone- formed when the Scottish landmass lay near the equator. Or around Cambridge, brick from the local yellowish gault clay is a major traditional material. Or think of the way the great Australian architect, Glenn Murcutt, found ways to put up buildings that reflected the distinctive character Australian life. So the law should be: don't make your city from buildings that could be just anywhere; find a style of architecture that reflects what makes your location specific. The obstacles to building beautiful cities and not economic. Collectively, we've got enough money. We face two main problems: firstly, an intellectual confusion around beauty, and secondly, lack of political will. The intellectual confusion is: we think no one has a right to say what's beautiful and what's ugly; we get worried about who decides; we think beauty is subjective, so surely no one should say anything about it. It's a very understandable qualm, but it's horribly useful to greedy property developers. It's such a relief to these people to learn that there is no such thing as beauty; it means they can get away with murder. We may not agree to the very last point about what a beautiful city is, but we know an ugly one when we see it. No one's ever willingly taken holiday in Frankfurt-on-Main or Birmingham, and there are good reasons for this to do with an objective sense of beauty. So let's stop being dangerously relativistic about this. Yes! There is such a thing as beauty. Sydney and San Francisco and Bath and Bordeaux have it and most other places don't. The proof lies in the tourist statistics. Let's not just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; that's just a gift to the next wealthy idiot who wants to put up a horrible tower. The other obstacle is a lack of political will. We've abandoned the design of cities to the greedy rich. We've given up believing in democracy. We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism. There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development, but we can say no. Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations to keep the greedy, private guys in check. Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town, which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check. They were precise legislation detailing heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline. That's the only way you get beauty. They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos. When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building. We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new, which is wrong because we need places to live. Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905. When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up. The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature. We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions. Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing. Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for. That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action.

**Transcript**:
Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them; We should try hard to get them right. So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful. Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old, which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones. Why not, then, cities? It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance. We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly. It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others. This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities. There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right. 1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered One of the things we really love in cities is order. Order means balance, symmetry and repetition; it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side. Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris. But most cities are a complete mess. When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge. And that's worrying. It's horrible when everything is jumbled up. A pitched roof next to a flat roof, a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park, high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth. We generally have an itch to straighten things out, and when we can't, it's frustrating. The same urge is there when we look at cities. Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city, it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning, like they are increasingly in London, whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love. However, you have to keep something else in mind: excessive order can be just as much of a problem. Too much regularity can be soul destroying. Too much order feels rigid and alien. It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh. So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order. This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic: where every house is the same width and height but within that ordered pattern, every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict: each house has the same height and width, the color range is restricted, but within this grid, each unit is completely individual. We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here. And that's what humans adore. That's what more and more cities should have: order and variety. So as a general rule: too much mess, and it's off putting, but too much simple order, and it's boring. What we crave it's organized complexity which you can see as much here: as here: Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful: they have to have visible life. There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive and in general, we crave the live ones. This is a live street in Hong Kong. This is a live scene in Venice. In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved because they're full of life. There's always plenty going on. In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard. The work sheds are rough, but they're charming. It's fascinating to see what people are up to. How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas? The life of the city is on display, and we're primed to love this. Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities. Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done look dull and dead. They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life. More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away. We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers, connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans. Rather than the old alleyways 
where you can see people at work, look them in the eye as they walk down the road and feel connected to others. Modern planners have become obessed by hiding technology rather than trying to make it nice to look at. Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline was gonna be slapped across a lovely river; we'd be up in arms! But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France. That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness. So let's make sure our streets are full of life, full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows. That's what make certain cities 
so attractive to walk along: the work is on show, the people are proud of what they're doing and happy to let the world notice and appreciate the practical side of things. There's a third principle of good cities: They are compact. In the past, being able to be alone or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement. Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together and it was horrid. As soon as people had money, 
they wanted to move out, and have their own plots. Through the later decades of 20th century, more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm. And it's been a disaster. It's become deadly, cold, and boring, and very, very wasteful on the environment. A compact city like Barcelona swallows a fraction of the energy of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona. We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs connected by sterile wide motorways all because we labor under the false impression that we want to be far away from other people. But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings. That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out. All the most beautiful compact cities have squares. Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline. We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones, but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades. It's not rocket science though. Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home. Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper, you get to be around other people, their moderating, cheering affect is restoring. It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home. There's an art to a good square: it should be neither too big nor too small, anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them, creating a sense of alienation and dislocation. In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square, You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side.

sports shoe corporations, tax specialists, the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals. Our cities, however, tell another story. They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things.

They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life. More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away. We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers, connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans. Rather than the old alleyways 
where you can see people at work, look them in the eye as they walk down the road and feel connected to others. Modern planners have become obessed by hiding technology rather than trying to make it nice to look at. Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline was gonna be slapped across a lovely river; we'd be up in arms! But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France. That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness. So let's make sure our streets are full of life, full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows. That's what make certain cities 
so attractive to walk along: the work is on show, the people are proud of what they're doing and happy to let the world notice and appreciate the practical side of things. There's a third principle of good cities: They are compact. In the past, being able to be alone or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement. Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together and it was horrid. As soon as people had money, 
they wanted to move out, and have their own plots. Through the later decades of 20th century, more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm. And it's been a disaster. It's become deadly, cold, and boring, and very, very wasteful on the environment. A compact city like Barcelona swallows a fraction of the energy of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona. We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs connected by sterile wide motorways all because we labor under the false impression that we want to be far away from other people. But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings. That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out. All the most beautiful compact cities have squares. Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline. We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones, but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades. It's not rocket science though. Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home. Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper, you get to be around other people, their moderating, cheering affect is restoring. It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home. There's an art to a good square: it should be neither too big nor too small, anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them, creating a sense of alienation and dislocation. In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square, You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side. The ideal square must offer a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia. There's another principle of good cities to do with orientation and mystery. By definition, cities are huge, but the cities that a lot of people love also have lots of little back streets and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost. We're drawn to the sense of mystery and enclosure that these streets offer. It's actually lovely to get a bit lost. A warren of alleyways can feel homely and intimate. At Cartagena, in Colombia, the balconies nearly touch across the street- you can see your neighbors having breakfast, you know when they've gone to bed, what time the children do their homework on a Sunday evening. The fact that everyone is little bit on display a lot of the time tends to make people nicer. They don't shout at each other quite so much. They put flowers on the table more often. We like it, but we forget that we do, and we don't quite know how to ask for it. Modern planners and developers give us maximum privacy because they suppose that's what we all want, and because they insist that cars and lorries, which like a lot more space than people, are the most important things in the world. Of course we need balance between small streets and big ones. Necessarily, cities are large. We love small streets, but they're a nightmare when you have to go any distance. So the ideal is to have big boulevards, grand, wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets. We need cities that offer us two important pleasures: the pleasures of mystery and the pleasures of orientation. Let's think about scale now. Modern cities are all about big things. Joseph Campbell once wrote: "If you want to see what a society really believes in, look at what the biggest buildings on the horizon are dedicated to". The biggest most prominent things tell us about the actual, rather than admitted priorities of a society. We don't collectively say we worship 
sports shoe corporations, tax specialists, the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals. Our cities, however, tell another story. They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things. That is a bit depressing. As humans, we don't mind things being big, per se, we don't mind being humbled, so long as the things we are bowing to deserve homage, like a beautiful mosque, or a cathedral, or a museum. But we've allowed our cities to be hijacked by aggressive commercial interests, by towers that honor not God, or love, or humanity, but pizza corporations and hedge funds. They exist because we've made a big dumb collective mistake: we focused on who owns land, but we don't think about who owns space, who has air rights. And in the end, who has air rights determines what you can see from your window. We suggest that the ideal height for any city block is five stories high. No more. Above that people start to feel small, insignificant, and trivial. So we say: cut down those towers and pack everything into five stories. Make it dense, compact, and tight, like they do in some parts of Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and Paris, the bits we love. Of course, occasionally there can be a huge building, but let's keep it for something really special, something all of humanity can love. Towers have to be worthy of their prominence, they must be aligned with our best ambitions and long-term needs. Finally, make it local. Somethings should be the same everywhere. We don't expect there to be a uniquely Venezuelan telephone or a distinctively Icelandic bicycle. But, we don't want buildings to look the same everywhere. It's hugely disappointing when you fly somewhere for hours, land, and feel you could be anywhere. The problem isn't just that we like a bit of variation for it's own sake; because of climate, history and social traditions, each society really does have different needs, different strengths and weaknesses. There are many distinct styles of happiness; many good and varied ways of conductive and collective life. The sameness of cities is a problem because it reveals how far each of us must be from engaging with an specific character of it's own place. It's like wearing the same clothes in all climates, or speaking exactly the same way irrespective of who you're talking to. Cities need to have strong characters connected to the use of distinctive local materials and forms. The pale sandstone, of Millbrae Crescent in Glasgow's south side, is a local material, A medium grained, carboniferous, blond sandstone- formed when the Scottish landmass lay near the equator. Or around Cambridge, brick from the local yellowish gault clay is a major traditional material. Or think of the way the great Australian architect, Glenn Murcutt, found ways to put up buildings that reflected the distinctive character Australian life. So the law should be: don't make your city from buildings that could be just anywhere; find a style of architecture that reflects what makes your location specific. The obstacles to building beautiful cities and not economic. Collectively, we've got enough money. We face two main problems: firstly, an intellectual confusion around beauty, and secondly, lack of political will. The intellectual confusion is: we think no one has a right to say what's beautiful and what's ugly; we get worried about who decides; we think beauty is subjective, so surely no one should say anything about it. It's a very understandable qualm, but it's horribly useful to greedy property developers. It's such a relief to these people to learn that there is no such thing as beauty; it means they can get away with murder. We may not agree to the very last point about what a beautiful city is, but we know an ugly one when we see it. No one's ever willingly taken holiday in Frankfurt-on-Main or Birmingham, and there are good reasons for this to do with an objective sense of beauty. So let's stop being dangerously relativistic about this. Yes! There is such a thing as beauty. Sydney and San Francisco and Bath and Bordeaux have it and most other places don't. The proof lies in the tourist statistics. Let's not just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; that's just a gift to the next wealthy idiot who wants to put up a horrible tower. The other obstacle is a lack of political will. We've abandoned the design of cities to the greedy rich. We've given up believing in democracy. We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism. There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development, but we can say no. Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations to keep the greedy, private guys in check. Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town, which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check. They were precise legislation detailing heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline. That's the only way you get beauty. They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos. When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building. We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new, which is wrong because we need places to live. Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905. When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up. The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature. We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions. Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing. Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for. That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action.

**Transcript**:
Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them; We should try hard to get them right. So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful. Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old, which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones. Why not, then, cities? It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance. We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly. It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others. This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities. There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right. 1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered One of the things we really love in cities is order. Order means balance, symmetry and repetition; it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side. Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris. But most cities are a complete mess. When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge. And that's worrying. It's horrible when everything is jumbled up. A pitched roof next to a flat roof, a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park, high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth. We generally have an itch to straighten things out, and when we can't, it's frustrating. The same urge is there when we look at cities. Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city, it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning, like they are increasingly in London, whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love. However, you have to keep something else in mind: excessive order can be just as much of a problem. Too much regularity can be soul destroying. Too much order feels rigid and alien. It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh. So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order. This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic: where every house is the same width and height but within that ordered pattern, every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict: each house has the same height and width, the color range is restricted, but within this grid, each unit is completely individual. We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here. And that's what humans adore. That's what more and more cities should have: order and variety. So as a general rule: too much mess, and it's off putting, but too much simple order, and it's boring. What we crave it's organized complexity which you can see as much here: as here: Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful: they have to have visible life. There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive and in general, we crave the live ones. This is a live street in Hong Kong. This is a live scene in Venice. In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved because they're full of life. There's always plenty going on. In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard. The work sheds are rough, but they're charming. It's fascinating to see what people are up to. How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas? The life of the city is on display, and we're primed to love this. Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities. Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done look dull and dead. They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working 
in all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life.

That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness.

a star exploded. There goes another one. In fact, a supernova occurs every second
or so in the observable universe, and there is one on average
every 25 to 50 years in a galaxy the size 
and age of the Milky Way. Yet we've never actually been able
to watch one happen from its first violent moments. Of course, how would we? There are hundreds of billions
of stars close enough that we could watch 
the supernova explosion break through the surface of the star. But we'd have to have our best telescopes
focused on the right one at precisely the right time
to get meaningful data. Suffice it to say, the odds of that
happening are astronomically low. But what if we could anticipate 
a supernova before its light reached us? That may seem impossible. After all, nothing travels faster
than the speed of light, right? As far as we know, yes. But in a race, fast doesn't matter
if you take a detour while someone else beelines it
for the finish line. For exactly that reason, photons don't win 
the supernova race to Earth. Neutrinos do. Here's why. There are two types of supernova. Type 1 is when a star accumulates
so much matter from a neighboring star, that a runaway nuclear reaction ignites
and causes it to explode. In type 2, the star runs out 
of nuclear fuel, so the gravitational forces pulling in overwhelm the quantum mechanical 
forces pushing out, and the stellar core collapses under
its own weight in a hundredth of a second. While the outer reaches of the star
are unaffected by the collapsed core, the inner edges accelerate 
through the void, smash into the core,
and rebound to launch the explosion. In both of these scenarios, the star expels an unparalleled
amount of energy, as well as a great deal of matter. In fact, all atoms heavier than nickel,
including elements like gold and silver, only form in supernova reactions. In type 2 supernovae, about 1% of the energy 
consists of photons, which we know of as light, while 99% radiates out as neutrinos, the elementary particles that are known
for rarely interacting with anything. Starting from the center of the star, the exploding matter takes 
tens of minutes, or even hours, or in rare cases, several days, to reach
and break through the surface of the star. However, the neutrinos, 
thanks to their non-interactivity, take a much more direct route. By the time there is any visible change
in the star's suface, the neutrinos typically have a several
hour head start over the photons. That's why astronomers and physicists have been able to set up a project
called SNEWS, the Supernova Early Warning System. When detectors around the world
pick up bursts of neutrinos, they send messages 
to a central computer in New York. If multiple detectors receive 
similar signals within ten seconds, SNEWS will trigger an alert warning
that a supernova is imminent. Aided by some distance and direction
information from the neutrino detectors, the amateur astronomers 
and scientists alike will scan the skies and share information to quickly identify 
the new galactic supernova and turn the world's major 
telescopes in that direction. The last supernova that sent detectable
neutrinos to Earth was in 1987 on the edge of the Tarantula Nebula in the large Magellanic Cloud,
a nearby galaxy. Its neutrinos reached Earth about
three hours ahead of the visible light. We're due for another one any day now,
and when that happens, SNEWS should give you the opportunity
to be among the first to witness something that no human has ever seen before.

**Transcript**:
If you ask people whether 
they think stealing is wrong, most of them would answer, "Yes." And yet, in 2013, organizations
all over the world lost an estimated total
of 3.7 trillion dollars to fraud, which includes crimes like embezzlement, pyramid schemes, and false insurance claims. This wasn't just the work
of a few bad apples. The truth is that many people
are susceptible not only to the temptation 
to commit fraud but to convincing themselves
that they've done nothing wrong. So why does fraud happen? While individual motivations 
may differ from case to case, the fraud triangle, a model developed
by criminologist Donald Cressey, shows three conditions 
that make fraud likely: pressure, opportunity,
and rationalization. Pressure is often what motivates someone
to engage in fraud to begin with. It could be a personal debt, an addiction, an earnings quota, a sudden job loss, or an illness in the family. As for opportunity, many people
in both public and private sectors have access to tools that enable them
to commit and conceal fraud: corporate credit cards, internal company data, or control over the budget. The combination of pressure and being exposed to such opportunities
on a daily basis can create a strong temptation. But even with these two elements, most fraud still requires rationalization. Many fraudsters are first time offenders, so in order to commit an act
most would regard as wrong, they need to justify it to themselves. Some feel entitled to the money
because they are underpaid and overworked and others believe 
their fraud is victimless, perhaps even planning to return
the money once their crisis is resolved. Some of the most common types of fraud don't even register as such
to the perpetrator. Examples include employees
fudging time sheets or expense reports, taxpayers failing to report cash earnings, or service providers overbilling
insurance companies. Though these may seem small, and can sometimes
only involve hundreds of dollars, they all contribute to the big picture. And then there's fraud on a massive scale. In 2003, Italian dairy food giant 
Parmalat went bankrupt after it was found to have fabricated
a 4 billion dollar bank account and falsified financial statements to hide the fact that its subsidiaries
had been losing money. Because it was family controlled, corporate governance 
and regulator supervision were difficult, and the company likely hoped 
that the losses could be recouped before anyone found out. And it's not just corporate greed. Governments and non-profits
are also susceptible to fraud. During her time as City Comptroller
for Dixon, Illinois, Rita Crundwell embezzled 
over 53 million dollars. Rita was one of the country's leading 
quarter horse breeders and winner of 52 world championships. But the cost of maintaining the herd
ran to 200,000 dollars per month. Because her position gave her complete
control over city finances, she was easily able to divert money to an account she used 
for private expenses, and the scheme went 
unnoticed for 20 years. It is believed that Crundwell
felt entitled to a lavish lifestyle based on her position, and the notoriety 
her winnings brought to the city. It's tempting to think of fraud
as a victimless crime because corporations 
and civic institutions aren't people. But fraud harms real people
in virtually every case: the employees of Parmalat 
who lost their jobs, the citizens of Dixon whose taxes
subsidized horse breeding, the customers of companies
which raise their prices to offset losses. Sometimes the effects are obvious
and devestating, like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands
of people to lose their life savings. But often they're subtle
and not easy to untangle. Yet someone, 
somewhere is left holding the bill.

only involve hundreds of dollars, they all contribute to the big picture. And then there's fraud on a massive scale. In 2003, Italian dairy food giant 
Parmalat went bankrupt after it was found to have fabricated
a 4 billion dollar bank account and falsified financial statements to hide the fact that its subsidiaries
had been losing money. Because it was family controlled, corporate governance 
and regulator supervision were difficult, and the company likely hoped 
that the losses could be recouped before anyone found out. And it's not just corporate greed. Governments and non-profits
are also susceptible to fraud. During her time as City Comptroller
for Dixon, Illinois, Rita Crundwell embezzled 
over 53 million dollars. Rita was one of the country's leading 
quarter horse breeders and winner of 52 world championships. But the cost of maintaining the herd
ran to 200,000 dollars per month. Because her position gave her complete
control over city finances, she was easily able to divert money to an account she used 
for private expenses, and the scheme went 
unnoticed for 20 years. It is believed that Crundwell
felt entitled to a lavish lifestyle based on her position, and the notoriety 
her winnings brought to the city. It's tempting to think of fraud
as a victimless crime because corporations 
and civic institutions aren't people. But fraud harms real people
in virtually every case: the employees of Parmalat 
who lost their jobs, the citizens of Dixon whose taxes
subsidized horse breeding, the customers of companies
which raise their prices to offset losses. Sometimes the effects are obvious
and devestating, like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands
of people to lose their life savings. But often they're subtle
and not easy to untangle. Yet someone, 
somewhere is left holding the bill.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Michael Jordan once said, "I don't know whether I'll fly or not. I know that when I'm in the air sometimes I feel like I don't ever
have to come down." But thanks to Isaac Newton, we know that what goes up
must eventually come down. In fact, the human limit 
on a flat surface for hang time, or the time from when your feet leave
the ground to when they touch down again, is only about one second, and, yes, that even includes his airness, whose infamous dunk 
from the free throw line has been calculated at .92 seconds. And, of course, gravity is what's making it
so hard to stay in the air longer. Earth's gravity pulls all nearby objects
towards the planet's surface, accelerating them 
at 9.8 meters per second squared. As soon as you jump,
gravity is already pulling you back down. Using what we know about gravity, we can derive a fairly simple equation
that models hang time. This equation states that the height
of a falling object above a surface is equal to the object's initial height
from the surface plus its initial velocity multiplied by how many seconds
it's been in the air, plus half of the 
gravitational acceleration multiplied by the square of the number
of seconds spent in the air. Now we can use this equation to model
MJ's free throw dunk. Say MJ starts, as one does,
at zero meters off the ground, and jumps with an initial vertical
velocity of 4.51 meters per second. Let's see what happens if we model
this equation on a coordinate grid. Since the formula is quadratic, the relationship between height
and time spent in the air has the shape of a parabola. So what does it tell us about MJ's dunk? Well, the parabola's vertex shows us
his maximum height off the ground at 1.038 meters, and the X-intercepts tell us 
when he took off and when he landed,
with the difference being the hang time. It looks like Earth's gravity
makes it pretty hard for even MJ to get some solid hang time. But what if he were playing an away game
somewhere else, somewhere far? Well, the gravitational acceleration
on our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, is 8.87 meters per second squared, 
pretty similar to Earth's. If Michael jumped here with the same
force as he did back on Earth, he would be able to get more 
than a meter off the ground, giving him a hang time 
of a little over one second. The competition on Jupiter
with its gravitational pull of 24.92 meters per second squared
would be much less entertaining. Here, Michael wouldn't even
get a half meter off the ground, and would remain airborne
a mere .41 seconds. But a game on the moon
would be quite spectacular. MJ could take off from behind half court, jumping over six meters high, and his hang time of over 
five and half seconds, would be long enough for anyone
to believe he could fly.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

at 9.8 meters per second squared. As soon as you jump,
gravity is already pulling you back down. Using what we know about gravity, we can derive a fairly simple equation
that models hang time. This equation states that the height
of a falling object above a surface is equal to the object's initial height
from the surface plus its initial velocity multiplied by how many seconds
it's been in the air, plus half of the 
gravitational acceleration multiplied by the square of the number
of seconds spent in the air. Now we can use this equation to model
MJ's free throw dunk. Say MJ starts, as one does,
at zero meters off the ground, and jumps with an initial vertical
velocity of 4.51 meters per second. Let's see what happens if we model
this equation on a coordinate grid. Since the formula is quadratic, the relationship between height
and time spent in the air has the shape of a parabola. So what does it tell us about MJ's dunk? Well, the parabola's vertex shows us
his maximum height off the ground at 1.038 meters, and the X-intercepts tell us 
when he took off and when he landed,
with the difference being the hang time. It looks like Earth's gravity
makes it pretty hard for even MJ to get some solid hang time. But what if he were playing an away game
somewhere else, somewhere far? Well, the gravitational acceleration
on our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, is 8.87 meters per second squared, 
pretty similar to Earth's. If Michael jumped here with the same
force as he did back on Earth, he would be able to get more 
than a meter off the ground, giving him a hang time 
of a little over one second. The competition on Jupiter
with its gravitational pull of 24.92 meters per second squared
would be much less entertaining. Here, Michael wouldn't even
get a half meter off the ground, and would remain airborne
a mere .41 seconds. But a game on the moon
would be quite spectacular. MJ could take off from behind half court, jumping over six meters high, and his hang time of over 
five and half seconds, would be long enough for anyone
to believe he could fly.

**Transcript**:
Maybe you've recently seen the phrase
"gluten-free" on food packaging, or take-out menus, shampoo bottles,
apartment listings, the tag of your shirt, on a hammer, as a lower back tattoo,
or in your friend's resume. Next time someone starts telling you
about their newfound freedom from gluten, here are some questions you can ask, and the well-informed answers
that your friend, being a reasonable individual
making educated dietary choices, and by no means just following 
the latest diet craze, will tell you. What is gluten? Gluten is an insoluble protein composite made up of two proteins 
named gliadin and glutenin. Where might you encounter gluten? Gluten is found in certain grains,
particularly wheat, rye and barley. What has gluten been doing for
the previous entirety of human history, and why do you suddenly care about it? Gluten is responsible 
for the elastic consistency of dough and the chewiness of foods 
made from wheat flour, like bread and pasta. For some people, 
these foods cause problems, namely wheat allergy, celiac disease,
and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition that occurs when a person's immune system mounts an allergic response 
to wheat proteins, leading to mild problems,
and in rare cases, a potential dangerous reaction
called anaphylaxis. Celiac disease is an inherited disease, in which eating foods with gluten leads to inflammation and damage
of the lining of the small intestine. This impairs intestinal function, leading to problems like belly pain,
bloating, gas, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rash, bone problems
like osteoporosis, iron deficiency, small stature, 
infertility, fatigue and depression. Untreated, celiac disease 
increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Celiac disease is present in one 
in every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S. When blood tests suggest 
the possibility of celiac, the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy. The most effective treatment
is a gluten-free diet, which helps heal intestinal damage
and improve symptoms. Some people don't have celiac disease
or a wheat allergy, but still experience symptoms
when they eat foods with gluten. These people have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity. They experience painful gut symptoms and suffer from fatigue, brain fog,
joint pain or skin rash. A gluten-free diet typically helps
with these symptoms. So how many people actually
have this gluten sensitivity you speak of? Gluten sensitivity's occurrence 
in the general population is unclear, but likely much more common
than wheat allergy or celiac disease. Diagnosis is based 
on the development of symptoms, the absence of wheat allergy
and celiac disease, and subsequent improvement
on a gluten-free diet. There's no reliable blood or tissue test, partly because gluten sensitivity
isn't a single disease, and has a number 
of different possible causes. For example, it may be the case that gluten can activate the immune system
in the small intestine, or cause it to become leaky. But sometimes, people claiming
gluten sensitivity are actually sensitive 
not to wheat proteins, but sugars found in wheat and other foods,
called fructans. The human intestine can't break down
or absorb fructans, so they make their way 
to the large intestine or colon, where they're fermented by bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids
and gases. This leads to unpleasant symptoms
in some people with bowel problems. Another possible explanation behind
gluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect. This occurs when a person believes
something will cause problems, and because of that belief, it does. It's the opposite of the more well-known
and much more fortuitous placebo effect. Given how much bad press 
gluten is getting in the media, the nocebo response may play a role for some people who think
they're sensitive to gluten. For all these reasons, it's clear that 
the problems people develop when they eat wheat and other grains
aren't exclusively due to gluten. So a better name than
non-celiac gluten sensitivty might be wheat intolerance.

**Transcript**:
Maybe you've recently seen the phrase
"gluten-free" on food packaging, or take-out menus, shampoo bottles,
apartment listings, the tag of your shirt, on a hammer, as a lower back tattoo,
or in your friend's resume. Next time someone starts telling you
about their newfound freedom from gluten, here are some questions you can ask, and the well-informed answers
that your friend, being a reasonable individual
making educated dietary choices, and by no means just following 
the latest diet craze, will tell you. What is gluten? Gluten is an insoluble protein composite made up of two proteins 
named gliadin and glutenin. Where might you encounter gluten? Gluten is found in certain grains,
particularly wheat, rye and barley. What has gluten been doing for
the previous entirety of human history, and why do you suddenly care about it? Gluten is responsible 
for the elastic consistency of dough and the chewiness of foods 
made from wheat flour, like bread and pasta. For some people, 
these foods cause problems, namely wheat allergy, celiac disease,
and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition that occurs when a person's immune system mounts an allergic response 
to wheat proteins, leading to mild problems,
and in rare cases, a potential dangerous reaction
called anaphylaxis. Celiac disease is an inherited disease, in which eating foods with gluten leads to inflammation and damage
of the lining of the small intestine. This impairs intestinal function, leading to problems like belly pain,
bloating, gas, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rash, bone problems
like osteoporosis, iron deficiency, small stature, 
infertility, fatigue and depression. Untreated, celiac disease 
increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Celiac disease is present in one 
in every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S. When blood tests suggest 
the possibility of celiac, the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy. The most effective treatment
is a gluten-free diet, which helps heal intestinal damage
and improve symptoms. Some people don't have celiac disease
or a wheat allergy, but still experience symptoms
when they eat foods with gluten. These people have non-celiac
gluten sensitivity. They experience painful gut symptoms and suffer from fatigue, brain fog,
joint pain or skin rash. A gluten-free diet typically helps
with these symptoms. So how many people actually
have this gluten sensitivity you speak of? Gluten sensitivity's occurrence 
in the general population is unclear, but likely much more common
than wheat allergy or celiac disease. Diagnosis is based 
on the development of symptoms, the absence of wheat allergy
and celiac disease, and subsequent improvement
on a gluten-free diet. There's no reliable blood or tissue test, partly because gluten sensitivity
isn't a single disease, and has a number 
of different possible causes. For example, it may be the case that gluten can activate the immune system
in the small intestine, or cause it to become leaky. But sometimes, people claiming
gluten sensitivity are actually sensitive 
not to wheat proteins, but sugars found in wheat and other foods,
called fructans. The human intestine can't break down
or absorb fructans, so they make their way 
to the large intestine or colon, where they're fermented by bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids
and gases. This leads to unpleasant symptoms
in some people with bowel problems. Another possible explanation behind
gluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect. This occurs when a person believes
something will cause problems, and because of that belief, it does. It's the opposite of the more well-known
and much more fortuitous placebo effect. Given how much bad press 
gluten is getting in the media, the nocebo response may play a role for some people who think
they're sensitive to gluten. For all these reasons, it's clear that 
the problems people develop when they eat wheat and other grains
aren't exclusively due to gluten. So a better name than
non-celiac gluten sensitivty might be wheat intolerance.

[MUSIC PLAYING] Getting sick
stinks-- literally. What I mean is that
different diseases give off different odors, and sometimes
doctors can diagnose you based on how you smell. I'm Anna Rothschild, and
this is "Gross Science." So it turns out
that doctors have known since the
time of Hippocrates that different diseases
smell different ways. For example,
typhoid-- which causes fever, abdominal pain,
delirium, and can kill you-- smells like freshly
baked brown bread. Other infections smell
totally differently. The skin of people with
the virus yellow fever is said to smell
like a butcher shop. And if you have a burn wound
infected with the bacteria Pseudomonas, it might
smell like grape juice. But infections from
bacteria and viruses aren't the only
diseases that can make you emit a certain aroma. Genetic conditions--
ones you're born with-- can do the same thing. For example, maple
syrup urine disease, which can be fatal
if untreated, makes you smell like maple syrup. And then there's a condition
called Trimethylaminuria, which has absolutely no
symptoms, except that it makes you smell like rotten fish. And those are just diseases
that humans can smell. Dogs can actually sniff out
certain types of cancer, and scientists have now
created electronic noses. These are smelling
machines that can detect very faint
traces of compounds that the human nose would
never be able to pick up. Beep boop beep. In fact, researchers are looking
into using dogs or e-noses to detect diseases before
they become dangerous. So while sniffing out
the source of an illness has never really
gone away, there's a whole new frontier of
stench science out there. Just take a whiff. Ew. What's the grossest thing
you've ever smelled? Let me know in the comments. And for more "Gross Science"

**Transcript**:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let us welcome you to the final day of
dramatic battle between great tragedians. It is a spring day here in Ancient Greece. Nearly 17,000 patrons are filing
into the Theatre of Dionysus to watch top playwrights, including favorites Aeschylus
and Sophocles duke it out to see whose hero 
may be deemed most tragic, whose story most awful. Well Seacrestopolis, in last week's battle of the choruses, all 50 members of each playwright's chorus
traveled back and forth across the stage, singing the strophe and antistrophe,
telling misbegotten tales of woe. Today's first chorus is entering 
through the parados, taking their positions in the orchestra
at the bottom of the stage. Mario Lopedokia, this is nothing
we haven't seen before. All 50 members speaking
from the depths of their souls. Wait, what is this? I've not seen this before, Seacrestopolis. There is one actor stepping out
of choral formation, assuming an independent role in this play. Can you make out who it is? That looks like Thespis. It seems he's changing his mask, and taking on the role 
of another character. Incredible. Surely, Thespis will go down
in history as the very first actor. He has changed 
the face of theater forever. And that was just the warm-up act. On to the main attraction. Aeschylus will have the stage first. Let's see what he does. We expect great things. Last competition, 
Sophocles beat him by a smidge, but Aeschylus is still considered
the Father of Tragedy. Now, Aeschylus frequently competes
at this festival, the city Dionysia. Though his plays are violent, the bloodshed is never 
seen by the audience, which allows the dramatic tension
to take center stage. Let's see what he does today
to try to win his title back. Here comes Aeschylus's chorus, but they seem to be missing 
quite a few people. What is going on here? Not only are they down a few people. There are two actors taking center stage. This is absolutely unheard of. He has build on Thespis's idea
and added a second actor to the mix. Aeschylus is relying on 
the two individuals to tell the story. The dialogue possible in tragedy
now has taken precedence over the chorus. No wonder he drastically shrunk its size. This applause is well deserved. The crowd has hushed. Sophocles's actors and chorus are taking the stage for the play,
"Oedipus Rex." As usual, the chorus 
is set up in the orchestra. And what's this? Sophocles has added a third actor. Will this one-upmanship never end? Three actors, and they are changing their masks
to take on several different roles as they weave the tale of Oedipus, a nice fellow who kills his father
and marries his mother. Kills his father and marries his mother. That sounds pretty tragic to me. It is most tragic, Mario Lopedokia. Call me crazy, but I'm willing to bet
that future generations will hold this play up 
as the perfect example of tragedy. Excuse me, Seacrestopolis. Oedipus has left the stage after realizing
Jocasta was his wife and also his mother. Where has he gone? I can't even imagine. Wait. The messenger has stepped on stage and is telling us 
of the great king's actions. He says that Oedipus, upon finding
his mother, wife, whatever, Jocasta, dead of her own hand 
in their incestuous bedroom, took the broaches from her dress
and stabbed his eyes repeatedly. You can't blame the guy, can you? Bedded his mother, killed his father,
is father and brother to his children. I might do the same. My friend, I do believe we've seen it all. Indeed, we have. There is nothing more tragic than Oedipus. And sure enough, the judges who have
been chosen by lot from all over Greece are ready to announce the winner. Oh, folks! This is one 
for the history books. Dark horse playwright, Philocles,
has taken first prize. What an upset. What a tragedy. What a night, folks. We have witnessed the laying
of the foundation of modern theater and some great innovations: the shrinking of the chorus, the addition of three actors, and such catharsis. Doesn't a great tragedy just make you feel
renewed and cleansed? It sure does, but now we are out of time. I'm Seacrestopolis, and I'm Mario Lopedokia. Peace, love and catharsis.

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Let us welcome you to the final day of
dramatic battle between great tragedians. It is a spring day here in Ancient Greece. Nearly 17,000 patrons are filing
into the Theatre of Dionysus to watch top playwrights, including favorites Aeschylus
and Sophocles duke it out to see whose hero 
may be deemed most tragic, whose story most awful. Well Seacrestopolis, in last week's battle of the choruses, all 50 members of each playwright's chorus
traveled back and forth across the stage, singing the strophe and antistrophe,
telling misbegotten tales of woe. Today's first chorus is entering 
through the parados, taking their positions in the orchestra
at the bottom of the stage. Mario Lopedokia, this is nothing
we haven't seen before. All 50 members speaking
from the depths of their souls. Wait, what is this? I've not seen this before, Seacrestopolis. There is one actor stepping out
of choral formation, assuming an independent role in this play. Can you make out who it is? That looks like Thespis. It seems he's changing his mask, and taking on the role 
of another character. Incredible. Surely, Thespis will go down
in history as the very first actor. He has changed 
the face of theater forever. And that was just the warm-up act. On to the main attraction. Aeschylus will have the stage first. Let's see what he does. We expect great things. Last competition, 
Sophocles beat him by a smidge, but Aeschylus is still considered
the Father of Tragedy. Now, Aeschylus frequently competes
at this festival, the city Dionysia. Though his plays are violent, the bloodshed is never 
seen by the audience, which allows the dramatic tension
to take center stage. Let's see what he does today
to try to win his title back. Here comes Aeschylus's chorus, but they seem to be missing 
quite a few people. What is going on here? Not only are they down a few people. There are two actors taking center stage. This is absolutely unheard of. He has build on Thespis's idea
and added a second actor to the mix. Aeschylus is relying on

is father and brother to his children. I might do the same. My friend, I do believe we've seen it all. Indeed, we have. There is nothing more tragic than Oedipus. And sure enough, the judges who have
been chosen by lot from all over Greece are ready to announce the winner. Oh, folks! This is one 
for the history books. Dark horse playwright, Philocles,
has taken first prize. What an upset. What a tragedy. What a night, folks. We have witnessed the laying
of the foundation of modern theater and some great innovations: the shrinking of the chorus, the addition of three actors, and such catharsis. Doesn't a great tragedy just make you feel
renewed and cleansed? It sure does, but now we are out of time. I'm Seacrestopolis, and I'm Mario Lopedokia. Peace, love and catharsis.

**Transcript**:
When you picture a spaceship,
you probably think of something like this, or this, or maybe this. What do they all have in common? Among other things, they're huge
because they have to carry people, fuel, and all sorts of supplies, 
scientific instruments, and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers. But the next real-world generation 
of spacecraft may be much, much smaller. We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny. Imagine sending a swarm of these
microspacecraft out into the galaxy. They could explore 
distant stars and planets by carrying sophisticated 
electronic sensors that would measure everything
from temperature to cosmic rays. You could deploy thousands of them for the cost of a single 
space shuttle mission, exponentially increasing 
the amount of data we could collect about the universe. And they're individually expendable, meaning that we could send them 
into environments that are too risky 
for a billion dollar rocket or probe. Several hundred small spacecraft
are already orbiting the Earth, taking pictures of outer space, and collecting data on things, like the behavior of bacteria 
in the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic signals that could help
predict earthquakes. But imagine how much more we could learn
if they could fly beyond Earth's orbit. That's exactly what organizations,
like NASA, want to do: send microspacecraft 
to scout habitable planets and describe astronomical phenomena
we can't study from Earth. But something so small can't carry 
a large engine or tons of fuel, so how would such a vessel propel itself? For microspacecraft, it turns out, 
you need micropropulsion. On really small scales, some of the familiar 
rules of physics don't apply, in particular, everyday 
Newtonian mechanics break down, and forces that are normally negligible
become powerful. Those forces include surface tension
and capillary action, the phenomena 
that govern other small things. Micropropulsion systems can harness
these forces to power spacecraft. One example of how this might work is called microfluidic 
electrospray propulsion. It's a type of ion thruster, which means that it shoots out
charged particles to generate momentum. One model being developed at NASA's
jet propulsion laboratory is only a couple centimeters 
on each side. Here's how it works. That postage-stamp sized metal plate
is studded with a hundred skinny needles and coated with a metal 
that has a low melting point, like indium. A metal grid sits above the needles, and an electric field is set up
between the grid and the plate. When the plate is heated,
the indium melts and capillary action draws 
the liquid metal up the needles. The electric field tugs 
the molten metal upwards, while surface tension pulls it back, causing the indium to deform into a cone. The small radius of the tips 
of the needles makes it possible for the electric field
to overcome the surface tension, and when that happens, positively charged ions shoot off at
speeds of tens of kilometers per second. That stream of ions propels the spacecraft
in the opposite direction, thanks to Newton's third law. And while each ion 
is an extremely small particle, the combined force of so many of them
pushing away from the craft is enough to generate 
significant acceleration. And unlike the exhaust 
that pours out of a rocket engine, this stream is much smaller
and far more fuel efficient, which makes it better suited
for long deep-space missions. These micropropulsion systems
haven't been fully tested yet, but some scientists think that they
will provide enough thrust to break small craft out of Earth's orbit. In fact, they're predicting that thousands
of microspacecraft will be launched in the next ten years to gather data that today 
we can only dream about. And that is micro-rocket science.

you probably think of something like this, or this, or maybe this. What do they all have in common? Among other things, they're huge
because they have to carry people, fuel, and all sorts of supplies, 
scientific instruments, and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers. But the next real-world generation 
of spacecraft may be much, much smaller. We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny. Imagine sending a swarm of these
microspacecraft out into the galaxy. They could explore 
distant stars and planets by carrying sophisticated 
electronic sensors that would measure everything
from temperature to cosmic rays. You could deploy thousands of them for the cost of a single 
space shuttle mission, exponentially increasing 
the amount of data we could collect about the universe. And they're individually expendable, meaning that we could send them 
into environments that are too risky 
for a billion dollar rocket or probe. Several hundred small spacecraft
are already orbiting the Earth, taking pictures of outer space, and collecting data on things, like the behavior of bacteria 
in the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic signals that could help
predict earthquakes. But imagine how much more we could learn
if they could fly beyond Earth's orbit. That's exactly what organizations,
like NASA, want to do: send microspacecraft 
to scout habitable planets and describe astronomical phenomena
we can't study from Earth. But something so small can't carry 
a large engine or tons of fuel, so how would such a vessel propel itself? For microspacecraft, it turns out, 
you need micropropulsion. On really small scales, some of the familiar 
rules of physics don't apply, in particular, everyday 
Newtonian mechanics break down, and forces that are normally negligible
become powerful. Those forces include surface tension
and capillary action, the phenomena 
that govern other small things. Micropropulsion systems can harness
these forces to power spacecraft. One example of how this might work is called microfluidic 
electrospray propulsion. It's a type of ion thruster, which means that it shoots out
charged particles to generate momentum. One model being developed at NASA's
jet propulsion laboratory is only a couple centimeters 
on each side. Here's how it works. That postage-stamp sized metal plate
is studded with a hundred skinny needles and coated with a metal 
that has a low melting point, like indium. A metal grid sits above the needles, and an electric field is set up
between the grid and the plate. When the plate is heated,
the indium melts and capillary action draws 
the liquid metal up the needles. The electric field tugs 
the molten metal upwards, while surface tension pulls it back, causing the indium to deform into a cone. The small radius of the tips 
of the needles makes it possible for the electric field
to overcome the surface tension, and when that happens, positively charged ions shoot off at
speeds of tens of kilometers per second. That stream of ions propels the spacecraft
in the opposite direction, thanks to Newton's third law. And while each ion 
is an extremely small particle, the combined force of so many of them
pushing away from the craft is enough to generate 
significant acceleration. And unlike the exhaust 
that pours out of a rocket engine, this stream is much smaller
and far more fuel efficient, which makes it better suited
for long deep-space missions. These micropropulsion systems
haven't been fully tested yet, but some scientists think that they
will provide enough thrust to break small craft out of Earth's orbit. In fact, they're predicting that thousands
of microspacecraft will be launched in the next ten years to gather data that today 
we can only dream about. And that is micro-rocket science.

You probably know the feeling. Your phone utters 
its final plaintive "bleep" and cuts out in the middle of your call. In that moment, you may feel more
like throwing your battery across the room than singing its praises, but batteries are a triumph of science. They allow smartphones 
and other technologies to exist without anchoring us 
to an infernal tangle of power cables. Yet even the best batteries
will diminish daily, slowly losing capacity 
until they finally die. So why does this happen, and how do our batteries even store
so much charge in the first place? It all started in the 1780s
with two Italian scientists, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, and a frog. Legend has it that as Galvani
was studying a frog's leg, he brushed a metal instrument 
up against one of its nerves, making the leg muscles jerk. Galvani called this animal electricity, believing that a type of electricity
was stored in the very stuff of life. But Volta disagreed, arguing that it was the metal itself
that made the leg twitch. The debate was eventually settled
with Volta's groundbreaking experiment. He tested his idea with a stack
of alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper or cloth
soaked in a salt water solution. What happened in Volta's cell is something
chemists now call oxidation and reduction. The zinc oxidizes,
which means it loses electrons, which are, in turn, gained by the ions in
the water in a process called reduction, producing hydrogen gas. Volta would have been shocked 
to learn that last bit. He thought the reaction 
was happening in the copper, rather than the solution. None the less, 
we honor Volta's discovery today by naming our standard unit 
of electric potential "the volt." This oxidation-reduction cycle creates
a flow of electrons between two substances and if you hook a lightbulb 
or vacuum cleaner up between the two, you'll give it power. Since the 1700s, scientists have improved
on Volta's design. They've replaced the chemical solution
with dry cells filled with chemical paste, but the principle is the same. A metal oxidizes, 
sending electrons to do some work before they are regained 
by a substance being reduced. But any battery has a finite 
supply of metal, and once most of it has oxidized, 
the battery dies. So rechargeable batteries give us 
a temporary solution to this problem by making the oxidation-reduction 
process reversible. Electrons can flow back 
in the opposite direction with the application of electricity. Plugging in a charger draws 
the electricity from a wall outlet that drives the reaction 
to regenerate the metal, making more electrons available 
for oxidation the next time you need them. But even rechargeable batteries 
don't last forever. Over time, the repetition of this process
causes imperfections and irregularities in the metal's surface
that prevent it from oxidizing properly. The electrons are no longer available
to flow through a circuit and the battery dies. Some everyday rechargeable batteries will die after only hundreds 
of discharge-recharge cycles, while newer, advanced batteries
can survive and function for thousands. Batteries of the future 
may be light, thin sheets that operate on the principles 
of quantum physics and last for hundreds 
of thousands of charge cycles. But until scientists find a way 
to take advantage of motion to recharge your cell battery,
like cars do, or fit solar panels 
somewhere on your device, plugging your charger into the wall, rather than expending 
one battery to charge another is your best bet to forestall 
that fatal "bleep."

**Transcript**:
You probably know the feeling. Your phone utters 
its final plaintive "bleep" and cuts out in the middle of your call. In that moment, you may feel more
like throwing your battery across the room than singing its praises, but batteries are a triumph of science. They allow smartphones 
and other technologies to exist without anchoring us 
to an infernal tangle of power cables. Yet even the best batteries
will diminish daily, slowly losing capacity 
until they finally die. So why does this happen, and how do our batteries even store
so much charge in the first place? It all started in the 1780s
with two Italian scientists, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, and a frog. Legend has it that as Galvani
was studying a frog's leg, he brushed a metal instrument 
up against one of its nerves, making the leg muscles jerk. Galvani called this animal electricity, believing that a type of electricity
was stored in the very stuff of life. But Volta disagreed, arguing that it was the metal itself
that made the leg twitch. The debate was eventually settled
with Volta's groundbreaking experiment. He tested his idea with a stack
of alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper or cloth
soaked in a salt water solution. What happened in Volta's cell is something
chemists now call oxidation and reduction. The zinc oxidizes,
which means it loses electrons, which are, in turn, gained by the ions in
the water in a process called reduction, producing hydrogen gas. Volta would have been shocked 
to learn that last bit. He thought the reaction 
was happening in the copper, rather than the solution. None the less, 
we honor Volta's discovery today by naming our standard unit 
of electric potential "the volt." This oxidation-reduction cycle creates
a flow of electrons between two substances and if you hook a lightbulb 
or vacuum cleaner up between the two, you'll give it power. Since the 1700s, scientists have improved
on Volta's design. They've replaced the chemical solution
with dry cells filled with chemical paste, but the principle is the same. A metal oxidizes, 
sending electrons to do some work before they are regained 
by a substance being reduced. But any battery has a finite 
supply of metal, and once most of it has oxidized, 
the battery dies. So rechargeable batteries give us 
a temporary solution to this problem by making the oxidation-reduction 
process reversible. Electrons can flow back 
in the opposite direction with the application of electricity. Plugging in a charger draws 
the electricity from a wall outlet that drives the reaction 
to regenerate the metal, making more electrons available 
for oxidation the next time you need them. But even rechargeable batteries 
don't last forever. Over time, the repetition of this process
causes imperfections and irregularities in the metal's surface
that prevent it from oxidizing properly. The electrons are no longer available
to flow through a circuit and the battery dies. Some everyday rechargeable batteries will die after only hundreds 
of discharge-recharge cycles, while newer, advanced batteries
can survive and function for thousands. Batteries of the future 
may be light, thin sheets that operate on the principles 
of quantum physics and last for hundreds 
of thousands of charge cycles. But until scientists find a way 
to take advantage of motion to recharge your cell battery,
like cars do, or fit solar panels 
somewhere on your device, plugging your charger into the wall, rather than expending 
one battery to charge another is your best bet to forestall 
that fatal "bleep."

There's a common misconception that if you like to meticulously 
organize your things, keep your hands clean, or plan out your weekend 
to the last detail, you might have OCD. In fact, OCD, which stands 
for obsessive compulsive disorder, is a serious psychiatric condition that is frequently 
misunderstood by society and mental health professionals alike. So let's start by debunking some myths. Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic
behaviors are synonymous with OCD. As its name suggests, obsessive compulsive disorder
has two aspects: the intrusive thoughts, images,
or impulses, known as obsessions, and the behavioral 
compulsions people engage in to relieve the anxiety 
the obsessions cause. The kinds of actions that people often 
associate with OCD, like excessive hand washing,
or checking things repeatedly, may be examples of obsessive
or compulsive tendencies that many of us exhibit from time to time. But the actual disorder is far more rare
and can be quite debilitating. People affected have little or no
control over their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which tend to be time consuming and interfere with work, 
school or social life to the point of causing 
significant distress. This set of diagnostic criteria is what
separates people suffering from OCD from those who may 
just be a bit more meticulous or hygiene obsessed than usual. Myth two: the main symptom of OCD
is excessive hand washing. Although hand washing is the most common
image of OCD in popular culture, obsessions and compulsions
can take many different forms. Obsessions can manifest 
as fears of contamination and illness, worries about harming others, or preoccupations with numbers,
patterns, morality, or sexual identity. And compulsions can range from
excessive cleaning or double checking, to the fastidious arrangement of objects, or walking in predetermined patterns. Myth three: individuals with OCD don't understand
that they are acting irrationally. Many individuals with OCD actually
understand the relationship between their obsessions 
and compulsions quite well. Being unable to avoid 
these thoughts and actions despite being aware of their irrationality is part of the reason
why OCD is so distressing. OCD sufferers report feeling crazy for experiencing anxiety 
based on irrational thoughts and finding it difficult 
to control their responses. So what exactly causes OCD? The frustrating answer 
is we don't really know. However, we have some important clues. OCD is considered 
a neurobiological disorder. In other words, research suggests 
that OCD sufferers brains are actually hardwired 
to behave in a certain fashion. Research has implicated 
three regions of the brain variously involved in social behavior
and complex cognitive planning, voluntary movement, and emotional and motivational responses. The other piece of the puzzle is that OCD is associated 
with low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter 
that communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, 
body temperature and pain. But are serotonin and activity 
in these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown
underlying cause of the disorder. We probably won't know until we have a much more intimate 
understanding of the brain. The good news is there are 
effective treatments for OCD, including medications, which increase
serotonin in the brain by limiting its reabsorption 
by brain cells, behavioral therapy that gradually
desensitizes patients to their anxieties, and in some cases, 
electroconvulsive therapy, or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond
to other forms of treatment. Knowing that your own brain 
is lying to you while not being able 
to resist its commands can be agonizing. But with knowledge and understanding
comes the power to seek help, and future research into the brain may finally provide 
the answers we're looking for.

with low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter 
that communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, 
body temperature and pain. But are serotonin and activity

**Transcript**:
There's a common misconception that if you like to meticulously 
organize your things, keep your hands clean, or plan out your weekend 
to the last detail, you might have OCD. In fact, OCD, which stands 
for obsessive compulsive disorder, is a serious psychiatric condition that is frequently 
misunderstood by society and mental health professionals alike. So let's start by debunking some myths. Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic
behaviors are synonymous with OCD. As its name suggests, obsessive compulsive disorder
has two aspects: the intrusive thoughts, images,
or impulses, known as obsessions, and the behavioral 
compulsions people engage in to relieve the anxiety 
the obsessions cause. The kinds of actions that people often 
associate with OCD, like excessive hand washing,
or checking things repeatedly, may be examples of obsessive
or compulsive tendencies that many of us exhibit from time to time. But the actual disorder is far more rare
and can be quite debilitating. People affected have little or no
control over their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which tend to be time consuming and interfere with work, 
school or social life to the point of causing 
significant distress. This set of diagnostic criteria is what
separates people suffering from OCD from those who may 
just be a bit more meticulous or hygiene obsessed than usual. Myth two: the main symptom of OCD
is excessive hand washing. Although hand washing is the most common
image of OCD in popular culture, obsessions and compulsions
can take many different forms. Obsessions can manifest 
as fears of contamination and illness, worries about harming others, or preoccupations with numbers,
patterns, morality, or sexual identity. And compulsions can range from
excessive cleaning or double checking, to the fastidious arrangement of objects, or walking in predetermined patterns. Myth three: individuals with OCD don't understand
that they are acting irrationally. Many individuals with OCD actually
understand the relationship between their obsessions 
and compulsions quite well. Being unable to avoid 
these thoughts and actions despite being aware of their irrationality is part of the reason
why OCD is so distressing. OCD sufferers report feeling crazy for experiencing anxiety 
based on irrational thoughts and finding it difficult 
to control their responses. So what exactly causes OCD? The frustrating answer 
is we don't really know. However, we have some important clues. OCD is considered 
a neurobiological disorder. In other words, research suggests 
that OCD sufferers brains are actually hardwired 
to behave in a certain fashion. Research has implicated 
three regions of the brain variously involved in social behavior
and complex cognitive planning, voluntary movement, and emotional and motivational responses. The other piece of the puzzle is that OCD is associated 
with low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter 
that communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, 
body temperature and pain. But are serotonin and activity 
in these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown
underlying cause of the disorder. We probably won't know until we have a much more intimate 
understanding of the brain. The good news is there are 
effective treatments for OCD, including medications, which increase
serotonin in the brain by limiting its reabsorption 
by brain cells, behavioral therapy that gradually
desensitizes patients to their anxieties, and in some cases,

**Transcript**:
In Islamic culture, 
geometry is everywhere. You can find it in mosques,
madrasas, palaces and private homes. This tradition began in the 8th century CE
during the early history of Islam, when craftsmen took preexisting motifs
from Roman and Persian cultures and developed them into new forms
of visual expression. This period of history was a golden age
of Islamic culture, during which many achievements 
of previous civilizations were preserved and further developed, resulting in fundamental advancements
in scientific study and mathematics. Accompanying this was an increasingly
sophisticated use of abstraction and complex geometry in Islamic art, from intricate floral motifs
adorning carpets and textiles, to patterns of tilework that seemed
to repeat infinitely, inspiring wonder 
and contemplation of eternal order. Despite the remarkable complexity
of these designs, they can be created 
with just a compass to draw circles and a ruler to make lines within them. And from these simple tools emerges 
a kaleidoscope multiplicity of patterns. So how does that work? Well, everything starts with a circle. The first major decision 
is how will you divide it up? Most patterns split the circle
into four, five or six equal sections. And each division gives rise
to distinctive patterns. There's an easy way to determine
whether any pattern is based on fourfold, fivefold, or sixfold symmetry. Most contain stars surrounded
by petal shapes. Counting the number 
of rays on a starburst, or the number of petals around it, tells us what category 
the pattern falls into. A star with six rays,
or surrounded by six petals, belongs in the sixfold category. One with eight petals is part
of the fourfold category, and so on. There's another secret ingredient
in these designs: an underlying grid. Invisible, but essential to every pattern, the grid helps determine the scale
of the composition before work begins, keeps the pattern accurate, and facilitates the invention 
of incredible new patterns. Let's look at an example of how these
elements come together. We'll start with a circle within a square,
and divide it into eight equal parts. We can then draw a pair
of criss-crossing lines and overlay them with another two. These lines are called construction lines, and by choosing a set of their segments, we'll form the basis 
of our repeating pattern. Many different designs are possible
from the same construction lines just by picking different segments. And the full pattern finally emerges when we create a grid with many
repetitions of this one tile in a process called tessellation. By choosing a different set 
of construction lines, we might have created this pattern, or this one. The possibilities are virtually endless. We can follow the same steps
to create sixfold patterns by drawing construction lines
over a circle divided into six parts, and then tessellating it,
we can make something like this. Here's another sixfold pattern
that has appeared across the centuries and all over the Islamic world, including Marrakesh, Agra, Konya
and the Alhambra. Fourfold patterns fit in a square grid,
and sixfold patterns in a hexagonal grid. Fivefold patterns, however,
are more challenging to tessellate because pentagons 
don't neatly fill a surface, so instead of just creating 
a pattern in a pentagon, other shapes have to be added
to make something that is repeatable, resulting in patterns that may seem
confoundingly complex, but are still relatively simple to create. Also, tessellation is not constrained
to simple geometric shapes, as M.C. Escher's work demonstrates. And while the Islamic 
geometric design tradition doesn't tend to employ elements 
like fish and faces, it does sometimes make use of multiple 
shapes to craft complex patterns. This more than 1,000-year-old tradition
has wielded basic geometry to produce works that are intricate,
decorative and pleasing to the eye. And these craftsmen prove just how
much is possible with some artistic intuition, creativity,
dedication and a great compass and ruler.
