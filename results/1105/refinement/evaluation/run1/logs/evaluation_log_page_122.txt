**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has a similar theme and intent.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the conception of the second set of twins, and the correct option is "From the spit of Jun." While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks about the conception, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the theme of the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, which asks about what happened to Junajpu's head in the House of Bats. But this is not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are more closely related to the ground truth MCQ. 

If I had to choose an answer from the provided options, I would say that there is no good match.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question has a similar intent to the ground truth MCQ, as it asks about the purpose or goal of the twins' actions in the story. While the ground truth MCQ specifically asks about the function of the ball game, Question 4 asks about the ultimate goal of the twin brothers in their match against the lords of the underworld. 

The correct option for Question 4, "To defeat the lords and free humanity from their suffering," aligns with the correct option for the ground truth MCQ, "to allow humans to prove themselves." Both options suggest that the ball game serves as a means for humans to demonstrate their worth or capabilities, and ultimately to gain freedom from the lords' oppression.

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 4.

**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8, but it only partially matches the ground truth MCQ. However, a closer examination reveals that Question 8's correct option only matches one part of the ground truth MCQ's correct option. 

A more thorough examination shows that the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ is "D. Both A and C". This indicates that we are looking for a generated MCQ that matches both parts of the correct option. 

While there isn't a perfect match among the generated MCQs, we can see that Question 8 matches one part of the correct option, and another part of the correct option can be found in the correct option of Question 6's description, but not in its options.

However, Question 8's correct option and Question 9's correct option's description, when combined, match the ground truth MCQ's correct option's description. But again, this isn't a perfect match.

Given the available generated MCQs, the closest match would be Question 8.

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth 
investigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance 
to catch their breath— and some z’s...

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth 
investigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance 
to catch their breath— and some z’s...

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching.

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the

as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to

exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created

conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of

- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching.

for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant

**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

**Transcript**:
Day after day, the twin brothers,
Jun and Wuqub, ran back and forth playing ball. One day, their vigorous game disturbed
the lords of the underworld, who challenged the twins to a match. But when the brothers arrived, 
the lords trapped and killed them, hanging Jun’s head 
from a tree as a trophy. The tree soon sprouted massive fruit, which caught the attention 
of one of the lords’ daughters. When she reached for it, 
the skull of Jun spat on her hand and impregnated her. Fleeing of her father’s wrath, she sought refuge with her mother-in-law
and gave birth to twin sons: Junajpu and Ixb’alanke. The second generation of twins discovered 
their father’s ballgame equipment, which their grandmother had hidden, 
and began to play. Soon enough, the messengers 
from the underworld arrived to issue another challenge. Knowing what had happened
to their fathers, the twins nevertheless answered the call, trekking through deep caverns and across rivers filled 
with scorpions, blood, and pus, until they reached the great city from which the lords of the underworld
controlled every aspect of nature and caused suffering for humans. The twins pressed on, searching 
for the lords who had challenged them. The lords had hidden among statues 
of themselves to confuse their guests, but the brothers sent a mosquito 
ahead of them. When it stung the figures, 
the lords cried out, revealing themselves. They forced the twins to spend 
the night in the House of Darkness. They gave them a torch, but warned they
must return it unburnt or face death. As the darkness closed in, the quick-thinking brothers 
adorned the torch with red macaw feathers and fireflies. Come morning, the lords were shocked
to see the torch lit, but unburnt. They insisted on playing the game
with their own ball. The twins agreed, only to find 
that the lords had hidden a weapon inside the ball, which chased them around the court,
trying to kill them. The twins survived that first round, but by now they were sure 
this would be no ordinary match. They played many more rounds, and each time the twins scored
no better than a tie, leaving them to face 
whatever supernatural trial the lords set for them 
before picking up the game again. They survived the House of Cold
by lighting a fire, and the House of Jaguars by feeding
bones to the beasts. But in the House of Bats, 
a bat bit off Junajpu’s head. Certain they now had the advantage, the lords called for another round 
of the ballgame, hanging Junajpu’s head over the court. The quick-thinking Ixb’alanke
called the animals to him. A turtle brought him a chilacayote squash, and he carved it into the likeness 
of a head. While the lords chased the ball,
he swapped it with the head. With Junajpu’s head back on his body,
the twins played harder than ever. Finally, they won the game, hitting the hanging squash 
so it shattered on the ground. The twins knew their treacherous hosts
would not take the loss well. To protect themselves,
they enlisted a pair of seers. Sure enough, the lords burned
the brothers in an oven, but the seers made sure their remains
were thrown in the river, which restored them to life. The brothers then came before the lords
disguised as two disheveled children and began to dance and perform miracles. For their final trick, 
Ixb’alanke pretended to kill Junajpu, then resurrect him. The lords were so delighted 
that they demanded the same trick be performed on them. Still in disguise, the brothers were 
only too happy to oblige, and began killing the lords one by one. As the surviving lords realized 
who stood before them and that no resurrection was forthcoming, they begged for mercy,
and the twins spoke their curse. Henceforth, the lords would have
no sacrifices and no power over the surface world. Their days of terrorizing humans 
were over.

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth 
investigating with a doctor. After all, everyone needs a chance 
to catch their breath— and some z’s...

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A leather mask that clamps the mouth shut. A cannonball sewn 
into a soldier’s uniform. And a machine that delivers 
sudden electrical pulses. These old items were all
intended treatments for a problem that has haunted humanity
for millennia: snoring. It might seem harmless, but snoring can
be a sign of something more dangerous. So, what exactly causes snoring? 
And when does it become a problem? A snore’s quality can range from a
gentle mew to a stuttering chainsaw— but all snores originate 
from the respiratory tract, which is lined with soft tissues. During sleep, the muscles 
around these tissues relax, narrowing the airway. Many factors, including congestion, 
anatomical features, and the position you’re sleeping in, can further constrict this passage 
and lead to or exacerbate snoring. The narrower the respiratory tract is,
the stronger the airflow, and the more those relaxed tissues 
may vibrate, producing sound. Most of us will snore at some point
in our lives. But loud, chronic snoring is one sign 
of a sleep disorder known as obstructive sleep apnea. It affects about a quarter of all adults, but it’s estimated that around 80%
of people who suffer from it aren’t aware they have it. This is especially troublesome because it 
can lead to serious cardiovascular issues. Obstructive sleep apnea is usually
caused by blockages in the airway and is mainly characterized by pauses
in breathing during sleep. There's one other kind of sleep apnea
called central sleep apnea, which occurs when the brain temporarily
fails to regulate the body's breathing. This condition isn't as common, and snoring is usually 
a less prominent feature— though you can have both. If you’re experiencing 
obstructive sleep apnea, you might stop breathing for 10 or more
seconds before waking, sometimes without realizing it,
to catch your breath. In doing so, you might make 
a snorting or a choking sound. This may happen five times an hour, though in severe cases,
it could occur more than 30. And it's a problem because your tissues
are getting less oxygen. As you experience periods
of low oxygen intake, your body releases stress hormones. And your blood vessels constrict to get
oxygenated blood to your vital organs. This increases your blood pressure 
and puts additional stress on your heart. And this is why obstructive sleep apnea
can be linked to hypertension and other cardiovascular problems. Your difficulty breathing and poor-quality
rest may also lead to headaches, decreased concentration,
and chronic fatigue. So what puts someone at risk of developing
obstructive sleep apnea? Features like larger tongues, 
thicker necks, and smaller jaws can make people more susceptible. Older people are more at risk 
because, as we age, our soft tissues loosen,
further narrowing our airways. Drinking alcohol before going to sleep
can cause excessive relaxation of our throat and jaw muscles. And one of the main contributors 
to obstructive sleep apnea is weight gain because more tissue around the neck
can constrict the airway. Many researchers see weight loss 
as a solution to obstructive sleep apnea. Certain behavioral shifts, like limiting
your alcohol consumption before bed, elevating your head, and avoiding 
sleeping on your back may also help. For people who have a milder condition, mouth and throat exercises have been shown
to alleviate obstructive sleep apnea in some preliminary trials. But these approaches, 
and devices like oral appliances, may not always be sufficient. Sleep apnea can be reliably
treated using CPAP machines, which keep the airway open by delivering
a constant stream of pressurized air. Doctors will usually aim to remedy sleep
apnea with non-invasive treatments like these first, but if they don’t work,
they may consider surgery. Snores can be silly. But intense ones are well-worth

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

**Transcript**:
These eight ferocious notes open one of the most explosive pieces
of music ever composed. Ludwig van Beethoven’s 
Symphony Number Five premiered in 1808, 
on a blisteringly cold Vienna night. The piece was just one small part
of a lengthy program, and the orchestra had been hastily
assembled and under-rehearsed. But despite this inauspicious premiere,
the symphony quickly won acclaim. One critic likened the piece 
to “glowing beams of light, piercing through the darkness.” This intensity persists
throughout the composition, and its dramatic musicality continues
to move listeners today. So what exactly makes 
Beethoven’s Fifth so captivating? When the symphony premiered, Beethoven
already had a formidable reputation. While his peers produced music exclusively
for religious functions or private events held by their wealthy patrons, Beethoven was one of the first
freelance composers. He made his living 
composing and selling his music to publishers in multiple countries and showcasing his compositions
to an adoring public. This career choice gave him the 
flexibility to compose for self-expression and Beethoven was always pursuing new ways to translate his powerful emotions 
into music. At the time, most composers worked
within the Classical style, which offered limited options 
for a piece’s overarching structure and instrumentation. Beethoven composed most 
of his earlier pieces in this tradition, following in the footsteps 
of role models like Mozart and Haydn. But with his Fifth Symphony, he
experimented with elements of Romanticism. This blossoming mode of composition was
known for its expressive melodies, extended forms 
and surprising instrumentations. The first movement of Beethoven’s Fifth
uses a Classical sonata form, in which a central musical idea 
is explored, developed, and repeated in an altered manner. Within these parameters, he explores 
a simple idea with incredible depth. A single rhythmic motif serves as the 
building block for most of the movement: three short notes, 
followed by a lingering fourth. One of Beethoven’s biographers would 
later call this pattern the “fate motif,” because it suggests
the figure of fate knocking at the door. While it's not clear if Beethoven composed
the motif with fate in mind, these notes certainly create
a gripping hook. The rhythmic pattern creates
forward movement, while the prolonged fourth note 
signals doom. This motif haunts the symphony, including its accompanying parts
and rhythmic flourishes. Beethoven experiments with dozens 
of variations, playing out across different 
instruments and pitches. Throughout the piece, this motif is passed
around the orchestra like a whisper, gradually reaching more and more 
instruments until it becomes a roar. The motif’s inventive repetition 
is a large part of what makes this piece so memorable, but it’s not the only innovation 
on display. This was the first major orchestral
composition to use trombones, and Beethoven also employs 
a high-pitched piccolo and a low-pitched contrabassoon to give the orchestra a wider range 
than most classical compositions. Exaggerated musical dynamics
further heighten the drama. And harmonically, the piece has
a clear emotional arc— beginning in a somber C minor 
and ending in a triumphant C major. This progression, from ominous unease
to majestic resolution, is a testament to Beethoven’s ability 
to inject raw emotionality into his music. He wrote this symphony 
while battling with hearing loss, and his anguish can be heard 
in the composition’s thunderous and repeating musical phrases. Beethoven continued to compose even
after he became completely deaf, producing innovative music
until his death in 1827. And the Fifth Symphony’s central motif 
has continued to resound through the ages. Outside of concert halls, the piece has become a symbol 
for suspense, revelation, and triumph. The fate motif sounds out the letter V 
in Morse code, and during World War II, the Fifth Symphony became a code 
for victory amongst the Allies. The iconic composition can
be found in film scores, and it’s even been explored through
musical reinterpretations and visual art. But whatever the context, Beethoven’s Fifth takes its listeners 
through a dark world, then guides them into the light.

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn

**Transcript**:
- This is the most dangerous
problem in mathematics, one that young mathematicians are warned not to waste their time on. It's a simple conjecture that not even the world's
best mathematicians have been able to solve. Paul Erdos, a famous mathematician, said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." Here's how it works. Pick a number, any number. Seven? Good choice. Okay, we're gonna apply two rules. If the number is odd, we
multiply by three and add one. So three times seven
is 21, plus one is 22. If the number is even, we divide by two. So 22 divided by two is 11. Now, we keep applying these two rules. 11 is odd, so we multiply
by 3, 33, and add 1, 34. Even, divide by two, 17, odd. Multiply by 3, 51, add 1, 52, even. Divide by two, 26, still even. Divide by two, 13, odd. So we multiply by 3, 39,
add one, and that's 40, which is even, so we divide by two, 20, divide by two, 10,
divide by two, five, odd. Multiply by three, 15, add one, 16, divide by two that's eight,
and then four, two, and one. Now, one is odd, so we
multiply by three and add one, which equals four. But four goes to two, goes to one, so we're in a loop, and
the lowest number is one. Now, the conjecture is this: every positive integer,
if you apply these rules, will eventually end up in
the four, two, one loop. This is commonly called
the Collatz conjecture after German mathematician,
Luther Collatz, who may have come up with it in the 1930s. But the problem has many
origin stories and many names. It's also known as the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem, and simply 3N+1. Why is 3x+1 so famous? - Among professional mathematicians, maybe it's not famous but infamous, in the sense that if someone
actually admits in public that they're working on it, then there's something wrong with them. (laughs) - [Narrator] The numbers
you get by applying 3x+1 are called hailstone numbers, because they go up and down like hailstones in a thundercloud, but eventually, they all fall down to one, or at least we think they do. You can think of the numbers as representing the height
above the ground in meters. So a number like 26 would start
26 meters above the ground. And if you apply 3x+1, it rises up as high as 40 meters. And, in total, it takes
10 steps to get to one. So 10 is called its total stopping time. But take the very next number, 27, and it bounces around all over the place. In fact, it climbs all
the way up to 9,232. As an altitude, that is
higher than Mount Everest, before it too falls back to the ground. In total, it takes 111 steps
for 27 to get down to one and end up in the four, two, one loop. The paths that different
numbers take vary so widely, even numbers right next to each other. So how do you even start to
make progress on this problem? Well, honestly, mathematicians struggled. - People just decided that this was something
invented by the Soviets to slow down U.S. science, and it was doing a good job at it 'cause everybody's sitting
there twiddling their thumbs and making no progress
on this trivial thing that you can tell a school of children. - [Narrator] Jeffrey Lagarias is the world authority on 3x+1. - The first time I met him
I was a senior in college, and he pulled me aside and
he said, "Don't do this. Don't work on this problem. If you want to have a career, do not start spending
time writing about this or publishing any papers about this. Do real math for a while
to establish yourself." - [Narrator] Alex
Kontorovich didn't listen. He and Yakov Sinai looked at the paths of
the hailstone numbers. Were there any patterns? But obviously all of them ended up at one. But what about the paths
they take to get there? The pattern is randomness. Here is the sequence of a
large number chosen at random. The graph peaks and then drop so low that you can't really see
what's happening at this scale. But if you take the logarithm, you find this wiggly graph
with a downward trend. It looks like the stock
market on a bad day. And this is no coincidence. Both are examples of
geometric Brownian motion. That means if you take the log
and remove the linear trend, the fluctuations are random. It's like flipping a coin each step. If the coin is heads, the line goes up, tails, it goes down. 3x+1 is just like the random
wiggles of the stock market. Over long-enough periods, the stock market tends to trend upwards, while 3x+1 trends down. Another way to analyze 3x+1 is by looking at the
leading digit of each number in a sequence. Here are the hailstone
numbers starting with three as the seed. And we can count up how many
numbers start with a one, how many start with a two, how many start with a three,
and so on to make a histogram. We can do the same thing for the sequence that starts with four,
and that's a short one, and for the sequences that
start with five, six, and seven. Again, for each sequence, we're just counting up how many numbers start with each digit, one through nine, and adding that to our histogram. If you keep doing this
for more and more numbers, eventually the histogram
settles into a stable pattern. For the first billion sequences, you'll find one is by far the
most common leading digit. 30% of all numbers start with one, around 17.5% start with
two, 12% start with three, and the frequency decreases
for higher digits. Fewer than 5% of all the
numbers start with nine. Now, this pattern is not unique to 3x+1. It actually comes up everywhere, from the populations of countries, to the value of companies, all the physical constants
and the Fibonacci numbers, just to name a few. The distribution is
known as Benford's law, and it is even used to detect fraud. If all the numbers on
your income tax forms obey Benford's law, then, well, you're probably being honest. If not, you may be hiding something. In elections, Benford's law can be used to spot irregularities, though you have to apply it correctly. Benford's law works best
when the numbers involved span several orders of magnitude as they do for 3x+1. But Benford's law can't tell us whether all numbers will end up in the four, two, one loop or not. For that, we need a
different sort of analysis. Now, at first glance, it seems strange that when you apply 3x+1, all numbers should end up at one. I mean, consider that
there are the same number of odd and even numbers, but odd numbers are more than tripled, while even numbers are only cut in half. Therefore, it seems like
every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link

every sequence on average should grow, not shrink. But here's the catch. Every time you multiply
an odd number by three and then add one, it will
always become an even number, and that means the next
step is to divide by two. So odd numbers are not
actually tripled by 3x+1. They're increased by a factor
of about three over two. I'm neglecting the plus one because it's insignificant
for large numbers. And 3/2 is actually the most an odd number can grow in one step. Think of the path from one
odd number in a sequence to the next odd number. After multiplying by three and adding one, you have an even number. And 50% of the time, dividing by two brings
you back to an odd number. But a quarter of the time,
you can divide by four before you get to the next odd number. So, for a quarter of numbers, the next one in the sequence will be 3/4 of its initial value. An 1/8 the time, you can divide by eight before getting to the next odd number, and 1/16 of the time, you
can divide by 16 and so on. If you take the geometric mean, you find, on average, to
get from one odd number to the next one, you
multiply by three over four, which is less than one. So statistically speaking, 3x+1 sequences are more
likely to shrink than grow. Take 341 for example, multiply by three and
add one, you get 1,024, which you can divide by two and then divide by two again, and again, and again, and again, 10 times in total until
you're down to one. One way to visualize these
paths of numbers in 3x+1 is simply to show how each number connects to the next one in its sequence. This is called a directed graph. It looks like a tree or a
series of little streams that flow into each other. If the conjecture is true, it means that every single number is connected to this graph. Every tiny stream all
the way out to infinity eventually flows into the
massive river of four, two, one. Some mathematicians have
modified this visualization by rotating the graph at each number; anticlockwise if it's an odd number, and clockwise if it's even. And then you end up with a structure that looks like a coral or seaweed. And by adjusting the degree of rotation for odd and even numbers, you can create these beautiful,
organic-looking shapes. Now, there are two ways the
conjecture could be false. There could be a number
somewhere, some seed, that starts a sequence of numbers that grows to infinity. For whatever reason, it doesn't obey the same numerical gravity as all of the other numbers. Another possibility is there
exists a sequence of numbers that forms a closed loop. All the numbers in this loop would be unconnected to the main graph. But thus far, no loop or sequence that shoots off
to infinity has been found. And not for lack of trying, mathematicians have tested by brute force every single number up to two to the 68. That's 295,147,905,179,352,825,856
numbers. We know, for certain, that every
single one of those numbers eventually comes back down to one. We have tested nearly
300 quintillion numbers, and none of them disproves the conjecture. In fact, given this information, mathematicians calculate that any loop other than four, two, one must be at least 186 billion numbers long. So, it seems pretty likely
that the conjecture is true, but this doesn't prove it. One way mathematicians
have attempted to prove it is by making a scatterplot with all the seed numbers on the x-axis and a number from each seeds
sequence on the y-axis. Now, if you can show that
in every 3x+1 sequence there is a number that is
smaller than the original seed, well then you have proven
the Collatz conjecture, because whatever number you pick, you know it will at
some point get smaller, and that smaller number as
a seed also gets smaller, and so on down to one, meaning the only way any sequence can end is in the four, two, one loop. This has not yet been shown. But, in 1976, Riho Terras was able to show that almost all Collatz sequences reach a point below their initial value. In 1979, this limit was reduced with almost all numbers going to less than X
to the power of 0.869. And then in 1994, it was further lowered to less than X to the power of 0.7925. In this case, the term almost all numbers has a technical mathematical definition. It means that as the
numbers you're looking at go to infinity, the fraction that end up
under the curve goes to one. Then in 2019, one of the world's greatest
living mathematicians, Terry Tao, was able to show 3x+1 obeys even stricter criteria. He showed almost all
numbers will end up smaller than any arbitrary function f of x so long as that function goes to infinity as x goes to infinity. But the function can rise
as slowly as you like. So, log x is an example, or
log, log, log x works too, or log, log, log, log x. What this means is,
for almost all numbers, you can guarantee that there
is an arbitrarily small number somewhere in its sequence. In a public talk he gave
in 2020, Terry Tao said, "This is about as close as one can get to the Collatz conjecture
without actually solving it." This is an impressive result,
but it's still not a proof. So why can't we prove the conjecture true? Could it be because it's not true? I mean, everyone is
trying to prove it true, which means almost no one is
looking for counterexamples. - It had happened to
me just two years ago, where there was something
I was trying to prove, that I was trying for
three years to prove, and I couldn't get it to work. And then I found a counterexample, and then I realized what
the correct statement should have been. And then a month later, I
proved the correct statement. Maybe we should be spending more energy looking for counterexamples
than we're currently spending. - [Narrator] I mean,
remember how the number 27 grows all the way to 9,232? Here is a plot of seed
numbers up to 10,000, with the largest number
reached for each seed plotted on the y-axis. The y-axis stops at a 100,000, but not all numbers can
be shown at this scale. The seed 9,663, for example,
climbs as high as 27 million. And as yet, no one has proven why a number couldn't just
shoot off to infinity. And it would take only one
to disprove the conjecture, or some set of numbers
could be part of a loop not connected to the main graph. As far as we know, there is
only one loop: four, two, one. But something strange happens if you include negative numbers. Applying the same 3x+1 rules as before, there is not one loop, not two loops, but three independent loops of numbers. And they start at low
values like -17 and -5. Why should there be disconnected loops on the negative side of the number line, but not on the positive side? Now, one of the most
convincing pieces of evidence supporting the conjecture
is Terry Tao's proof that almost all numbers have
a number in their sequence that is arbitrarily small. But proving that almost all
numbers obey this criteria isn't the same thing as
proving that all numbers do. How many numbers between one
and 100 are perfect squares? The answer is 10. So, 10% of numbers up to
100 are perfect squares. How many numbers between one
and 1,000 are perfect squares? The answer is 31. So only 3.1% of the numbers up
to 1,000 are perfect squares. And the higher you go, the
smaller this percentage becomes, such that in the limit, you could say almost all numbers are
not perfect squares. The fraction of numbers that are not perfect squares goes to one as X goes to infinity. And yet we know there are an infinite
number of perfect squares and we know exactly where they are. Now, we've tested by brute force all numbers up to two to the 68, and they all obey the Collatz conjecture. And you might be thinking that,
well, we should have found a counterexample by this point. But on the scale of all numbers,
two to the 68 is nothing. I mean, the Polya
conjecture proposed in 1919 by George Polya asserted that the majority
of natural numbers up to any given number have an
odd number of prime factors. The conjecture was eventually proven false by C. Brian Haselgrove in 1958 when he identified a counterexample. What's remarkable is the
value of this counterexample was 1.845 times 10 to the 361. That's some 10 to 340 times bigger than all the numbers checked for 3x+1. One way to think about 3x+1 is as though it's a simple
program run on a turing machine. The seed number is the
input to the machine. So in this picture, two to the 68 is simply an input tape 68 squares long. You can think of them as
a string of ones and zeros or black and white squares. Saying the machine has
transformed every input up to this 68 square taped down to one should not give you a lot of confidence that it will do so for all inputs. In fact, it's fairly simple to calculate a number that shows any arbitrary behavior you
like, so long as it is finite. But if you want a number that
increases by three over two five consecutive times, you
can calculate that number. If you want a number that
climbs by three over two 10 times in a row, or
100 times or 1,000 times, you can easily calculate those numbers. But after the finite section you specify, you have no more control. And every that has ever been
tested, always falls to one. If there is a counterexample, it's virtually impossible
that someone's gonna guess it. And the space of all possibilities is too big to search
exhaustively by brute force. - Two to the 1,000 is
not a searchable space. So, if we're gonna find it, we have to find it by
some intelligent process and not by guess and check. I had been on team 3x+1 for 20 years. And then this point of view, I realized that, what do we really know? It's very hard to prove
a theorem that's false. And so, could it be that
everyone is struggling to prove this thing because
it's not actually true? And two to the 60 is
not a lot of evidence. And even the statistical
version is maybe true and not evidence for the non-existence of a divergent trajectory
somewhere in the 3x+1 sequence. - Of course there is another option, and that is that we'll never know, that the problem is undecidable. In 1987, John Conway created
a generalization of 3x+1. It was a mathematical machine
that he called FRACTRAN. And he was able to show this
machine is turing-complete, which means it can do anything
a modern computer can do, but it also means that it's
subject to the halting problem, a chance that the machine
never stops running and so doesn't give you an output. And this does not prove that 3x+1 is also subject
to the halting problem, but it is possible that
given what we know, we may never prove the Collatz
conjecture true or false. - You're gonna be taught in school that we know a bunch of
stuff, and it's a lie. They're all lies. Here's this stupid little problem. Come on, really we can't solve this? Really? You know, it just shows that math is hard. If anything, it shows
that all of the things that we can solve are miracles. We have no right to have solutions to all of these other problems. - For my whole life, I've thought of numbers as
these incredibly regular things full of patterns,
symmetry, and repetition. But what I'm realizing only now is just how peculiar numbers really are. You can see this most clearly
in the coral representation. From a simple mathematical operation comes something intricate,
organic-looking, and, thus far, intractable to us. Do all numbers connect to the structure, or is there some unique filament,
a spindly little thread, that doesn't connect to any of this, that runs off to infinity? And why is it so hard to tell? I think that's why Paul Erdos said, "Mathematics is not yet ripe
enough for such questions." (gentle music) What I love about 3x+1 is it's a problem almost
anyone can understand and play around with. And actually trying to figure
things out for yourself is the best way to learn, which is why I subscribed to Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Now, recently, Brilliant have
upped their interactivity. For example, here is a great lesson on the Pythagorean theorem. So, you don't just remember the formula, but you really understand what it means. Now, Brilliant is a website and an app designed to get you thinking deeply by engaging you in problem-solving. It's one thing to read through a textbook and think that you get it, but it's quite another
to play with interactives and actually test yourself as you go, and Brilliant curates the experiences so they get more and more
challenging over time. There's always a helpful
tip or explanation that takes your understanding
to the next level. I'd highly recommend their course on mathematical fundamentals, which now has even more interactivity and it has topics that are
relevant to all areas of STEM and algorithm fundamentals for
anyone interested in coding. It's great to have a resource like this to inspire you to learn
something new every single day. I try to start off my day by challenging myself with Brilliant. And so if you'd like to join me and a community of 8
million other learners, go to brilliant.org/veritasium. I will put that link
down in the description. So I wanna thank Brilliant
for sponsoring this video, and I wanna thank you for watching.
