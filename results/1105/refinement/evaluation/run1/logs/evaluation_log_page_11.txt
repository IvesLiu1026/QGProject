Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest the most similar generated MCQ based on the question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the number of sounds each vowel makes. The closest generated MCQ that relates to the concept of vowel sounds is Question 3, which asks about the repetition of sounds in the song. However, it does not directly ask about the number of sounds each vowel makes.

A more relevant generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 3

Please note that the generated MCQs do not directly address the question of how many sounds each vowel makes, so the similarity is limited.

**Transcript**:
At the temple of the fisherman, 
Quexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and frowns. It’s a still morning–
unusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest 
in a series of troubling signs. The year is 1400 BCE. Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, 
treeless desert between the towering Andes 
and Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the sea, 
harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, 
and using them to build fishing boats. Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats
to hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest 
shellfish and sea urchins. In winter, storms bring powerful waves,
which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores. Most years, Quexo’s village catches 
more than enough fish. But this year, the winds have died 
and the fish have dwindled. Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, 
then the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve 
mud bricks and wash away settlements. He needs to stop the bad weather 
before the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual 
he’s been planning. Quexo spends much less time
in the ocean than the other villagers. He became a shaman after seeing 
a sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather
before him. This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain 
as the sun rises. There, he gathers ceremonial cactus 
and herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker," and valerian, 
along with the mineral hematite. Back in the village, 
everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival 
at a large temple inland. The festival marks the beginning of what
is usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms,
Quexo isn’t feeling too celebratory. Whole families travel to the festival,
where they camp for a few days. They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones,
gourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade 
in the market around the temple. Quexo inspects the goods to make 
sure everything is of the finest quality. He brings the herbs he gathered 
to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes 
from the highlands in the Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual 
to ward off the storms. Around lunchtime, the sprawling 
temple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along 
the coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions—
they’re looking for cotton and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed 
to do the trading, but shamans are an exception. Though Quexo is a man, during rituals 
he becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role 
more flexible outside ceremonies too. Quexo can’t find any cinnabar 
in the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza. He puts on his ceremonial garb: 
red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth
and vertebrae. Inside, the ceremonies 
are already underway, and the shamans have drunk
the sacred cactus drink. Many of them are Quexo’s friends 
from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans 
who would have cinnabar. He begins to panic. If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make 
the long walk into the mountains. It’s a dangerous journey 
that takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste. But perhaps he has no choice. He refuses the sacred cactus 
and sets off toward the mountains. As he leaves the settlement behind,
he sees a group approaching. He recognizes them as highlanders
by their llamas. He dashes toward their shaman. Barely pausing to say hello, 
he offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime
and chew with coca leaves. In return, the other shaman 
gives him the precious cinnabar. With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple 
of the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide.

**Transcript**:
At the temple of the fisherman, 
Quexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and frowns. It’s a still morning–
unusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest 
in a series of troubling signs. The year is 1400 BCE. Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, 
treeless desert between the towering Andes 
and Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the sea, 
harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, 
and using them to build fishing boats. Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats
to hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest 
shellfish and sea urchins. In winter, storms bring powerful waves,
which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores. Most years, Quexo’s village catches 
more than enough fish. But this year, the winds have died 
and the fish have dwindled. Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, 
then the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve 
mud bricks and wash away settlements. He needs to stop the bad weather 
before the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual 
he’s been planning. Quexo spends much less time
in the ocean than the other villagers. He became a shaman after seeing 
a sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather
before him. This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain 
as the sun rises. There, he gathers ceremonial cactus 
and herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker," and valerian, 
along with the mineral hematite. Back in the village, 
everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival 
at a large temple inland. The festival marks the beginning of what
is usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms,
Quexo isn’t feeling too celebratory. Whole families travel to the festival,
where they camp for a few days. They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones,
gourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade 
in the market around the temple. Quexo inspects the goods to make 
sure everything is of the finest quality. He brings the herbs he gathered 
to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes 
from the highlands in the Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual 
to ward off the storms. Around lunchtime, the sprawling 
temple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along 
the coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions—
they’re looking for cotton and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed 
to do the trading, but shamans are an exception. Though Quexo is a man, during rituals 
he becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role 
more flexible outside ceremonies too. Quexo can’t find any cinnabar 
in the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza. He puts on his ceremonial garb: 
red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth
and vertebrae. Inside, the ceremonies 
are already underway, and the shamans have drunk
the sacred cactus drink. Many of them are Quexo’s friends 
from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans 
who would have cinnabar. He begins to panic. If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make 
the long walk into the mountains. It’s a dangerous journey 
that takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste. But perhaps he has no choice. He refuses the sacred cactus 
and sets off toward the mountains. As he leaves the settlement behind,
he sees a group approaching. He recognizes them as highlanders
by their llamas. He dashes toward their shaman. Barely pausing to say hello, 
he offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime
and chew with coca leaves. In return, the other shaman 
gives him the precious cinnabar. With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple 
of the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a strategy to create a matching MCQ.

To create a matching MCQ, you can generate a question that asks about the usage of -TCH or -CH when a vowel makes a short sound and does not have a letter friend. Here's an example:

Generated MCQ:
Question: What suffix is used when a vowel makes a short sound and does not have a letter friend?
Options: A. -TCH, B. -CH
Correct Option: A

Since this MCQ is not present in the provided list, I will not provide an index. However, if you generate MCQs using the strategy mentioned above, you can compare them with the ground truth MCQ and identify the most similar one.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific event in the transcript, while the generated MCQs are about a different story and topic.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format (True or False) and the style of the question, I would say that there is no similar generated MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but only because it's the first question and not because of the content.

A more accurate answer would be that there is no similar generated MCQ, and a new question should be generated to match the ground truth MCQ.

If you want, I can help you generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. 

For example:
Question: True or False. The speaker forgot to feed the goldfish because it didn't look hungry.
Options: A. True, B. False
Correct Option: B

Or
Question: Why did the speaker not feed the goldfish initially?
Options: A. He forgot, B. It didn't look hungry, C. He didn't have food, D. He was busy

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the story "Elbow Grease" and its main character, while the generated MCQs are about a completely different topic, Japanese art and artists.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs have any resemblance to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say -1 or "Not Found" would be a more accurate response in this case.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about Elbow Grease's engine stopping during the Grand Prix race, while the generated MCQs are about Hokusai, a Japanese artist, and his art.

However, since I need to provide an answer, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 9 is the most similar, only because it mentions a specific event (the significance of the waterfall) and has options that are somewhat related to a story (although not the story of Elbow Grease). However, please note that this is a very weak match.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of Hokusai's artwork.

The generated MCQs are mostly about color theory, which is not directly related to the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest Question 7, which mentions the transcript, but it's still not a good match.

Since there is no good match, I will not provide an index. However, I can suggest creating a new generated MCQ that directly matches the ground truth MCQ. Here is an example:

Question: What is a common theme in Hokusai's artwork?
Options: A. The beauty and power of nature, B. The importance of traditional art, C. The use of bold colors, D. The depiction of urban landscapes

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the definition of a gradient in the context of color theory, while the generated MCQs are mostly about texture, which is not even mentioned in the provided transcript.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, as it mentions "value" which is a concept related to the ground truth MCQ. Nevertheless, the question intent and content are still quite different.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a way to create a similar MCQ.

A similar MCQ could be:
Question: What can be added to a color to change its value?
Options: A. black, B. white, C. grey, D. All of the above
Correct Option: D

Since this MCQ is not present in the generated MCQs, I will not provide an index. However, if I had to choose the most similar MCQ from the given options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if we look at the content of the transcript and the ground truth MCQ, a similar question could be created using Question 3 or Question 5 as a base, as they talk about using line, value, and repetition to show texture, and value is related to the lightness or darkness of a color.

However, the generated MCQs seem to be focused on texture, whereas the ground truth MCQ and the transcript are focused on color theory and value. Therefore, it's challenging to find a matching MCQ among the generated options.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the definition of texture, while the generated MCQs are about various topics related to chemistry and cleaning pennies.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format (True or False) and the simplicity of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the format of the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 6 is the closest in terms of simplicity, but it does not match the format (True or False) and the topic is not related to texture.

Since there is no matching generated MCQ, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are relevant to the topic of texture.

If I had to provide an index, I would say "No matching MCQ found".

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide the index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is about showing texture in a drawing, and the options are related to art techniques. None of the generated MCQs are related to texture or art techniques. However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar.

But if I really had to choose, I would say that Question 7 is the least dissimilar, only because it has an option "D. A variety of household items" which is similar to the ground truth MCQ's option "D. All of the above!". However, please note that this is a very weak similarity, and the question content and intent are completely different.

Index of the least dissimilar generated MCQ: 7 (Note: This is not a good match, and the generated MCQs do not align with the ground truth MCQ)

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs seem to be related to storytelling and the "five W's" (who, what, when, where, and why), whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the taste of acidic foods.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ could be:

Question: How do acidic foods typically taste?

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ exactly. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the most similar, but only because it has a "where" word (implied by "sequence") in the question and has options that include a location (implied by the numbers). However, this is a very weak connection.

A more accurate answer would be that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the concept of "where" in a story, while the generated MCQs are mostly about the song and its sequence of numbers.

If I had to provide an index, I would say -1 or "None" to indicate that there is no matching generated MCQ. However, if I had to choose a number, I would say 3, but with the caveat that it's a very weak connection.

Index: -1 (or 3 with the caveat mentioned above)

But if I had to choose one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to pick one, it would be "None of the above" since the generated MCQs do not match the topic or the intent of the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to choose one, I would say -1, indicating that there's no matching generated MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about counting by tens, while the generated MCQs are about a blobfish.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it is also a true/false question, I would say that there is no similar generated MCQ. But if I really had to choose I would say:

 Question 2 is a standard multiple choice question and so are the others, but question 2 has the closest amount of options to the ground truth question, however the questions are completely unrelated 

But I will provide the index of the question:

**Transcript**:
[Intro] [sad noises] Jessi: Oh hey, guys! We were just practicing
our sad faces. Ooo, good one, Squeaks! Chances are you can’t look any more miserable
than this deep-sea creature: Meet the blobfish! It’s got a pretty good reason to look so
bummed. It’s been called the world’s ugliest animal. Which really isn’t a nice thing to say. I mean, it might not be as cute as a panda
or a kitten, but the blobfish’s funny-looking body actually helps it to survive in its harsh
underwater environment. The blobfish lives in the ocean off the coast
of Australia. And it lives really, really deep. How deep? Almost at the sea floor -- that’s
nearly 10 times deeper than where most ocean animals live. Not many animals could survive where the blobfish
lives. Down there, it’s pitch-black because sunlight
can’t even reach that far; the temperature is just a few degrees above freezing; and
the pressure is extremely high. So what’s this pressure we’re talking
about? Well, if you’re at the bottom of the ocean, the weight of alllll the water
on top of you presses down really hard. And it squeezes you -- like a really, really tight
bear hug! So how does the blobfish survive with all
this intense pressure? Well, that’s where its “ugliness” is actually a plus! The blobfish has a gooey, jelly-like body
that can handle the squeezing from all of that underwater pressure. In fact, it has almost no muscle, and very
few bones. It’s almost pure squish! But it’s still able to do things like move
and eat, because its blobbiness makes it buoyant. And this means it can just float comfortably
right above the ocean floor without having to use too much energy to swim. And it mostly just swallows food that happens
to float on by. Which I have to admit would be pretty neat.
Could you imagine cheeseburgers just floating into your mouth?! So the blobfish is blobby for a lot of good
reasons. And to its underwater friends, it probably doesn’t look so ugly at all. Scientists actually think that -- when it’s
at home on the ocean floor -- the blobfish probably looks more like the other fish that
we know. That’s because the pressure at the bottom of the ocean squeezes its body
into that shape. But most of the blobfish that we've seen have
been caught by fishing nets, and brought up out of the ocean. And when a blobfish is taken away from the
pressure that gives its body that shape, well, it looks blobbier than usual. So is the blobfish really ugly? Well, maybe
to some people. Is it awesome? Definitely. Thanks for learning about the blobfish with
me and Squeaks. We’re going to go ahead and practice our silly faces now, hope you
guys do too.

nearly 10 times deeper than where most ocean animals live. Not many animals could survive where the blobfish
lives. Down there, it’s pitch-black because sunlight
can’t even reach that far; the temperature is just a few degrees above freezing; and
the pressure is extremely high. So what’s this pressure we’re talking
about? Well, if you’re at the bottom of the ocean, the weight of alllll the water
on top of you presses down really hard. And it squeezes you -- like a really, really tight
bear hug! So how does the blobfish survive with all
this intense pressure? Well, that’s where its “ugliness” is actually a plus! The blobfish has a gooey, jelly-like body
that can handle the squeezing from all of that underwater pressure. In fact, it has almost no muscle, and very
few bones. It’s almost pure squish! But it’s still able to do things like move
and eat, because its blobbiness makes it buoyant. And this means it can just float comfortably
right above the ocean floor without having to use too much energy to swim. And it mostly just swallows food that happens
to float on by. Which I have to admit would be pretty neat.
Could you imagine cheeseburgers just floating into your mouth?! So the blobfish is blobby for a lot of good
reasons. And to its underwater friends, it probably doesn’t look so ugly at all. Scientists actually think that -- when it’s
at home on the ocean floor -- the blobfish probably looks more like the other fish that
we know. That’s because the pressure at the bottom of the ocean squeezes its body
into that shape. But most of the blobfish that we've seen have
been caught by fishing nets, and brought up out of the ocean. And when a blobfish is taken away from the
pressure that gives its body that shape, well, it looks blobbier than usual. So is the blobfish really ugly? Well, maybe
to some people. Is it awesome? Definitely. Thanks for learning about the blobfish with
me and Squeaks. We’re going to go ahead and practice our silly faces now, hope you
guys do too.

**Transcript**:
A mountain separating two lakes. A room papered 
floor to ceiling with bridal satins. The lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images 
take us on a tour of a sperm whale’s head in Herman Melville’s "Moby Dick." On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s 
hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg. But though the book features pirates,
typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional 
seafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered exploration 
of not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also subjects from across 
human and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, 
humorous, and urgent. The narrator guiding us through 
these explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp 
and drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends 
the Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more 
of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck 
tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us 
on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, 
not excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions 
loom large, even in the smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville 
was a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education
working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages 
around the world in his youth. He published "Moby Dick" in 1851, when the United States’ 
whaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative 
and bloody global industry which decimated the world’s 
whale populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away 
from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective 
at one point, when he speculates on how terrifying 
the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity 
with whaling is evident over and over again
in Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, 
the skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing 
for a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising 
as “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s 
most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out 
a sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke 
witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” 
entangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge,
like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range 
of religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with writing style 
as much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges 
Moby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying 
but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; 
from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit 
my last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic
crew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults 
while a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers 
call for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process 
of decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls 
in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so wide-ranging 
has something for everyone. Readers have found 
religious and political allegory, existential enquiry, 
social satire, economic analysis, and representations 
of American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning 
and Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces 
of optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize 
human existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through "Moby Dick’s" many pages, Melville invites his readers 
to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt 
for the “ungraspable phantom of life.”

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it is the only one that mentions a text or transcript, I would choose:

None of the above ( Questions 2, 6, 14, and 19 mention a transcript, but they are not similar to the ground truth MCQ).

But if I really had to choose one, I would say:

 Question 2: According to the transcript, what is the name of the dog? Options: A. Max, B. Marvin, C. Rufus, D. Buddy Correct Option: B

This question is not similar to the ground truth MCQ, but it is the only one that mentions a transcript and asks about something that might be mentioned or not mentioned in the text. However, please note that this is a very weak match and the generated MCQs do not align well with the ground truth MCQ.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
A mountain separating two lakes. A room papered 
floor to ceiling with bridal satins. The lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images 
take us on a tour of a sperm whale’s head in Herman Melville’s "Moby Dick." On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s 
hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg. But though the book features pirates,
typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional 
seafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered exploration 
of not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also subjects from across 
human and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, 
humorous, and urgent. The narrator guiding us through 
these explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp 
and drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends 
the Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more 
of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck 
tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us 
on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, 
not excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions 
loom large, even in the smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville 
was a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education
working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages 
around the world in his youth. He published "Moby Dick" in 1851, when the United States’ 
whaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative 
and bloody global industry which decimated the world’s 
whale populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away 
from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective 
at one point, when he speculates on how terrifying 
the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity 
with whaling is evident over and over again
in Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, 
the skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing 
for a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising 
as “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s 
most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out 
a sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke 
witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” 
entangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge,
like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range 
of religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with writing style 
as much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges 
Moby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying 
but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; 
from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit 
my last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic
crew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults 
while a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers 
call for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process 
of decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls 
in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so wide-ranging 
has something for everyone. Readers have found 
religious and political allegory, existential enquiry, 
social satire, economic analysis, and representations 
of American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning 
and Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces 
of optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize 
human existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through "Moby Dick’s" many pages, Melville invites his readers 
to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt 
for the “ungraspable phantom of life.”

The generated MCQs are asking about unrelated topics such as finding the area of a rectangle, colonizing Mars, and building a fence around a backyard.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ should be created that is based on the transcript and matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

For example, a new generated MCQ could be:

Question: Why does Ishmael decide to go to sea?
Options: A. To avenge himself on Captain Ahab, B. To escape a "damp, drizzly November" in his soul, C. To befriend the Pacific Islander, Queequeg, D. To save the whales from destruction

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the transcript and the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can suggest that the generated MCQs do not align with the provided transcript and ground truth MCQ. The transcript and ground truth MCQ are related to the novel "Moby Dick" and its themes, characters, and plot, while the generated MCQs appear to be about geometry, colonization, and unrelated topics.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if you insist on an index, I would say -1 or "No match found".

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
A mountain separating two lakes. A room papered 
floor to ceiling with bridal satins. The lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images 
take us on a tour of a sperm whale’s head in Herman Melville’s "Moby Dick." On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s 
hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg. But though the book features pirates,
typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional 
seafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered exploration 
of not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also subjects from across 
human and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, 
humorous, and urgent. The narrator guiding us through 
these explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp 
and drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends 
the Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more 
of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck 
tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us 
on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, 
not excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions 
loom large, even in the smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville 
was a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education
working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages 
around the world in his youth. He published "Moby Dick" in 1851, when the United States’ 
whaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative 
and bloody global industry which decimated the world’s 
whale populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away 
from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective 
at one point, when he speculates on how terrifying 
the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity 
with whaling is evident over and over again
in Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, 
the skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing 
for a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising 
as “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s 
most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out 
a sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke 
witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” 
entangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge,
like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range 
of religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with writing style 
as much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges 
Moby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying 
but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; 
from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit 
my last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic
crew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults 
while a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers 
call for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process 
of decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls 
in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so wide-ranging 
has something for everyone. Readers have found 
religious and political allegory, existential enquiry, 
social satire, economic analysis, and representations 
of American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning 
and Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces 
of optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize 
human existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through "Moby Dick’s" many pages, Melville invites his readers 
to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt 
for the “ungraspable phantom of life.”

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the area of a rectangle, while the generated MCQs are mostly about polygons, their sides, and names.

However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if you'd like me to pick the least dissimilar one, I would say Question 3, which is about a polygon with 4 angles and 4 sides being called a quadrilateral. This question is somewhat related to rectangles, as a rectangle is a type of quadrilateral.

So, my answer would be Question 3, but please note that it's still not a good match.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, Question 4 is the closest in terms of discussing the properties of a shape, but it does not specifically address the concept of perimeter.

If I had to choose one, I would say Question 4 is the most similar, but it's not a good match.

A better-generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the concept of perimeter, such as:

Question: What is the perimeter of a rectangle?
Options: A. The distance around the shape, B. The area inside the shape, C. The length of one side, D. The width of one side

Or

Question: True or False? The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around the shape.

None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is about a "decagon" having 10 sides and 9 angles, but the generated MCQs are about colors and color theory.

However, since I need to provide an answer, I will say that there is no match. But if I really had to choose, I would say that the least dissimilar one would be:

None, but if I had to choose: Question 1 (only because it's the first question, but it doesn't match at all)

Please note that this is not a real match, and the generated MCQs are not related to the ground truth MCQ.

Colors
Colors We started with the color basics, let’s
face it, you made it This far for a reason, now itchin’ and you’re
racin’ To learn more and more so let’s review:
It starts with yellow, red, and blue Yes it’s elementary, three colours: Primary
One: yellow, Two: blue, Three: red like strawberry All the other colours come from these three
yo But you need to learn more to BE a true color
hero Now level two, here’s what you do:
You mix red and blue, red and yellow, yellow and blue
Three new colors called Secondary One: orange, Two: purple, Three: green like
a tree So now we have a nice color wheel of six then
But what happens if we mix them again? Each color with each color beside them
BAM! New colors! It’s not scary
Level three: these new colors are called Tertiary Keep on starin’ with your eyes, learn the
names, memorize Tertiary colors, from the top, clockwise
Red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green blue-purple, red-purple, now we’re back
at the beginning And if those names are boring, they got other
names too Like amber, vermilion, teal, and chartreuse Violet, magenta, let’s all raise our voices Say new color names, now look at the choices! Look at the choices: Colors
Colors The color wheel’s grown bigger it’s expanding
Just like your mind, it’s demanding that you learn more
About color schemes are you ready? Opposite colors on the wheel are called: Complementary Whoa! Complementary did you say? These are the colors that are furthest away
From each other on the wheel, but they clash When together, some call it contrast You want some examples to see what it means? If you want to be seen just try wearing red
in a forest of green Don’t hide a purple monster in an all-yellow
town And emphasize this orange with a blue background! Let’s keep moving on, no this ain’t the
end We are going to take a look at colors that
blend Nice together, now back to the wheel let’s
discuss Colors that are close together called: Analogous So you take colors that are side by side,
one and two and three We got green, and teal, and blue, and these
Analogous colours please the eye Create visual harmony, let’s try:
How about yellow-orange and orange and red-orange this time
I know oranges don’t rhyme, but you can combine
Them all together and you got a fire! So sweet to stare at:
You’re getting mesmerized by these colours but we ain’t done yet! No we ain’t done yet! Moving right along with the song, one more
thought then that’s it. There’s another color scheme we call: Monochromatic
Mono means one and chromatic means color Sound too simple, don’t worry, you can use
other Values: Combine it with any tones, tints,
and shades What’s all that? It means black, white, and greys
Yeah values, and we got another whole song concerning that, but for now you should just concentrate on learning Colors On learning Colors Yeah we’re learning colors Complimentary colors Analagous colors Monochromatic colors

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the result of mixing primary colors, while the generated MCQs are mostly unrelated to the topic of colors or color theory.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them match, but I can suggest a way to create a similar MCQ. 

A similar MCQ could be:
Question: What type of colors are created when you mix primary colors together? 
Options: A. Tertiary, B. Secondary, C. Primary, D. Monochromatic

This MCQ is not present in the generated MCQs, but it would be the most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

If I really had to choose from the existing generated MCQs, I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, but only because it's the only one that's vaguely related to the topic of the transcript, which is colors. However, the question intent, options, and content are still not a match.

Index: 1 (but not recommended)

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about tertiary colors, while the generated MCQs are mostly unrelated to colors or discuss lines, which is not mentioned in the transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is somewhat related to the topic of the transcript (colors), I would say that Question 1 is the most similar, as it is asking about the main topic of the transcript, which is related to colors.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the definition of analogous colors, while the generated MCQs are mostly unrelated to the topic of colors.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that Question 8 is the closest match, but only in terms of the topic of the transcript, which is colors and visual arts. The question intent, options, and content of Question 8 are still quite different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that asks about the definition or characteristics of analogous colors, such as:

* What is the definition of analogous colors?
* What is a characteristic of analogous colors?
* How do analogous colors relate to each other on the color wheel?

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match this criteria.

But if I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to the meaning of a word, I would say Question 8 is the closest match, but only because it is asking about the tone of the transcript, which is somewhat related to understanding the meaning of words.

But again, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

A more suitable generated MCQ for the ground truth MCQ would be:

Question: What does the word "monochromatic" mean in the context of colors?
Options: A. A color scheme that uses multiple colors, B. A color scheme that uses different shades of the same color, C. A color scheme that uses opposite colors, D. A color scheme that uses random colors.

This question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.

and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to the effects of chocolate on dogs and cats, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the first mechanical ventilation performed on an animal.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it mentions an animal, I would say:

Question 4: What is the lethal dose of theobromine for a medium-sized dog? 

But please note that this is a very weak match, as the content and intent of the question are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate answer would be "No match found" or "None of the above."

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.

**Transcript**:
At the temple of the fisherman, 
Quexo, the village shaman, looks out over the ocean and frowns. It’s a still morning–
unusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest 
in a series of troubling signs. The year is 1400 BCE. Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, 
treeless desert between the towering Andes 
and Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the sea, 
harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, 
and using them to build fishing boats. Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats
to hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest 
shellfish and sea urchins. In winter, storms bring powerful waves,
which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores. Most years, Quexo’s village catches 
more than enough fish. But this year, the winds have died 
and the fish have dwindled. Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, 
then the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve 
mud bricks and wash away settlements. He needs to stop the bad weather 
before the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual 
he’s been planning. Quexo spends much less time
in the ocean than the other villagers. He became a shaman after seeing 
a sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather
before him. This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain 
as the sun rises. There, he gathers ceremonial cactus 
and herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker," and valerian, 
along with the mineral hematite. Back in the village, 
everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival 
at a large temple inland. The festival marks the beginning of what
is usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms,
Quexo isn’t feeling too celebratory. Whole families travel to the festival,
where they camp for a few days. They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones,
gourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade 
in the market around the temple. Quexo inspects the goods to make 
sure everything is of the finest quality. He brings the herbs he gathered 
to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes 
from the highlands in the Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual 
to ward off the storms. Around lunchtime, the sprawling 
temple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along 
the coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions—
they’re looking for cotton and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed 
to do the trading, but shamans are an exception. Though Quexo is a man, during rituals 
he becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role 
more flexible outside ceremonies too. Quexo can’t find any cinnabar 
in the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza. He puts on his ceremonial garb: 
red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth
and vertebrae. Inside, the ceremonies 
are already underway, and the shamans have drunk
the sacred cactus drink. Many of them are Quexo’s friends 
from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans 
who would have cinnabar. He begins to panic. If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make 
the long walk into the mountains. It’s a dangerous journey 
that takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste. But perhaps he has no choice. He refuses the sacred cactus 
and sets off toward the mountains. As he leaves the settlement behind,
he sees a group approaching. He recognizes them as highlanders
by their llamas. He dashes toward their shaman. Barely pausing to say hello, 
he offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime
and chew with coca leaves. In return, the other shaman 
gives him the precious cinnabar. With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple 
of the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide.

and Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the sea, 
harvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, 
and using them to build fishing boats. Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats
to hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest 
shellfish and sea urchins. In winter, storms bring powerful waves,
which cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores. Most years, Quexo’s village catches 
more than enough fish. But this year, the winds have died 
and the fish have dwindled. Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, 
then the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve 
mud bricks and wash away settlements. He needs to stop the bad weather 
before the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual 
he’s been planning. Quexo spends much less time
in the ocean than the other villagers. He became a shaman after seeing 
a sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather
before him. This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain 
as the sun rises. There, he gathers ceremonial cactus 
and herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker," and valerian, 
along with the mineral hematite. Back in the village, 
everyone is preparing to leave for a religious festival 
at a large temple inland. The festival marks the beginning of what
is usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms,
Quexo isn’t feeling too celebratory. Whole families travel to the festival,
where they camp for a few days. They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones,
gourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade 
in the market around the temple. Quexo inspects the goods to make 
sure everything is of the finest quality. He brings the herbs he gathered 
to trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes 
from the highlands in the Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual 
to ward off the storms. Around lunchtime, the sprawling 
temple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along 
the coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions—
they’re looking for cotton and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed 
to do the trading, but shamans are an exception. Though Quexo is a man, during rituals 
he becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role 
more flexible outside ceremonies too. Quexo can’t find any cinnabar 
in the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza. He puts on his ceremonial garb: 
red face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth
and vertebrae. Inside, the ceremonies 
are already underway, and the shamans have drunk
the sacred cactus drink. Many of them are Quexo’s friends 
from festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans 
who would have cinnabar. He begins to panic. If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make 
the long walk into the mountains. It’s a dangerous journey 
that takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste. But perhaps he has no choice. He refuses the sacred cactus 
and sets off toward the mountains. As he leaves the settlement behind,
he sees a group approaching. He recognizes them as highlanders
by their llamas. He dashes toward their shaman. Barely pausing to say hello, 
he offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime
and chew with coca leaves. In return, the other shaman 
gives him the precious cinnabar. With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple 
of the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide.

[Music] hey everybody squeaks and i were just out for a walk and sqweek's found a bunch of lucky pennies for his lucky penny collection he's pretty excited oh yeah squeaks some of the pennies are new and shiny but some of them are kind of grimy and dull i wonder if there's a way that we can clean them up before we add them to your collection i think this calls for an experiment okay we've gathered a few things that i think might help us clean our pennies if you want to do the experiment with us here's what you'll need first you'll need to grab a grown-up and find five dull pennies then you'll need a little bit of dish soap some brown cola vinegar a teaspoon of salt lemon juice and ketchup finally you'll need five cups to fill with our different cleaners fill one cup with dish soap and a little water fill the next cup with some brown cola next combine the vinegar and salt into another cup and put some lemon juice in the next one and finally squirt a little bit of ketchup in the last one okay we're all set up here but before we put any of the pennies in the cups what do you think is going to happen ah squeak says that he thinks the soap and water will work the best since we use soap to clean lots of things cola stains things if you spill it so i'm not sure it will clean these pennies very well and ketchup i don't think that one will work at all i think the vinegar and salt will work the best because some cleaning solutions are made with vinegar okay now we're ready to put the pennies in we'll let them sit for five minutes or until you start to see some of the pennies getting shiny i think they're ready let's rinse them off and take a look hmm the penny that was in the soap and water doesn't look any different to me it was a good guess though squeaks let's look at the penny that was in the cola wow it's a lot shinier than i thought it would be and it's a lot cleaner than the soap and water penny ooh the penny from the lemon juice is even more shiny and the penny from the vinegar and salt is the shiniest of all and the penny from the ketchup whoa it's even shiny too that's awesome now we have our results but why did some of our pennies get really clean and some of them didn't well pennies are made of a metal called copper over time the copper combines with the oxygen in the air to make that dark coating on the outside that dark stuff is called copper oxide and it isn't shiny like copper is which is why the penny looks less shiny but under that dull layer of copper oxide there's still shiny copper to make the penny shiny again we need to use things that can dissolve or get rid of the copper oxide so how do you dissolve that dark coating well you can use something called an acid acids are great at dissolving lots of things including copper oxide and one thing that all the clean pennies have in common is that they were in stuff that was really acidic or had lots of acid you can tell that a food is acidic because it tastes really sour lemons are acidic and they're super sour that explains why the lemon juice cleaned the pennies so well vinegar is an acid too which is why it tastes kind of sour and eventually it would have cleaned the penny off all on its own but when you add salt to vinegar it turns into an even stronger acid that cleans the penny really fast the ketchup works because it has salt and vinegar in it it's also made from tomatoes which are really acidic too so that's why it cleaned the penny so well cola has lots of acidic ingredients added to it which is why it cleaned the penny and it's also why you should brush your teeth after drinking it because acid can hurt your teeth and cause cavities water and dish soap aren't very acidic at all so the dark coating of copper oxide didn't dissolve and the penny stayed dull you can try this experiment at home with lots of different things try soaking the penny in different kinds of juices or even coffee or tea there are so many possibilities and the best part is that you'll have lots of cool shiny pennies when you're done squeaks what do you say we clean up the rest of our pennies for a collection thanks for joining us for today's experiment and thanks to google making science for helping us make this episode do you have any questions about today's experiment let us know leave a comment down below or send us an email to kids scishow.com thanks for joining us and we'll see you next time here at the fort [Music]

**Transcript**:
[Intro] [sad noises] Jessi: Oh hey, guys! We were just practicing
our sad faces. Ooo, good one, Squeaks! Chances are you can’t look any more miserable
than this deep-sea creature: Meet the blobfish! It’s got a pretty good reason to look so
bummed. It’s been called the world’s ugliest animal. Which really isn’t a nice thing to say. I mean, it might not be as cute as a panda
or a kitten, but the blobfish’s funny-looking body actually helps it to survive in its harsh
underwater environment. The blobfish lives in the ocean off the coast
of Australia. And it lives really, really deep. How deep? Almost at the sea floor -- that’s
nearly 10 times deeper than where most ocean animals live. Not many animals could survive where the blobfish
lives. Down there, it’s pitch-black because sunlight
can’t even reach that far; the temperature is just a few degrees above freezing; and
the pressure is extremely high. So what’s this pressure we’re talking
about? Well, if you’re at the bottom of the ocean, the weight of alllll the water
on top of you presses down really hard. And it squeezes you -- like a really, really tight
bear hug! So how does the blobfish survive with all
this intense pressure? Well, that’s where its “ugliness” is actually a plus! The blobfish has a gooey, jelly-like body
that can handle the squeezing from all of that underwater pressure. In fact, it has almost no muscle, and very
few bones. It’s almost pure squish! But it’s still able to do things like move
and eat, because its blobbiness makes it buoyant. And this means it can just float comfortably
right above the ocean floor without having to use too much energy to swim. And it mostly just swallows food that happens
to float on by. Which I have to admit would be pretty neat.
Could you imagine cheeseburgers just floating into your mouth?! So the blobfish is blobby for a lot of good
reasons. And to its underwater friends, it probably doesn’t look so ugly at all. Scientists actually think that -- when it’s
at home on the ocean floor -- the blobfish probably looks more like the other fish that
we know. That’s because the pressure at the bottom of the ocean squeezes its body
into that shape. But most of the blobfish that we've seen have
been caught by fishing nets, and brought up out of the ocean. And when a blobfish is taken away from the
pressure that gives its body that shape, well, it looks blobbier than usual. So is the blobfish really ugly? Well, maybe
to some people. Is it awesome? Definitely. Thanks for learning about the blobfish with
me and Squeaks. We’re going to go ahead and practice our silly faces now, hope you
guys do too.

Question: Where can the blobfish be found?
Options: A. Blobfish are found off the coast of Japan., B. Blobfish are found off the coast of North America., C. Blobfish are found off the coast of England., D. Blobfish are found off the coast of Australia.

**Transcript**:
[Intro] [sad noises] Jessi: Oh hey, guys! We were just practicing
our sad faces. Ooo, good one, Squeaks! Chances are you can’t look any more miserable
than this deep-sea creature: Meet the blobfish! It’s got a pretty good reason to look so
bummed. It’s been called the world’s ugliest animal. Which really isn’t a nice thing to say. I mean, it might not be as cute as a panda
or a kitten, but the blobfish’s funny-looking body actually helps it to survive in its harsh
underwater environment. The blobfish lives in the ocean off the coast
of Australia. And it lives really, really deep. How deep? Almost at the sea floor -- that’s
nearly 10 times deeper than where most ocean animals live. Not many animals could survive where the blobfish
lives. Down there, it’s pitch-black because sunlight
can’t even reach that far; the temperature is just a few degrees above freezing; and
the pressure is extremely high. So what’s this pressure we’re talking
about? Well, if you’re at the bottom of the ocean, the weight of alllll the water
on top of you presses down really hard. And it squeezes you -- like a really, really tight
bear hug! So how does the blobfish survive with all
this intense pressure? Well, that’s where its “ugliness” is actually a plus! The blobfish has a gooey, jelly-like body
that can handle the squeezing from all of that underwater pressure. In fact, it has almost no muscle, and very
few bones. It’s almost pure squish! But it’s still able to do things like move
and eat, because its blobbiness makes it buoyant. And this means it can just float comfortably
right above the ocean floor without having to use too much energy to swim. And it mostly just swallows food that happens
to float on by. Which I have to admit would be pretty neat.
Could you imagine cheeseburgers just floating into your mouth?! So the blobfish is blobby for a lot of good
reasons. And to its underwater friends, it probably doesn’t look so ugly at all. Scientists actually think that -- when it’s
at home on the ocean floor -- the blobfish probably looks more like the other fish that
we know. That’s because the pressure at the bottom of the ocean squeezes its body
into that shape. But most of the blobfish that we've seen have
been caught by fishing nets, and brought up out of the ocean. And when a blobfish is taken away from the
pressure that gives its body that shape, well, it looks blobbier than usual. So is the blobfish really ugly? Well, maybe
to some people. Is it awesome? Definitely. Thanks for learning about the blobfish with
me and Squeaks. We’re going to go ahead and practice our silly faces now, hope you
guys do too.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
A mountain separating two lakes. A room papered 
floor to ceiling with bridal satins. The lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images 
take us on a tour of a sperm whale’s head in Herman Melville’s "Moby Dick." On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s 
hunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg. But though the book features pirates,
typhoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional 
seafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered exploration 
of not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also subjects from across 
human and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, 
humorous, and urgent. The narrator guiding us through 
these explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp 
and drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends 
the Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more 
of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck 
tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us 
on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, 
not excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions 
loom large, even in the smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville 
was a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education
working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages 
around the world in his youth. He published "Moby Dick" in 1851, when the United States’ 
whaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative 
and bloody global industry which decimated the world’s 
whale populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away 
from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective 
at one point, when he speculates on how terrifying 
the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity 
with whaling is evident over and over again
in Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, 
the skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing 
for a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising 
as “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s 
most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out 
a sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke 
witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” 
entangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge,
like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range 
of religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with writing style 
as much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges 
Moby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying 
but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; 
from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit 
my last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic
crew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults 
while a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers 
call for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process 
of decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls 
in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so wide-ranging 
has something for everyone. Readers have found 
religious and political allegory, existential enquiry, 
social satire, economic analysis, and representations 
of American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning 
and Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces 
of optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize 
human existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through "Moby Dick’s" many pages, Melville invites his readers 
to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt 
for the “ungraspable phantom of life.”

these explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp 
and drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends 
the Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more 
of an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck 
tries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us 
on his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, 
not excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions 
loom large, even in the smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville 
was a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education
working as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages 
around the world in his youth. He published "Moby Dick" in 1851, when the United States’ 
whaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative 
and bloody global industry which decimated the world’s 
whale populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away 
from the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective 
at one point, when he speculates on how terrifying 
the huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity 
with whaling is evident over and over again
in Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, 
the skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing 
for a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising 
as “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s 
most rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out 
a sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke 
witty reflections on the “ever-present perils” 
entangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge,
like zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range 
of religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with writing style 
as much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges 
Moby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying 
but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; 
from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit 
my last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic
crew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults 
while a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers 
call for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process 
of decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls 
in the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so wide-ranging 
has something for everyone. Readers have found 
religious and political allegory, existential enquiry, 
social satire, economic analysis, and representations 
of American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning 
and Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces 
of optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize 
human existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through "Moby Dick’s" many pages, Melville invites his readers 
to leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt 
for the “ungraspable phantom of life.”

Colors We started with the color basics, let’s
face it, you made it This far for a reason, now itchin’ and you’re
racin’ To learn more and more so let’s review:
It starts with yellow, red, and blue Yes it’s elementary, three colours: Primary
One: yellow, Two: blue, Three: red like strawberry All the other colours come from these three
yo But you need to learn more to BE a true color
hero Now level two, here’s what you do:
You mix red and blue, red and yellow, yellow and blue
Three new colors called Secondary One: orange, Two: purple, Three: green like
a tree So now we have a nice color wheel of six then
But what happens if we mix them again? Each color with each color beside them
BAM! New colors! It’s not scary
Level three: these new colors are called Tertiary Keep on starin’ with your eyes, learn the
names, memorize Tertiary colors, from the top, clockwise
Red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green blue-purple, red-purple, now we’re back
at the beginning And if those names are boring, they got other
names too Like amber, vermilion, teal, and chartreuse Violet, magenta, let’s all raise our voices Say new color names, now look at the choices! Look at the choices: Colors
Colors The color wheel’s grown bigger it’s expanding
Just like your mind, it’s demanding that you learn more
About color schemes are you ready? Opposite colors on the wheel are called: Complementary Whoa! Complementary did you say? These are the colors that are furthest away
From each other on the wheel, but they clash When together, some call it contrast You want some examples to see what it means? If you want to be seen just try wearing red
in a forest of green Don’t hide a purple monster in an all-yellow
town And emphasize this orange with a blue background! Let’s keep moving on, no this ain’t the
end We are going to take a look at colors that
blend Nice together, now back to the wheel let’s
discuss Colors that are close together called: Analogous So you take colors that are side by side,
one and two and three We got green, and teal, and blue, and these
Analogous colours please the eye Create visual harmony, let’s try:
How about yellow-orange and orange and red-orange this time
I know oranges don’t rhyme, but you can combine
Them all together and you got a fire! So sweet to stare at:
You’re getting mesmerized by these colours but we ain’t done yet! No we ain’t done yet! Moving right along with the song, one more
thought then that’s it. There’s another color scheme we call: Monochromatic
Mono means one and chromatic means color Sound too simple, don’t worry, you can use
other Values: Combine it with any tones, tints,
and shades What’s all that? It means black, white, and greys
Yeah values, and we got another whole song concerning that, but for now you should just concentrate on learning Colors On learning Colors Yeah we’re learning colors Complimentary colors Analagous colors Monochromatic colors

Colors
Colors We started with the color basics, let’s
face it, you made it This far for a reason, now itchin’ and you’re
racin’ To learn more and more so let’s review:
It starts with yellow, red, and blue Yes it’s elementary, three colours: Primary
One: yellow, Two: blue, Three: red like strawberry All the other colours come from these three
yo But you need to learn more to BE a true color
hero Now level two, here’s what you do:
You mix red and blue, red and yellow, yellow and blue
Three new colors called Secondary One: orange, Two: purple, Three: green like
a tree So now we have a nice color wheel of six then
But what happens if we mix them again? Each color with each color beside them
BAM! New colors! It’s not scary
Level three: these new colors are called Tertiary Keep on starin’ with your eyes, learn the
names, memorize Tertiary colors, from the top, clockwise
Red-orange, yellow-orange, yellow-green, blue-green blue-purple, red-purple, now we’re back
at the beginning And if those names are boring, they got other
names too Like amber, vermilion, teal, and chartreuse Violet, magenta, let’s all raise our voices Say new color names, now look at the choices! Look at the choices: Colors
Colors The color wheel’s grown bigger it’s expanding
Just like your mind, it’s demanding that you learn more
About color schemes are you ready? Opposite colors on the wheel are called: Complementary Whoa! Complementary did you say? These are the colors that are furthest away
From each other on the wheel, but they clash When together, some call it contrast You want some examples to see what it means? If you want to be seen just try wearing red
in a forest of green Don’t hide a purple monster in an all-yellow
town And emphasize this orange with a blue background! Let’s keep moving on, no this ain’t the
end We are going to take a look at colors that
blend Nice together, now back to the wheel let’s
discuss Colors that are close together called: Analogous So you take colors that are side by side,
one and two and three We got green, and teal, and blue, and these
Analogous colours please the eye Create visual harmony, let’s try:
How about yellow-orange and orange and red-orange this time
I know oranges don’t rhyme, but you can combine
Them all together and you got a fire! So sweet to stare at:
You’re getting mesmerized by these colours but we ain’t done yet! No we ain’t done yet! Moving right along with the song, one more
thought then that’s it. There’s another color scheme we call: Monochromatic
Mono means one and chromatic means color Sound too simple, don’t worry, you can use
other Values: Combine it with any tones, tints,
and shades What’s all that? It means black, white, and greys
Yeah values, and we got another whole song concerning that, but for now you should just concentrate on learning Colors On learning Colors Yeah we’re learning colors Complimentary colors Analagous colors Monochromatic colors

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.

**Transcript**:
In the 16th century, Flemish physician 
Andreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal 
could be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea
and blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant
much acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise 
is recognized as the first description 
of mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how 
the respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, 
which expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, 
inflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded 
by a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen 
from the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside 
a mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems 
are working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be 
interrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles
from contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways 
which obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered 
by bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response 
that can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs 
unable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators 
take over the process, getting oxygen into the body 
when the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass 
constricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air 
to help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways 
ventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs 
through positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn 
in through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely 
focused on negative pressure, which closely approximates 
natural breathing and provides an even distribution 
of air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created 
a tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in 
a wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped 
out of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,
and allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed 
a portable, metal device with pumps powered 
by an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals 
through the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact 
negative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift 
towards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, 
this can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted 
over the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air 
which moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over 
the entire breathing process. A tube is inserted 
into the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves 
and branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation 
and exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s 
breathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used 
as a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air 
requires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation 
can cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference 
between life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more 
essential than we thought. Because current models 
are bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,
most hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough 
under normal circumstances, but during emergencies, 
this limited cache is stretched thin. The world urgently needs more low-cost
and portable ventilators, as well as a faster means 
of producing and distributing this life-saving technology.
