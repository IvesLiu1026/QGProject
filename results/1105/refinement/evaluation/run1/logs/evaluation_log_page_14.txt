Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is focused on the phonetic combination that does NOT create the long "i" sound, whereas the generated MCQs are more focused on the themes, characters, and tone of the transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the overall theme of language and phonetics, I would choose Question 5: "What is the significance of the 'Magic E' in the transcript?" This question is related to the concept of phonetic combinations and the role of the "Magic E" in creating certain sounds, which is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5

Please note that this is a weak match, and the generated MCQs do not directly address the specific question about phonetic combinations and the long "i" sound.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. The ground truth MCQ is focused on identifying the letter pair that makes the long "e" sound, whereas the generated MCQs are focused on themes, characters, and messages in the transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the context of the transcript, I would choose Question 5: "What is the significance of the 'Magic E' in the transcript?" This question is related to the concept of the "Magic E" which is mentioned in the transcript, and it could be inferred that the "Magic E" is related to the letter pair that makes the long "e" sound.

But, since the question content, options, and overall intent of Question 5 do not directly match the ground truth MCQ, I must emphasize that this is a weak match.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is:

**Question 7: What is the narrator's attitude towards trying new things in the line "can't I be more like you I I I I just don't know what to do you all know what to say but I'm much too shy to even try"?**

Although the question content is not an exact match, the intent and options are related to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ asks about the word where the letter "y" makes the long "i" sound, and one of the options is "try". The generated MCQ 7 is about the narrator's attitude towards trying new things, which is related to the concept of "try" in the ground truth MCQ.

However, a closer look at the generated MCQs reveals that **Question 8** is actually more relevant to the ground truth MCQ. Question 8 mentions the phrase "all you have to do is try" which is more closely related to the concept of the letter "y" making the long "i" sound in the word "try".

Therefore, I would recommend:

**Question 8** as the most similar generated MCQ.

Index: 8

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1905, psychologists 
Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children 
who were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children
required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is:

**Question 9: What was the result of the military's use of IQ tests during WWI, in terms of its influence on eugenics? Options: A. The creation of policies promoting equal education for all, B. The forced sterilization of people with low IQ, C. The use of IQ test results to make erroneous claims about racial groups, D. The reduction of funding for education Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more similar question would be one that specifically asks about the purpose of the US military's use of IQ tests during WWI.

A more suitable match would be:

**Question 3 is not a match, but if we look at the other questions, Question 9 is the closest match. However, there is no perfect match.**

However, I must note that there is no perfect match among the generated MCQs for the given ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose the closest match, I would say it is **Question 9**.

However, I can try to explain why I chose it:

The ground truth MCQ asks about the purpose of the US military's use of IQ tests during WWI. Question 9 asks about the result of the military's use of IQ tests during WWI, in terms of its influence on eugenics. While the questions are not identical, they both relate to the military's use of IQ tests during WWI.

If I had to choose a question index, I would say **9**.

However, please note that this is not a perfect match.

It would be more accurate to say that there is no perfect match among the generated MCQs for the given ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an index, I would say **9**.

**Transcript**:
In 1905, psychologists 
Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children 
who were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children
required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What was the result of the military's use of IQ tests during WWI, in terms of its influence on eugenics?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is the closest in terms of content and intent. Both questions relate to the misuse of IQ tests in the past, specifically during the 1920s and WWI. However, the ground truth MCQ asks about an inaccurate statement regarding IQ tests, whereas Question 9 asks about the result of the military's use of IQ tests.

A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that asks about an inaccurate statement regarding IQ tests, but such a question is not present among the generated MCQs. Therefore, Question 9 is the closest match.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 6: According to the transcript, what is still sometimes used to diagnose learning disabilities? Options: A. A separate set of tests designed specifically for learning disabilities, B. A combination of IQ tests and clinical judgment, C. A subset of the tests used to determine IQ, D. None of the above Correct Option: C**

However, this question does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. A more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about an appropriate use of IQ tests, with options that include identifying intellectual disability.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose the closest one, I would choose:

**Question 3: What was the main purpose of the IQ test initially designed by Simon and Binet? Options: A. To sort people into different racial groups, B. To identify children who needed individualized attention, C. To measure general intelligence, D. To evaluate psychiatric conditions Correct Option: B**

This question is related to the appropriate use of IQ tests, but it does not specifically ask about the current use of IQ tests. Instead, it asks about the initial purpose of the IQ test designed by Simon and Binet.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is **Question 3**. However, I would like to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, and a more suitable match would be a generated MCQ that specifically asks about an appropriate use of IQ tests.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that the most similar generated MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can suggest a closest match.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the current states that represented the Northeast or New England Colonies. The closest match among the generated MCQs is not a direct match, but Question 7 mentions the New England colonies and their characteristics.

However, if I had to choose a question that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ, I would suggest Question 2, which asks about the primary reason for the settlement of the New England colonies. Although it does not ask about the specific states, it is related to the New England colonies.

If I had to provide an index, I would say that the closest match is not present, but a related question is Question 2.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided options. However, based on the content and intent of the ground truth MCQ, I can identify a generated MCQ that partially matches it.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the current states that made up the Middle Colonies. While there isn't a direct match among the generated MCQs, Question 3 mentions the Middle Colonies and their characteristics.

However, a more relevant question is Question 1, which asks about the region with a more mild climate, allowing for the growth of wheat and other grain crops. The correct option for this question is not the Middle Colonies' characteristic mentioned in the ground truth MCQ, but the question does mention the Middle Colonies as an option.

Considering the options provided, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match, but it's not a direct match.

If I had to choose an index, I would say: **1**

However, please note that this is not a direct match, and the generated MCQs do not explicitly ask about the current states that made up the Middle Colonies.

A more accurate match would be a generated MCQ that explicitly asks about the composition of the Middle Colonies, which is not present in the provided options.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the sound of the digraph "WH" being similar to a specific letter, whereas the generated MCQs are about the transcript's content, theme, and events.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the alphabet-related content, I would choose:

**Question 2: Which letter of the alphabet is the group trying to find?**

This question is still quite different from the ground truth MCQ, but it's the closest one in terms of alphabet-related content.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: **2**

Please note that this is a weak match, and the generated MCQs do not accurately represent the ground truth MCQ's intent and content.

After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the sound of the digraph "PH" being similar to the letter "F", whereas the generated MCQs are about the transcript's content, which is about collecting alphabet letters to make a tea party more enjoyable.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the alphabet theme, I would choose:

**None of the above**

But if I really had to choose one, I would say:

**Question 2**

This question is about identifying a specific letter in the alphabet, which is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ's focus on the sound of a specific letter combination. However, please note that this is a very loose connection, and the generated MCQs do not accurately match the ground truth MCQ's intent or content.

This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se "such as" and "for example" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century. The tilt increased to more than five degrees. The people feared it would collapse into ruins. Now we know the problem what's the solution? [Earth] was removed from under the monument and weights were added to balance out the top of it They directed the lean- at least a little bit that problem and solution not a riddle, kid. Just look out for the words involved. Since question question problem solution and solve. I got another text you don't have to ask and its text structure? Compare and contrast.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, Question 3 does not ask about the specific words that can be clues for the Description text structure. A more similar question would be one that asks about the specific words or phrases that indicate the use of a certain text structure.

Upon closer inspection, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. However, if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 3 is the closest, but it would need to be modified to ask about the specific words that indicate the Description text structure.

If I had to provide an index, I would say 3, but with the caveat that it's not a perfect match.

However, I can try to create a new question that matches the ground truth MCQ more closely:

New Question: What words or phrases can be clues that an author is using the text structure of Description?
Options: A. For example, such as, B. Because, since, problems, C. Next, then, before, D. Both, while, because

This new question is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made

of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation

requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people

more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 9. 

This question asks about the relationship between wealth and standards of living and altruism, which is related to the ground truth MCQ about changes in altruistic behaviors over time. The correct option for Question 9, "Wealth and standards of living are positively related to altruism," suggests that as societies become wealthier and better off, people seem to turn their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism towards strangers increases. This is consistent with the ground truth MCQ's correct option, "Altruistic behaviors are becoming more common." 

Although the questions are not identical, they both address the idea that altruism is increasing or becoming more common, whether it's over time or as a result of increased wealth and standards of living.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The ground truth MCQ is asking about the continent with "desert for miles." Based on the transcript, Africa is the continent that matches this description, with the line "I am Africa, with desert for miles and my Nile is the longest river."

Among the generated MCQs, none directly ask about the continent with "desert for miles." However, Question 2 mentions the Nile River, which is associated with Africa in the transcript. But Question 2 is asking about the name of the longest river in Africa, not the continent itself.

Considering the options and content, Question 5 is not a good match because it asks about a continent with a diverse range of animals and a long river, which could refer to Africa, but it's not the best match.

However, looking at the other questions, none of them directly match the ground truth MCQ. But among the generated MCQs, Question 2 is the closest to mentioning a characteristic unique to Africa (the Nile River), although it's not asking about the desert specifically.

But since the ground truth MCQ is asking which continent has "desert for miles" and among the generated MCQs, none of them ask this question, I will try to find a generated MCQ that has Africa as a correct option and has a geographical or environmental characteristic as its subject.

In this case, I will choose Question 3, which asks about the continent known for its vast rainforests and diverse wildlife. Although this is not a direct match, Question 3 has a geographical/environmental characteristic as its subject and has Africa as an option (although it's not the correct option).

However, I noticed that Question 5 has Africa as an option and also talks about geographical characteristics (rainforests and diverse wildlife, and a long river). 

Between Questions 3 and 5, I think Question 5 is more similar to the ground truth MCQ because it has Africa as an option and talks about geographical characteristics that could be related to Africa.

However, I must admit that this is a bit of a stretch since none of the generated MCQs directly ask about the continent with "desert for miles."

Therefore, the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: 5

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
To find the most similar generated MCQ, we need to analyze the content, options, and intent of the ground truth MCQ and compare it with the generated MCQs.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about the comparison of the size of South America and Africa. However, none of the generated MCQs directly compare the sizes of these two continents. 

But if we look at the generated MCQs, Question 1 is asking about the largest continent in terms of land area, and the options include Africa and Asia. Although it does not directly compare Africa and South America, it provides information about the relative sizes of the continents.

However, a more relevant question is Question 3, which asks about the continent known for its vast rainforests and diverse wildlife. The correct answer is South America, but this does not provide a direct comparison with Africa.

Another relevant question is Question 9, which asks about the continent that is home to more than half of the world's population, and the correct answer is Asia. However, Question 5 also provides some information about South America, stating that it has a diverse range of animals and a long river (though the song actually mentions the Nile as the longest river, which is in Africa).

Among the generated MCQs, none directly compares the sizes of South America and Africa. However, since Question 1 is about the largest continent in terms of land area and provides some information about the relative sizes of the continents, and given the lack of more relevant options, it is the most similar.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content, options, and overall intent. However, I can identify the generated MCQ that is most similar to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks which of the following is NOT a continent, with options including Africa, Atlantis, Antarctica, and Australia. The correct answer is Atlantis, which is a mythological place and not a real continent.

Among the generated MCQs, none of them ask about a non-existent continent. However, I can look for MCQs that ask about continent identification or classification.

The most similar generated MCQ is Question 6, which asks which continent is often considered part of the continent of Oceania in the traditional seven-continent model. Although this question does not ask about a non-existent continent, it does ask about continent classification, which is related to the ground truth MCQ.

However, another generated MCQ is more similar in terms of the options provided. Question 8 asks which continent is mentioned last in the song, with options including Asia, Africa, North America, and Australia. This question includes Australia as an option, which is also present in the ground truth MCQ.

But the most similar generated MCQ in terms of question intent is not present. However, Question 6 is the most similar in terms of the context of the continents being asked about in the options of the MCQ.

Therefore, I would recommend Question 6 as the most similar generated MCQ, but with a note that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 6

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about Leonardo DaVinci's professions, while the generated MCQs are about auditory illusions and perception.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs are not similar to the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say -1 (or None), as there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

However, I can help you create a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. Here is an example:

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.

to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took

to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a completely different topic, such as octopuses and their suckers.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to provide an index, I would say -1 or "None" as there is no generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

If you could provide more context or clarify what you are looking for, I would be happy to help further.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 17, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
This octopus is making a quick escape… with the help of its suckers. The suckers are incredibly strong. And while we only have two hands to grab things,
an octopus holds on with hundreds of suckers running up and down each arm. Suckers come in pretty handy to get around. Or to grab a bite to eat. Or to hang onto your keeper’s arm. So how do suckers stick so well? It’s not super glue. It’s water pressure. Each sucker has a ring called an infundibulum. It creates a water-tight seal. Inside the sucker there’s a chamber, like
a cup, called the acetabulum. It’s full of water. When the octopus expands the chamber, it lowers
the pressure inside. The higher pressure outside pushes against
the sucker creating a powerful grip. Suckers get such a workout that their skin
sloughs off every few weeks. See that ring-shaped piece of skin floating
by? It used to be the bottom of a sucker. Suckers have another super-power. They actually can smell and taste. That helps the octopus tell there’s no snail
inside this shell. Hundreds of suckers tasting and smelling,
and flexible arms moving every which way, create a huge amount of information -- a lot
for the octopus’ central brain to process. So each arm has a mind of its own. In fact, two thirds of an octopus’ neurons
are in its arms. That means the central brain isn’t really
calling all the shots. The central brain tells the arms how fast
to move. But the instructions on how to reach come
from each arm. It’s a nifty way to process all that information,
making the octopus the well-choreographed creature we know. AMY: Hi. This is Amy Standen. You may have noticed a different voice on

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, such as population growth, geography, and university projects, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the biology of octopuses, specifically the function of their suckers.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that a new set of generated MCQs be created that are relevant to the topic of the transcript, which is about the biology of octopuses.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that are relevant to the topic and then try to match them with the ground truth MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about the percentage of an octopus' neurons in its arms, while the generated MCQs are about unrelated topics such as population growth, geography, and university projects.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you insist on an answer, I would say that the generated MCQs are not relevant to the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say -1 (or Not Applicable) since there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
India and China, together, are home to over
2.7 billion people. That's as many humans as in the next 20 most
populous countries combined, or in the whole other 170 countries in the world. Over the last 300 years, India and China each
added more than a billion people to their populations, way more than any other country,
but they have actually been growing at about the same rate as the rest of the world. They have a lot more people today because
they had a lot more people a few hundred years ago, when the world began its period of modern,
and rapid, population growth. It's like comparing a big bank account and
a small one. If they both grow at about the same rate over
many years, the big one gains a lot more money, simply because it started with more. So the billion-dollar, er, billion-person
question, is why did India and China have so many people when they started their rapid
growth? We can’t know for sure, since so many variables
factor into long-term population dynamics, but the two most plausible explanations are
food and area. Having lots of fertile land and good access
to fresh water makes it possible to grow lots of food, which in turn makes it possible to
nourish a lot of people. Even today, the 10 most populated countries
in the world all have a relatively large amount of farmland. And Asia - and in particular south and east
Asia - has tons of farmland, lots of river valleys, and the ability to grow food year-round. Plus, domestication of plants and animals
essentially started in Asia, giving populations an early leg - or wing - up. As such, Asia’s been the most densely populated
region of the world for a really long time. Area matters too; countries like Pakistan
and Bangladesh may be filled with farms and densely-populated, but because they’re smaller
in area than India and China, they simply cannot contain as many people. Of course, a few other things happened in
India and China in the last few thousand years, and some of them helped the populations grow,
and some of them shrank the populations, but through it all, the large and fertile lands
of India and China were able to sustain lots of people, such that when the era of modern
population growth came around, they had a head start. Or rather, a hundred-million-head start. This video was sponsored by the University
of Minnesota, where students, faculty and staff across all fields of study are working
to solve the Grand Challenges facing society. The Minnesota Population Center is helping
demographic researchers explore past and current trends in world population, the Global Landscapes
Initiative is working to figure out how to keep feeding the world's growing population
without harming the planet, and the IPUMS Terra project integrates global population
data with data on the environment to better understand how humans transform ecosystems,
and how ecosystems transform humans. Thanks, University of Minnesota!

and rapid, population growth. It's like comparing a big bank account and
a small one. If they both grow at about the same rate over
many years, the big one gains a lot more money, simply because it started with more. So the billion-dollar, er, billion-person
question, is why did India and China have so many people when they started their rapid
growth? We can’t know for sure, since so many variables
factor into long-term population dynamics, but the two most plausible explanations are
food and area. Having lots of fertile land and good access
to fresh water makes it possible to grow lots of food, which in turn makes it possible to
nourish a lot of people. Even today, the 10 most populated countries
in the world all have a relatively large amount of farmland. And Asia - and in particular south and east
Asia - has tons of farmland, lots of river valleys, and the ability to grow food year-round. Plus, domestication of plants and animals
essentially started in Asia, giving populations an early leg - or wing - up. As such, Asia’s been the most densely populated
region of the world for a really long time. Area matters too; countries like Pakistan
and Bangladesh may be filled with farms and densely-populated, but because they’re smaller
in area than India and China, they simply cannot contain as many people. Of course, a few other things happened in
India and China in the last few thousand years, and some of them helped the populations grow,
and some of them shrank the populations, but through it all, the large and fertile lands
of India and China were able to sustain lots of people, such that when the era of modern
population growth came around, they had a head start. Or rather, a hundred-million-head start. This video was sponsored by the University
of Minnesota, where students, faculty and staff across all fields of study are working

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be unrelated to the transcript and the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the fact that it is the only one that has a numerical option, I would say that there is no match, but the least dissimilar would be:

None of the above.

But if I really had to choose, I would say that Question 2 is the least dissimilar, but only because it has 4 options like the ground truth MCQ, but the subject and the options are completely different.

But let me try again. Since the options in the generated MCQs do not match the options in the ground truth MCQ, let me look at the questions themselves.

Based on the content of the transcript, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ would be one that talks about population growth, countries, or years.

Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

However, I must provide an answer. In this case, I will provide the index of the first generated MCQ.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem unrelated to the topic of population growth and the transcript provided.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of them are similar. But if I really had to pick one, I would say Question 10, because it is the only one that is somewhat related to the topic of the transcript, although it does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

So, my answer would be: Question 10.

Please note that this is not a good match, and it would be better to generate new MCQs that are more relevant to the topic and the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the pressure in a plant's sieve tubes, while the generated MCQs are about unrelated topics such as Earth's water, meteoroids, comets, and planetary formation.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose an index, I would say -1 (not available) or "None" because there isn't a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

If you could provide more generated MCQs that are related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ (i.e., plant biology, aphids, sap, etc.), I would be happy to help you identify the most similar one.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, possibly the formation of the solar system and the origin of water on Earth.

If I had to choose one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the function of an aphid's stylet, which is a specific topic related to biology and entomology. The generated MCQs, on the other hand, are related to a different topic and do not mention aphids or stylets at all.

Therefore, I would not be able to provide an index of a similar generated MCQ. It would be best to generate new MCQs that are related to the topic of aphids and their biology.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about phonetics and asks where the "R" sound is heard in the word "rod", while the generated MCQs are about a completely different topic, Abraham Lincoln.

However, since I need to provide an answer, I will say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one based on the fact that it's the least unrelated, I would say:

**No match found**

But if I really had to choose one:

**Question 1** (only because it's the first question, but it's still completely unrelated)

Please note that this is not a good match, and the generated MCQs do not align with the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is about phonics and letter combinations, while the generated MCQs are about Abraham Lincoln's life, speeches, and messages.

However, since I need to provide an answer, I will say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one that is slightly related to language or reading, I would say Question 2, but it's still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are relevant to the transcript provided, which seems to be about children's songs and stories, and then try to find a match.

If I had to provide an index, I would say -1 or "No match found". But if I had to choose from the existing options, I would say:

Index: 2 (but please note that this is not a good match)

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the
eons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy
roughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule
that they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the
original package nor manufactured here, it must have flown in from far away, on meteoroids
or comets or other bodies originating in the outer solar system where they were far enough
from the Sun for frozen water to survive. Comets, being dirty iceballs, are a logical
candidate for the source of our water, but were ruled out when we discovered that they
are far richer in heavy hydrogen (that's hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its
nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost
line", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth
water, strongly suggesting that these earth-crashers are the source of our ice caps, clouds, rivers,
and oceans. And thus the water that turned our planet
into a blue marble came, quite literally,

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 1 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate answer would be that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of generated MCQs that are relevant to the topic of the transcript should be provided.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that are relevant to the topic of the transcript and match the ground truth MCQ more closely.

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the
eons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy
roughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule
that they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the
original package nor manufactured here, it must have flown in from far away, on meteoroids
or comets or other bodies originating in the outer solar system where they were far enough
from the Sun for frozen water to survive. Comets, being dirty iceballs, are a logical
candidate for the source of our water, but were ruled out when we discovered that they
are far richer in heavy hydrogen (that's hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its
nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost
line", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth
water, strongly suggesting that these earth-crashers are the source of our ice caps, clouds, rivers,
and oceans. And thus the water that turned our planet
into a blue marble came, quite literally,

**Transcript**:
In 1905, psychologists 
Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children 
who were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children
required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account 
that many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education 
or English language exposure, they created an erroneous 
intelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ
testing influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia 
created policy allowing for the forced sterilization 
of people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States 
Supreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government 
authorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust 
and the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both 
moral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence 
of environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically
recalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently
higher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, 
known as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused 
by inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely 
environmental— improved education, 
better healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted 
to use IQ tests to evaluate things other than 
general intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,
and other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on 
the clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests 
used to determine IQ— a practice later research found does 
not yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar
design elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for
identifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose
psychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice 
using subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose
learning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world 
still use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used 
to determine appropriate educational support,
job training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used 
to justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself 
is worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring
the reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing 
as measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated
political, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up 
in IQ testing, more and more researchers 
agree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals
can be categorized by a single numerical score.

**Transcript**:
In 1905, psychologists 
Alfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children 
who were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children
required individualized attention, their method formed 
the basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive
abilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying 
general intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of 
tests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results 
into a single score. Questions were adjusted 
for each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they 
performed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age 
and multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents 
the average of a sample population, with 68% of the population 
scoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills 
their test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon 
definition of general intelligence. And that left the door open 
for people to use the test in service of their own preconceived 
assumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify 
those who needed academic help quickly became used to sort 
people in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed 
ideologies. One of the first large-scale 
implementations occurred in the United States during WWI, 
when the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen 
them for officer training. At that time, many people 
believed in eugenics, the idea that desirable 
and undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled 
in humans through selective breeding. There were many problems 
with this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence
was not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results 
of the military initiative to make erroneous claims 
that certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account

You know much like buildings, text especially informational and nonfiction texts have to be structurally sound or else When you read informational texts you see the pattern in the way that its written. yeah There are five main structures you can check. Find the structure and they get less complex. Let's flex and break down all five. Follow me, the Text Structure Mastermind. This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se "such as" and "for example" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century. The tilt increased to more than five degrees. The people feared it would collapse into ruins. Now we know the problem what's the solution? [Earth] was removed from under the monument and weights were added to balance out the top of it They directed the lean- at least a little bit that problem and solution not a riddle, kid. Just look out for the words involved. Since question question problem solution and solve. I got another text you don't have to ask and its text structure? Compare and contrast. It explains how things are different in the same with the words in bold I'm about to say both the tower of Pisa's construction and the Washington monument saw disruption. The Washington monument, Named after George, had constuction paused for the Civil War. But the purposes of the buildings were different One was erected as a church bell tower while the other honored a Founding Father There we compared the two differenct structures thats five text structures in 1/16 of an hour In text, I find description, sequence, cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day In text I find description I find sequence cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day. There's a problem and solution I bet

You know much like buildings, text especially informational and nonfiction texts have to be structurally sound or else When you read informational texts you see the pattern in the way that its written. yeah There are five main structures you can check. Find the structure and they get less complex. Let's flex and break down all five. Follow me, the Text Structure Mastermind. This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se "such as" and "for example" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century. The tilt increased to more than five degrees. The people feared it would collapse into ruins. Now we know the problem what's the solution? [Earth] was removed from under the monument and weights were added to balance out the top of it They directed the lean- at least a little bit that problem and solution not a riddle, kid. Just look out for the words involved. Since question question problem solution and solve. I got another text you don't have to ask and its text structure? Compare and contrast. It explains how things are different in the same with the words in bold I'm about to say both the tower of Pisa's construction and the Washington monument saw disruption. The Washington monument, Named after George, had constuction paused for the Civil War. But the purposes of the buildings were different One was erected as a church bell tower while the other honored a Founding Father There we compared the two differenct structures thats five text structures in 1/16 of an hour In text, I find description, sequence, cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day In text I find description I find sequence cause and effect. You can compare and contrast all day, all day. There's a problem and solution I bet

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million 
metric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual 
emissions of 66 million cars. To better understand 
your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

your shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, 
midsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles 
like polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these
materials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients 
into synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,
further compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from 
natural sources like leather, but tanning this material 
relies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage 
freshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes 
are made of rubber that’s gone through a process 
called vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated 
raw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used 
natural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made 
with a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts 
for 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s 
carbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised 
of 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced 
by specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories 
to mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing 
every part under one roof. But the transportation 
required to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive 
at the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, 
baking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products 
can be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker 
requires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% 
of a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels 
another problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own 
or operate their factories, so the plants they work with 
are in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers 
earn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, 
like toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported 
to stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start 
wearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of 
so many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down 
into recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, 
while the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years 
to degrade. So, how can we balance 
our love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline 
design elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient
manufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support 
companies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, 
wear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all 
take steps towards a sustainable future.

**Transcript**:
Australians call them “runners." 
The British know them as “trainers." Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” 
or “sneakers." Whatever you call them, 
these rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people 
around the world. Originally invented 
in the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations 
have changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption 
is at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers 
than the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs 
a year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion 
shoes are produced each year, mostly in factories 
across China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become 
more complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved 
and for our planet. Shoe manufacturing 
accounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s 
carbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment
that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

that I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions
of that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second
of seeing my stranded car to pull over and run
across four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety
and made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure
I forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you
to that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed
the course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding
the human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,
and how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms
that it can take? These questions are really important
to understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,
and this includes everybody from philosophers
and economists to ordinary people believe that human nature
is fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated
by our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,
like the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,
like helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots
of extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people
who engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work
on this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent
definition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire
to help another individual. So it's a selfless act
intended to benefit only the other. What could possibly
explain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people
seem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains
of highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding
basic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people
in whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality
that's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial
and sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I
at the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever
brain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings
of other researchers now, have shown that people
who are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit
three characteristics. First, although they're not generally
insensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs
that other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing
fearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey
urgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit
compassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people
who tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important
for recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people
who lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired
in recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes
in amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas
are underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have
trouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas
are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
There's a man out there, somewhere, who looks a little bit
like the actor Idris Elba, or at least he did 20 years ago. I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway
traffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident
that could have killed me. And the whole thing
left me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this
kind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him
caused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life
to save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his
or anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home
in Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog
darted out in front of my car. And I did exactly
what you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why
you're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up
in the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment

are smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings
are reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding
why people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion
and the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also
the opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize
other people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive
to this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population
of truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given
one of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered
to undergo major surgery so that one of their own
healthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. "Why would anybody do this?"
is a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these
extraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing
other people's fear. They're literally better at detecting
when somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala
is more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part
of the brain that we found was underreactive
in people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas
are larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something
like a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end
by people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people
who are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes
extraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're
more compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate
and altruistic not just towards people
who are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people
that you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion
extends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider
circle of acquaintances to people who are outside
their social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now
to ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate
such a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give
a complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult
question for them to answer. I say, "How is it that
you're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?" And what do they say? They say, "Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else." And I think that's actually
a really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles
of these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally
don't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently
important than anybody else. When I asked one altruist
why donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, "Because it's not about me." Another said, "I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out
that I'm just the same as you." I think the best description
for this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality
that in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's
no center of your circle, there can be no inner rings
or outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy
of your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really
distinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view
of the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this
because at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion
are already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker
and others have shown that all around the world people
are becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening
circles of others, which has led to declines
of all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence
to capital punishment. And it's led to increases
in all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people
would have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate
their blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that
a hundred years from now people will think
that donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood
and bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root
of all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth
and standards of living. As societies become
wealthier and better off, people seem to turn
their focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism
towards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations
and even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is
becoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception
that it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be
that we now just know so much more about the suffering
of strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering
of those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds
of changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature
as cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem
to be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability
to remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion
outward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on
wood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked
called "sfumato"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- "sfumato"-- which is the kind
of smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially
around her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the
softness and realness of Lisa but also gives an
atmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect
in some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading
around the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly
secular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is
looking directly out at us-- and with her famous
smile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers
ran the image through emotion-recognition
software, which rated features like curvature around the lips
and crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to
be 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than
1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but
it's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--
a smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's
caught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,
looking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes
it so indelible an image. It has always been one of
the treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't
until after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after
it was returned, more than 100,000
people came to see it. And they really haven't
stopped since then, with millions meeting
her gaze each year. Many copies of the
painting exist, and much debate about
who painted them. Researchers recently found
that one version, at the Prado, was probably painted
by an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,
following his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,
while striking, doesn't capture the mystery
and majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas
and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 13, Ground Truth Question 3, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
NARRATOR: Jay-Z and
Beyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,
Cara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about
her; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp
parodied her in 1919. Someone more recently
made a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we
continue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the
original Renaissance man, who painted "The Last
Supper" and was also an inventor, architect,
engineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,
while living in Florence. It was the height of
the Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in
humanism, as well as a growing merchant class with
disposable income, had popularized
portrait-painting. We call it the "Mona
Lisa," "Mona" being short for "Madonna," or
"lady," and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del
Giocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant
at the age of 15 and would have been about
24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting "La
Gioconda," the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise
call it "La Joconde," which conveniently invokes
the Latin "jocundus" and its derivatives, meaning
"pleasant" or "agreeable." Lisa's husband,
Francesco, likely commissioned the portrait on
the occasion of their moving into a new home, or
possibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never
actually got to them. Francesco might not
have paid for it, or Leonardo could have
put off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained
in the artist's possession until his death
in 1519, after he had joined the royal court of
King Francois I. From there, the painting became the
property of the king. And, after a stay at
Versailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,
in the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except
when this guy walked it out of the museum, under his
shirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to
return the painting to an Italian museum which he
felt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,
until World War II came along, and it was shuffled around
France for safekeeping, sometimes even on a
stretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau
in the Loire valley, to an abbey in the
south of France, to museums farther south,
until it could finally be returned to Paris
after the end of the war. While many portraits of
the time were more closely cropped and painted
in profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally
and shown in half length. Her hands are included, with
her right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed
fairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off
with the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a
loggia, or an open-air room, which looks out
over a landscape. It was made with oil paint on

and, of course, many plays on the original, with
artists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at
age 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who
drew the connection between this original celebrity
and the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our
attention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be
rising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,
reinterpretations, merchandisfications,
and bastardisations. Which raises the question
of whether, at this point, the "Mona Lisa" is
famous primarily because it's a masterpiece
or famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our
identification with Lisa is more intense than
ever, as we see around us more and more
images of ourselves looking out, staring into
the eyes of unknown millions. While you're at

**Transcript**:
So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out
what makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen
a little frivolous, especially at a time where
we're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness
might provide a key to solving some of the toughest
problems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade
to figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in "Science"
with my collaborators, entitled, "Spending Money
on Others Promotes Happiness." I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow
I was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe
there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

there was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response
to giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed
that even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues
Kiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under
the age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource
that toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall
of Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give
some of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found
even more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,
I don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.
Researcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained
research assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them
our hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers
were pretty happy when they got this pile
of Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give
some of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving
persists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys
from more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third
of the world's population reported giving at least some money
to charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every
major region of the world, people who gave money to charity
were happier than those who did not, even after taking into account
their own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same
difference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough
to stumble on an effect that replicates around the world
in children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure
reinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving
might be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them
in the "New York Times." One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself
seated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line
of my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career
by showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about
the Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably
make a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website
of an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned
about the Group of Five. The Canadian government
allows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money
to support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally
get on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think
is so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering
with a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years
of paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family
would be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out
on evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned
and assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge
with milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport
to meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier
through the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than
5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really
evolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked
to donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family
to their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took
to help them be happy. This experience made me think
a little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense
of connection with those they were helping and could easily envision
the difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity
to donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared
the same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just
such a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation
will make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net
offers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net
to protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money
people gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported
feeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional
return on investment was completely eliminated
when people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just
giving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars
are going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program
takes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when
the refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,
my six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, "Mommy, who is the oldest
kid in our family?" I assumed he was talking
about his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations
have offered to help, providing everything
from free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness
that exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group
tried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels
were supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old
did not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits
of riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four
and barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words
he definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,
I'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!
You're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping
that human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens
to sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK
are starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different
the refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful
connections between individuals provides an opportunity
to deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks
from where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest
urban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether
to bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people
right here already struggling. My friend Evan told me
that when he was a kid and his parents drove
through this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents
never would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors
of a local restaurant and invite this community inside
to enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build
is called "Plenty of Plates," and the goal is not just
to provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise
might never make eye contact. Each night, a local business
sponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed
to people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches
for this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program
extend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides
an opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,
one volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding
this neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact
as he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable
of finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this
to happen automatically. Spending money helping others
doesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think
about charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate
our shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors
with pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact
that their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals
and communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving
as something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of
the best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy
in helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving
as just this moral obligation and start thinking of it
as a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)

**Transcript**:
This octopus is making a quick escape… with the help of its suckers. The suckers are incredibly strong. And while we only have two hands to grab things,
an octopus holds on with hundreds of suckers running up and down each arm. Suckers come in pretty handy to get around. Or to grab a bite to eat. Or to hang onto your keeper’s arm. So how do suckers stick so well? It’s not super glue. It’s water pressure. Each sucker has a ring called an infundibulum. It creates a water-tight seal. Inside the sucker there’s a chamber, like
a cup, called the acetabulum. It’s full of water. When the octopus expands the chamber, it lowers
the pressure inside. The higher pressure outside pushes against
the sucker creating a powerful grip. Suckers get such a workout that their skin
sloughs off every few weeks. See that ring-shaped piece of skin floating
by? It used to be the bottom of a sucker. Suckers have another super-power. They actually can smell and taste. That helps the octopus tell there’s no snail
inside this shell. Hundreds of suckers tasting and smelling,
and flexible arms moving every which way, create a huge amount of information -- a lot
for the octopus’ central brain to process. So each arm has a mind of its own. In fact, two thirds of an octopus’ neurons
are in its arms. That means the central brain isn’t really
calling all the shots. The central brain tells the arms how fast
to move. But the instructions on how to reach come
from each arm. It’s a nifty way to process all that information,
making the octopus the well-choreographed creature we know. AMY: Hi. This is Amy Standen. You may have noticed a different voice on

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
India and China, together, are home to over
2.7 billion people. That's as many humans as in the next 20 most
populous countries combined, or in the whole other 170 countries in the world. Over the last 300 years, India and China each
added more than a billion people to their populations, way more than any other country,
but they have actually been growing at about the same rate as the rest of the world. They have a lot more people today because
they had a lot more people a few hundred years ago, when the world began its period of modern,
and rapid, population growth. It's like comparing a big bank account and
a small one. If they both grow at about the same rate over
many years, the big one gains a lot more money, simply because it started with more. So the billion-dollar, er, billion-person
question, is why did India and China have so many people when they started their rapid
growth? We can’t know for sure, since so many variables
factor into long-term population dynamics, but the two most plausible explanations are
food and area. Having lots of fertile land and good access
to fresh water makes it possible to grow lots of food, which in turn makes it possible to
nourish a lot of people. Even today, the 10 most populated countries
in the world all have a relatively large amount of farmland. And Asia - and in particular south and east
Asia - has tons of farmland, lots of river valleys, and the ability to grow food year-round. Plus, domestication of plants and animals
essentially started in Asia, giving populations an early leg - or wing - up. As such, Asia’s been the most densely populated
region of the world for a really long time. Area matters too; countries like Pakistan
and Bangladesh may be filled with farms and densely-populated, but because they’re smaller
in area than India and China, they simply cannot contain as many people. Of course, a few other things happened in
India and China in the last few thousand years, and some of them helped the populations grow,
and some of them shrank the populations, but through it all, the large and fertile lands
of India and China were able to sustain lots of people, such that when the era of modern
population growth came around, they had a head start. Or rather, a hundred-million-head start. This video was sponsored by the University

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
This is Mabel. Mabel is an aphid, a small insect 
in the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey 
and suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after 
is buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells 
strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

strung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together 
they form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar 
per liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly 
producing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” 
which generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— 
in the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,
which is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, 
between the plant’s cells, until she pierces 
one of those sieve tubes. Because the sap 
is under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out 
of the plant. She just opens a valve in her head 
and lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out 
of her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want 
to be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s 
hypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract 
to a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, 
its high sugar content encourages the water in the cells 
to come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water 
to come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through 
the insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed 
with an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose 
and converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… 
this three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, 
leaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar 
that are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out 
of Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules 
of sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water 
out of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, 
getting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species 
have an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, 
and the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, 
all the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, 
they don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… 
that are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… 
with their own clones. So, these female aphids have 
two generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves 
at the same time. Scientists call this 
telescopic development. That means that aphids can make 
more of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations 
within a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight 
every two hours, making her one of the most prolific 
poopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce 
hundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different 
from sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, 
syrupy liquid. You might already know it 
by a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much 
they sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply 
of sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly 
from the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes 
used to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey 
from honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, 
which is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, 
harvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea.

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the
eons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy
roughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule
that they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the
original package nor manufactured here, it must have flown in from far away, on meteoroids
or comets or other bodies originating in the outer solar system where they were far enough
from the Sun for frozen water to survive. Comets, being dirty iceballs, are a logical
candidate for the source of our water, but were ruled out when we discovered that they
are far richer in heavy hydrogen (that's hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its
nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost
line", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth
water, strongly suggesting that these earth-crashers are the source of our ice caps, clouds, rivers,
and oceans. And thus the water that turned our planet
into a blue marble came, quite literally,

nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost
line", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth
water, strongly suggesting that these earth-crashers are the source of our ice caps, clouds, rivers,
and oceans. And thus the water that turned our planet
into a blue marble came, quite literally,

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 22, Ground Truth Question 6, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Unlike every other planet in our solar system,
Earth's surface is 70% liquid water, which while useful for life, is also kind of weird,
because everything we know about how and when our planet formed says Earth's surface should
be bone dry. The story goes like this: our solar system
formed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at
the center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce
solar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther
and farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,
and finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form
of ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early
inner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been
blasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how
did we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the
eons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy
roughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule
that they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the
original package nor manufactured here, it must have flown in from far away, on meteoroids
or comets or other bodies originating in the outer solar system where they were far enough
from the Sun for frozen water to survive. Comets, being dirty iceballs, are a logical
candidate for the source of our water, but were ruled out when we discovered that they
are far richer in heavy hydrogen (that's hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its
nucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are
heavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical
signatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for
Earth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. "Chondrite" is just
the name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only
the carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't
tell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's "frost
line", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth

into a blue marble came, quite literally,
