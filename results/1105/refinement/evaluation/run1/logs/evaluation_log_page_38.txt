Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 1, Question 1
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
What if, thousands of years from now, all
that was left of you…was your poop? I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. Every poop is a nugget of information. Poop records what we eat, where we live, even
how we died. So when archaeologists find the fossilized
poop of ancient humans, they get kind of excited. These poop fossils are called coprolites,
and they’re pretty rare. Although we make a lot of them, feces are
tough to preserve. But there are a few ways poop manages to stick
around for posterity. It can dry out—in caves or in a mummy’s
desiccated intestines. Particularly impressive poops can leave dents
in the earth that get filled in—creating a cast and mold of the ancient bowel movement. And a turd can also turn to stone, when minerals
in water slowly permeate and replace the molecules in the turd. Whatever else was in the poop gets mineralized
as well. Take this nearly 8-inch, 1000-year-old Viking
monstrosity discovered in England. The poor Viking who created this treasure
was infested with tons of intestinal parasites like whipworms, which were preserved along
with the giant poo, illustrating just how squalid everyday life was back then. And this guy wasn’t an anomaly—archaeologists
have also found cesspits (essentially Viking sewers) that were filled with parasite eggs. Poop can also tell us who was living where. In Puerto Rico, the contents of 1-2 millennia-old
coprolites backed up the archaeological evidence that native populations on the island at the
time were two distinct cultural groups, with different diets, and different parasites. Fossilized turds can even shed light on ancient
murder mysteries. In Medieval Verona, the warlord Cangrande
della Scala—patron of the poet Dante Alighieri—died at the age of 38 after a severe bout of vomiting
and diarrhea. Rumors of foul-play spread, though at the
time no one could prove it. But nearly 700 years later, researchers dug
up the body and analyzed the feces that were preserved in the corpse’s rectum. They found out that he had ingested a poisonous
plant before he died. And from the chamomile and mulberry pollen
preserved in the poop as well, the researchers surmised that he drank a poisoned tea that
killed him. So the next time you grab your newspaper and
head to the bathroom, think about it not so much as going number 2, but as contributing
to the archaeological record. Ew.

in the earth that get filled in—creating a cast and mold of the ancient bowel movement. And a turd can also turn to stone, when minerals
in water slowly permeate and replace the molecules in the turd. Whatever else was in the poop gets mineralized
as well. Take this nearly 8-inch, 1000-year-old Viking
monstrosity discovered in England. The poor Viking who created this treasure
was infested with tons of intestinal parasites like whipworms, which were preserved along
with the giant poo, illustrating just how squalid everyday life was back then. And this guy wasn’t an anomaly—archaeologists
have also found cesspits (essentially Viking sewers) that were filled with parasite eggs. Poop can also tell us who was living where. In Puerto Rico, the contents of 1-2 millennia-old
coprolites backed up the archaeological evidence that native populations on the island at the
time were two distinct cultural groups, with different diets, and different parasites. Fossilized turds can even shed light on ancient
murder mysteries. In Medieval Verona, the warlord Cangrande
della Scala—patron of the poet Dante Alighieri—died at the age of 38 after a severe bout of vomiting
and diarrhea. Rumors of foul-play spread, though at the
time no one could prove it. But nearly 700 years later, researchers dug
up the body and analyzed the feces that were preserved in the corpse’s rectum. They found out that he had ingested a poisonous
plant before he died. And from the chamomile and mulberry pollen
preserved in the poop as well, the researchers surmised that he drank a poisoned tea that
killed him. So the next time you grab your newspaper and
head to the bathroom, think about it not so much as going number 2, but as contributing
to the archaeological record. Ew.

**Transcript**:
What if, thousands of years from now, all
that was left of you…was your poop? I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. Every poop is a nugget of information. Poop records what we eat, where we live, even
how we died. So when archaeologists find the fossilized
poop of ancient humans, they get kind of excited. These poop fossils are called coprolites,
and they’re pretty rare. Although we make a lot of them, feces are
tough to preserve. But there are a few ways poop manages to stick
around for posterity. It can dry out—in caves or in a mummy’s

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3: What can poop fossils reveal about ancient cultures? Options: A. Only their social status, B. Only their diet, C. Their diet, living conditions, and parasites, D. None of the above Correct Option: C.

However, this is not an exact match. A more suitable match would be a question that mentions cesspits. Since there isn't a direct match, I will choose the question that is closest in terms of content.

A better match is Question 5: What is unique about the 1000-year-old Viking poop fossil found in England? Options: A. It is the largest poop fossil ever found, B. It contains a high amount of fiber, C. It is infested with whipworms and parasites, D. It is made of a rare type of material Correct Option: C.

This question is related to parasites in poop fossils, similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, it does not directly mention cesspits.

The closest match is not perfect, but I will choose Question 5 as the most similar generated MCQ.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 1, Ground Truth Question 5, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
What if, thousands of years from now, all
that was left of you…was your poop? I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. Every poop is a nugget of information. Poop records what we eat, where we live, even
how we died. So when archaeologists find the fossilized
poop of ancient humans, they get kind of excited. These poop fossils are called coprolites,
and they’re pretty rare. Although we make a lot of them, feces are
tough to preserve. But there are a few ways poop manages to stick
around for posterity. It can dry out—in caves or in a mummy’s
desiccated intestines. Particularly impressive poops can leave dents
in the earth that get filled in—creating a cast and mold of the ancient bowel movement. And a turd can also turn to stone, when minerals
in water slowly permeate and replace the molecules in the turd. Whatever else was in the poop gets mineralized
as well. Take this nearly 8-inch, 1000-year-old Viking
monstrosity discovered in England. The poor Viking who created this treasure
was infested with tons of intestinal parasites like whipworms, which were preserved along
with the giant poo, illustrating just how squalid everyday life was back then. And this guy wasn’t an anomaly—archaeologists
have also found cesspits (essentially Viking sewers) that were filled with parasite eggs. Poop can also tell us who was living where. In Puerto Rico, the contents of 1-2 millennia-old
coprolites backed up the archaeological evidence that native populations on the island at the
time were two distinct cultural groups, with different diets, and different parasites. Fossilized turds can even shed light on ancient
murder mysteries. In Medieval Verona, the warlord Cangrande
della Scala—patron of the poet Dante Alighieri—died at the age of 38 after a severe bout of vomiting
and diarrhea. Rumors of foul-play spread, though at the
time no one could prove it. But nearly 700 years later, researchers dug
up the body and analyzed the feces that were preserved in the corpse’s rectum. They found out that he had ingested a poisonous
plant before he died. And from the chamomile and mulberry pollen
preserved in the poop as well, the researchers surmised that he drank a poisoned tea that
killed him. So the next time you grab your newspaper and
head to the bathroom, think about it not so much as going number 2, but as contributing
to the archaeological record. Ew.
