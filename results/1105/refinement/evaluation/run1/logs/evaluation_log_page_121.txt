**Transcript**:
What's the most important century
in human history? Some might argue it’s a period 
of extensive military campaigning, like Alexander the Great’s 
in the 300s BCE, which reshaped political
and cultural borders. Others might cite the emergence 
of a major religion, such as Islam in the 7th century, which codified and spread values
across such borders. Or perhaps it’s the Industrial Revolution
of the 1700s that transformed global commerce and redefined humanity's relationship
with labor. Whatever the answer, it seems like 
any century vying for that top spot is at a moment of great change— when the actions of our ancestors shifted
humanity’s trajectory for centuries to come. So if this is our metric, 
is it possible that right now— this century— 
is the most important one yet? The 21st century has already proven to be
a period of rapid technological growth. Phones and computers have accelerated
the pace of life. And we’re likely on the cusp of developing
new transformative technologies, like advanced artificial intelligence, that could entirely change 
the way people live. Meanwhile, many technologies 
we already have contribute to humanity’s unprecedented 
levels of existential risk— that’s the risk of our
species going extinct or experiencing some kind of disaster
that permanently limits humanity’s ability to grow and thrive. The invention of the atomic bomb marked
a major rise in existential risk, and since then we’ve only increased
the odds against us. It’s profoundly difficult
to estimate the odds of an existential collapse 
occurring this century. Very rough guesses put the risk 
of existential catastrophe due to nuclear winter and climate change
at around 0.1%, with the odds of a pandemic causing
the same kind of collapse at a frightening 3%. Given that any of these disasters could 
mean the end of life as we know it, these aren’t exactly small figures, And it’s possible this century could see
the rise of new technologies that introduce more existential risks. AI experts have a wide range 
of estimates regarding when artificial general intelligence
will emerge, but according to some surveys,
many believe it could happen this century. Currently, we have relatively narrow forms
of artificial intelligence, which are designed to do specific tasks 
like play chess or recognize faces. Even narrow AIs that do creative work are
limited to their singular specialty. But artificial general intelligences,
or AGIs, would be able to adapt to and
perform any number of tasks, quickly outpacing 
their human counterparts. There are a huge variety of guesses
about what AGI could look like, and what it would mean
for humanity to share the Earth with another sentient entity. AGIs might help us achieve our goals, they might regard us as inconsequential, or, they might see us as an obstacle
to swiftly remove. So in terms of existential risk, it's imperative the values of this new
technology align with our own. This is an incredibly difficult
philosophical and engineering challenge that will require a lot 
of delicate, thoughtful work. Yet, even if we succeed, AGI could still
lead to another complicated outcome. Let’s imagine an AGI emerges 
with deep respect for human life and a desire to solve
all humanity’s troubles. But to avoid becoming misaligned, it's been developed to be incredibly
rigid about its beliefs. If these machines became 
the dominant power on Earth, their strict values might
become hegemonic, locking humanity into one ideology that
would be incredibly resistant to change. History has taught us that
no matter how enlightened a civilization thinks they are, they are rarely up to the moral standards
of later generations. And this kind of value lock in
could permanently distort or constrain humanity’s moral growth. There's a ton of uncertainty around AGI, and it’s profoundly difficult to predict
how any existential risks will play out over the next century. It’s also possible that new, 
more pressing concerns might render these risks moot. But even if we can't definitively say that
ours is the most important century, it still seems like the decisions 
we make might have a major impact on humanity’s future. So maybe we should all live 
like the future depends on us— because actually, it just might.

**Transcript**:
What's the most important century
in human history? Some might argue it’s a period 
of extensive military campaigning, like Alexander the Great’s 
in the 300s BCE, which reshaped political
and cultural borders. Others might cite the emergence 
of a major religion, such as Islam in the 7th century, which codified and spread values
across such borders. Or perhaps it’s the Industrial Revolution
of the 1700s that transformed global commerce and redefined humanity's relationship
with labor. Whatever the answer, it seems like 
any century vying for that top spot is at a moment of great change— when the actions of our ancestors shifted
humanity’s trajectory for centuries to come. So if this is our metric, 
is it possible that right now— this century— 
is the most important one yet? The 21st century has already proven to be
a period of rapid technological growth. Phones and computers have accelerated
the pace of life. And we’re likely on the cusp of developing
new transformative technologies, like advanced artificial intelligence, that could entirely change 
the way people live. Meanwhile, many technologies 
we already have contribute to humanity’s unprecedented 
levels of existential risk— that’s the risk of our
species going extinct or experiencing some kind of disaster
that permanently limits humanity’s ability to grow and thrive. The invention of the atomic bomb marked
a major rise in existential risk, and since then we’ve only increased
the odds against us. It’s profoundly difficult
to estimate the odds of an existential collapse 
occurring this century. Very rough guesses put the risk 
of existential catastrophe due to nuclear winter and climate change
at around 0.1%, with the odds of a pandemic causing
the same kind of collapse at a frightening 3%. Given that any of these disasters could 
mean the end of life as we know it, these aren’t exactly small figures, And it’s possible this century could see
the rise of new technologies that introduce more existential risks. AI experts have a wide range 
of estimates regarding when artificial general intelligence
will emerge, but according to some surveys,
many believe it could happen this century. Currently, we have relatively narrow forms
of artificial intelligence, which are designed to do specific tasks 
like play chess or recognize faces. Even narrow AIs that do creative work are
limited to their singular specialty. But artificial general intelligences,
or AGIs, would be able to adapt to and
perform any number of tasks, quickly outpacing 
their human counterparts. There are a huge variety of guesses
about what AGI could look like, and what it would mean
for humanity to share the Earth with another sentient entity. AGIs might help us achieve our goals, they might regard us as inconsequential, or, they might see us as an obstacle
to swiftly remove. So in terms of existential risk, it's imperative the values of this new
technology align with our own. This is an incredibly difficult
philosophical and engineering challenge that will require a lot 
of delicate, thoughtful work. Yet, even if we succeed, AGI could still
lead to another complicated outcome. Let’s imagine an AGI emerges 
with deep respect for human life and a desire to solve
all humanity’s troubles. But to avoid becoming misaligned, it's been developed to be incredibly
rigid about its beliefs. If these machines became 
the dominant power on Earth, their strict values might
become hegemonic, locking humanity into one ideology that
would be incredibly resistant to change. History has taught us that
no matter how enlightened a civilization thinks they are, they are rarely up to the moral standards
of later generations. And this kind of value lock in
could permanently distort or constrain humanity’s moral growth. There's a ton of uncertainty around AGI, and it’s profoundly difficult to predict
how any existential risks will play out over the next century. It’s also possible that new, 
more pressing concerns might render these risks moot. But even if we can't definitively say that
ours is the most important century, it still seems like the decisions 
we make might have a major impact on humanity’s future. So maybe we should all live 
like the future depends on us— because actually, it just might.

**Transcript**:
In this south Texas clearing, an ancient tale that ties the members 
of four species together is unfurling. The first involved is our soon-to-be
queen leafcutter ant. The second is this fungus, a piece of
which she scoops into her mouth pocket. The third are these tiny cockroaches,
which nestle under her wings. And the fourth is the one
that threatens them all. But it’ll reveal itself later. In a flapping-wing frenzy,
our ant takes to the sky. This is the only chance
she’ll have to mate, so she stores as much sperm as she can
from the males she meets in midair. After dropping to the ground, 
she sheds her wings and begins digging. She excavates a tunnel and a side chamber,
then plugs the entrance, sealing herself in. There, she regurgitates the fungus. This pile of puke will form 
the bedrock of her kingdom. Over the following weeks, in between laying eggs 
and consuming the infertile ones, she tends to her developing fungal garden, fertilizing it with feces. Finally, her first offspring surge
forth and establish a rhythm. Soldiers guard the nest while foragers
set off to find tender foliage. The larger foragers, 
equipped with powerful mandibles, anchor themselves on leaves 
and chomp away in a wide arcs. Holding these pieces aloft, which can weigh more than eight times
their body mass, the workers march back to the nest. Meanwhile, the colony’s smallest ants
clean the leaf fragments of debris and pathogens. But the colony doesn’t eat these morsels. Instead, the ants use them
to sustain their fungus, which, in turn, sustains the colony. More than 10 million years ago, 
leafcutter ants domesticated fungus. Like many of our crops, 
the fungus they farm is genetically distinct 
from its wild relatives and can no longer survive
without their help. Reciprocally, the fungus provides 
the ants with an essential amino acid and digestive enzymes they’ve lost. Once the workers return 
to the nest with their spoils, they crush up the leaves, making their offerings easier 
for the fungus to consume. Foragers work tirelessly 
over the following months. They create thousands of trails,
stretching hundreds of meters. All of them are perfumed 
with the ants’ pheromones and constantly cleaned 
to function as efficient highways. Meanwhile, the queen lays thousands
of eggs every day and is tended to by members
of her entourage, which nourish her 
with the large, infertile eggs they lay. Among enclosures containing
garbage and growing larvae, workers tend fungal gardens in various
chambers throughout the colony. They prune bits of the fungus 
to stimulate growth and strategically open and close
surface tunnels, controlling the humidity. But ants aren't the only
animals down here. Tiny cockroaches like those that
originally crept under the queen’s wings feed opportunistically off the fungus. Each could fit on the head of a Q-Tip. They hitch rides on soon-to-be queens, and make their way 
to more established colonies. Inside the leafcutter nest,
they’re undercover: closely mimicking the ants’
signature scent, they frolic and feed 
in the fungal gardens, mostly undetected. And here’s where this tale’s antagonist
rears its virulent fruiting body: our elusive fourth character is a 
parasitic micro-fungus called Escovopsis. If left unchecked, it would destroy 
the fungal gardens and the ants and the cockroaches that depend on them. The leafcutters mount 
a barrage of defenses. They rigorously weed Escovopsis out and partner up with different
microorganisms like yeasts and bacteria to stunt its growth. Eventually, the leafcutter colony covers
several meters of underground tunnels, comprises millions of workers, and can
defoliate a tree in a single night. The queen’s kingdom will persist 
as long as she does, which may be over a decade. Every spring, some of the queen’s
offspring prepare to leave. They grab a piece of home 
and crowd the surface chambers, preparing to fly off and mate, 
beginning the cycle anew.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 3. 

However, Question 3 does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ, as it focuses on the significance of the fungus in the leafcutter ant colony, whereas the ground truth MCQ specifically asks what happens to the leaves forager ants cut down.

A more similar generated MCQ would be one that directly addresses the fate of the cut-down leaves. Unfortunately, none of the provided generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. 

However, if I had to choose the most similar one, I would say Question 10 is not the most similar, but Question 3 and Question 10 have the correct answer that could lead us to understand the fate of the leaves. The leaves are used to sustain the fungus.

But among all the questions, I think Question 3 has more relation to the Ground Truth MCQ.
So the index of the most similar generated MCQ is 3.

she sheds her wings and begins digging. She excavates a tunnel and a side chamber,
then plugs the entrance, sealing herself in. There, she regurgitates the fungus. This pile of puke will form 
the bedrock of her kingdom. Over the following weeks, in between laying eggs 
and consuming the infertile ones, she tends to her developing fungal garden, fertilizing it with feces. Finally, her first offspring surge
forth and establish a rhythm. Soldiers guard the nest while foragers
set off to find tender foliage. The larger foragers, 
equipped with powerful mandibles, anchor themselves on leaves 
and chomp away in a wide arcs. Holding these pieces aloft, which can weigh more than eight times
their body mass, the workers march back to the nest. Meanwhile, the colony’s smallest ants
clean the leaf fragments of debris and pathogens. But the colony doesn’t eat these morsels. Instead, the ants use them
to sustain their fungus, which, in turn, sustains the colony. More than 10 million years ago, 
leafcutter ants domesticated fungus. Like many of our crops, 
the fungus they farm is genetically distinct 
from its wild relatives and can no longer survive
without their help. Reciprocally, the fungus provides 
the ants with an essential amino acid and digestive enzymes they’ve lost. Once the workers return 
to the nest with their spoils, they crush up the leaves, making their offerings easier 
for the fungus to consume. Foragers work tirelessly 
over the following months. They create thousands of trails,
stretching hundreds of meters. All of them are perfumed 
with the ants’ pheromones and constantly cleaned 
to function as efficient highways. Meanwhile, the queen lays thousands
of eggs every day and is tended to by members
of her entourage, which nourish her 
with the large, infertile eggs they lay. Among enclosures containing
garbage and growing larvae, workers tend fungal gardens in various
chambers throughout the colony. They prune bits of the fungus 
to stimulate growth and strategically open and close
surface tunnels, controlling the humidity. But ants aren't the only
animals down here. Tiny cockroaches like those that
originally crept under the queen’s wings feed opportunistically off the fungus. Each could fit on the head of a Q-Tip. They hitch rides on soon-to-be queens, and make their way 
to more established colonies. Inside the leafcutter nest,
they’re undercover: closely mimicking the ants’
signature scent, they frolic and feed 
in the fungal gardens, mostly undetected. And here’s where this tale’s antagonist
rears its virulent fruiting body: our elusive fourth character is a 
parasitic micro-fungus called Escovopsis. If left unchecked, it would destroy 
the fungal gardens and the ants and the cockroaches that depend on them. The leafcutters mount 
a barrage of defenses. They rigorously weed Escovopsis out and partner up with different
microorganisms like yeasts and bacteria to stunt its growth. Eventually, the leafcutter colony covers
several meters of underground tunnels, comprises millions of workers, and can
defoliate a tree in a single night. The queen’s kingdom will persist 
as long as she does, which may be over a decade. Every spring, some of the queen’s
offspring prepare to leave. They grab a piece of home 
and crowd the surface chambers, preparing to fly off and mate, 
beginning the cycle anew.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 8. 

However, the options provided in Question 8 do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ. A more accurate match in terms of options would be Question 2, but the question itself does not match the ground truth MCQ.

Upon closer inspection, Question 11 has an option that closely matches the correct option of the ground truth MCQ, but the question itself does not match.

Considering all the generated MCQs, the one that best matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent is Question 8, but with the correct option being similar to the one in Question 11.

However, if we were to choose an MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of the queen's action while founding a new colony, it would be Question 2, as it mentions the queen fertilizing her fungal garden by regurgitating the fungus and adding feces, and also mentions that she starts laying eggs.

But if we were to choose the most similar MCQ based solely on the question, it would be Question 8.

However, none of the questions exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to choose one, I would say Question 8 is the closest match.

However, I noticed that Question 2 has the phrase "regurgitates the fungus" and also mentions that "she tends to her developing fungal garden, fertilizing it with feces"  from the transcript which happens right after the queen seals herself in the nest.

And then I noticed Question 8 has the correct answer which says "She is responsible for laying eggs and tending to the fungal garden" 

And then I noticed the ground truth MCQ says "While founding a new colony, queens" "Seal themselves inside their nest and start laying eggs"

So taking into consideration the events that occur while the queen is founding the new colony, I believe that the correct MCQ should be a combination of Question 2 and Question 8.

However, I must choose one, so I will choose Question 8 because the correct option for Question 8 is more similar to the correct option of the ground truth MCQ than the correct option for Question 2.

However, I noticed that I made an error, I should choose Question 2 because the events that occur in Question 2 are more similar to the events that occur in the ground truth MCQ.

In this south Texas clearing, an ancient tale that ties the members 
of four species together is unfurling. The first involved is our soon-to-be
queen leafcutter ant. The second is this fungus, a piece of
which she scoops into her mouth pocket. The third are these tiny cockroaches,
which nestle under her wings. And the fourth is the one
that threatens them all. But it’ll reveal itself later. In a flapping-wing frenzy,
our ant takes to the sky. This is the only chance
she’ll have to mate, so she stores as much sperm as she can
from the males she meets in midair. After dropping to the ground, 
she sheds her wings and begins digging. She excavates a tunnel and a side chamber,
then plugs the entrance, sealing herself in. There, she regurgitates the fungus. This pile of puke will form 
the bedrock of her kingdom. Over the following weeks, in between laying eggs 
and consuming the infertile ones, she tends to her developing fungal garden, fertilizing it with feces. Finally, her first offspring surge
forth and establish a rhythm. Soldiers guard the nest while foragers
set off to find tender foliage. The larger foragers, 
equipped with powerful mandibles, anchor themselves on leaves 
and chomp away in a wide arcs. Holding these pieces aloft, which can weigh more than eight times
their body mass, the workers march back to the nest. Meanwhile, the colony’s smallest ants
clean the leaf fragments of debris and pathogens. But the colony doesn’t eat these morsels. Instead, the ants use them
to sustain their fungus, which, in turn, sustains the colony. More than 10 million years ago, 
leafcutter ants domesticated fungus. Like many of our crops, 
the fungus they farm is genetically distinct 
from its wild relatives and can no longer survive
without their help. Reciprocally, the fungus provides 
the ants with an essential amino acid and digestive enzymes they’ve lost. Once the workers return 
to the nest with their spoils, they crush up the leaves, making their offerings easier 
for the fungus to consume. Foragers work tirelessly 
over the following months. They create thousands of trails,
stretching hundreds of meters. All of them are perfumed 
with the ants’ pheromones and constantly cleaned 
to function as efficient highways. Meanwhile, the queen lays thousands
of eggs every day and is tended to by members
of her entourage, which nourish her 
with the large, infertile eggs they lay. Among enclosures containing
garbage and growing larvae, workers tend fungal gardens in various
chambers throughout the colony. They prune bits of the fungus 
to stimulate growth and strategically open and close
surface tunnels, controlling the humidity. But ants aren't the only
animals down here. Tiny cockroaches like those that
originally crept under the queen’s wings feed opportunistically off the fungus. Each could fit on the head of a Q-Tip. They hitch rides on soon-to-be queens, and make their way 
to more established colonies. Inside the leafcutter nest,
they’re undercover: closely mimicking the ants’
signature scent, they frolic and feed 
in the fungal gardens, mostly undetected. And here’s where this tale’s antagonist
rears its virulent fruiting body: our elusive fourth character is a 
parasitic micro-fungus called Escovopsis. If left unchecked, it would destroy 
the fungal gardens and the ants and the cockroaches that depend on them. The leafcutters mount 
a barrage of defenses. They rigorously weed Escovopsis out and partner up with different
microorganisms like yeasts and bacteria to stunt its growth. Eventually, the leafcutter colony covers
several meters of underground tunnels, comprises millions of workers, and can
defoliate a tree in a single night. The queen’s kingdom will persist 
as long as she does, which may be over a decade. Every spring, some of the queen’s
offspring prepare to leave. They grab a piece of home 
and crowd the surface chambers, preparing to fly off and mate, 
beginning the cycle anew.

**Transcript**:
In 1971, Ian Waterman suddenly
collapsed from a severe case of what seemed to be gastric flu. His illness passed after a few days, but a stranger set of symptoms lingered. Although his muscles and joints
remained healthy, Waterman was unable to move. In fact, he was unable to feel
anything from the neck down. Eventually, he was diagnosed with a rare
and extreme form of deafferentation, a neurological condition 
in which certain signals from the nervous system are 
interrupted or impaired. Without his body's constant feedback
on how his limbs were moving, Waterman was unable to sit up,
stand, or walk. But over time, he taught himself
to use sight to judge the distance of his limbs from other objects. And eventually he regained 
complete control of his body— so long as he could see it. We often don’t think of touch 
as being a vital part of movement. But touch is just one part 
of the somatosensory system, a network that oversees all the sensations arising from the surface and interior 
of our bodies. Touch, pain, temperature, 
and our awareness of our bodies in space— also known as proprioception— 
are regulated by this system. And when something goes wrong,
the effects can be dramatic. All these sensations are processed
by millions of tiny receptor cells embedded in our skin, muscles,
tendons, and organs. Every square centimeter of our skin
is packed with hundreds of these cells, and their shape, size, and depth determine
what kind of stimuli they respond to. Mechanoreceptors sense mechanical
deformation of the skin. This could be triggered by low
or high frequency vibrations, a stretch, 
or simply light, static pressure. Thermoreceptors respond
to temperature changes, while nociceptors sense pain. And propriocepters sit deep 
in your muscles and tendons, continually detecting 
and relaying information about the position of your body. Your brain then combines this information
with other sensory data to move through space 
without needing to see your limbs. All of these receptors work by sending
electrical signals to the brain through fibers they’re attached to. And the speed of those signals 
varies with the fiber’s thickness. For example, some nociceptors 
are attached to fibers with slightly more conductive,
fatty myelin than others. So when you get hurt, the electrical
impulses from thicker nociceptors trigger sharp, intense pain, while thin, unmyelinated nociceptors
are responsible for the dull, aching pain that follows. And since the fibers carrying 
tactile information are much thicker than those carrying nociceptive signals, rubbing an injury can produce 
temporary relief from the pain These receptors generate 
a constant flood of signals that travel through the nervous system
to the brain. But if this process is disrupted— either by damage to the skin, 
the nerves, or the brain— the network breaks down. And since it underpins so many
bodily functions, damage to the somatosensory system can
manifest in a wide variety of ways. In Waterman’s case, 
an autoimmune reaction attacked a large swath 
of his nervous system, leaving him with no tactile 
or proprioceptive sensations from the neck down. But deafferentation is just one 
of many somatosensory disorders. Individuals can receive damage to a 
specific brain area or a section of skin, resulting in the loss of certain 
sensations in particular locations. And the impact of this loss
can be significant. Losing tactile sensations makes it
difficult to gauge how much strength to use in a situation. Without the warning signals provided
by thermal and pain stimuli, we don’t react when our
bodies are damaged. And, being deprived of social touch
can cause a condition known as touch starvation, characterized by anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, 
and even a weakened immune system. Many individuals who face these realities
have found innovative ways to adapt. But it’s undeniable that all these
invisible sensations play a vital role 
in how we navigate the world— even if they can be difficult
to put your finger on.

**Transcript**:
In 1971, Ian Waterman suddenly
collapsed from a severe case of what seemed to be gastric flu. His illness passed after a few days, but a stranger set of symptoms lingered. Although his muscles and joints
remained healthy, Waterman was unable to move. In fact, he was unable to feel
anything from the neck down. Eventually, he was diagnosed with a rare
and extreme form of deafferentation, a neurological condition 
in which certain signals from the nervous system are 
interrupted or impaired. Without his body's constant feedback
on how his limbs were moving, Waterman was unable to sit up,
stand, or walk. But over time, he taught himself
to use sight to judge the distance of his limbs from other objects. And eventually he regained 
complete control of his body— so long as he could see it. We often don’t think of touch 
as being a vital part of movement. But touch is just one part 
of the somatosensory system, a network that oversees all the sensations arising from the surface and interior 
of our bodies. Touch, pain, temperature, 
and our awareness of our bodies in space— also known as proprioception— 
are regulated by this system. And when something goes wrong,
the effects can be dramatic. All these sensations are processed
by millions of tiny receptor cells embedded in our skin, muscles,
tendons, and organs. Every square centimeter of our skin
is packed with hundreds of these cells, and their shape, size, and depth determine
what kind of stimuli they respond to. Mechanoreceptors sense mechanical
deformation of the skin. This could be triggered by low
or high frequency vibrations, a stretch, 
or simply light, static pressure. Thermoreceptors respond
to temperature changes, while nociceptors sense pain. And propriocepters sit deep 
in your muscles and tendons, continually detecting 
and relaying information about the position of your body. Your brain then combines this information
with other sensory data to move through space 
without needing to see your limbs. All of these receptors work by sending
electrical signals to the brain through fibers they’re attached to. And the speed of those signals 
varies with the fiber’s thickness. For example, some nociceptors 
are attached to fibers with slightly more conductive,
fatty myelin than others. So when you get hurt, the electrical
impulses from thicker nociceptors trigger sharp, intense pain, while thin, unmyelinated nociceptors
are responsible for the dull, aching pain that follows. And since the fibers carrying 
tactile information are much thicker than those carrying nociceptive signals, rubbing an injury can produce 
temporary relief from the pain These receptors generate 
a constant flood of signals that travel through the nervous system
to the brain. But if this process is disrupted— either by damage to the skin, 
the nerves, or the brain— the network breaks down. And since it underpins so many
bodily functions, damage to the somatosensory system can
manifest in a wide variety of ways. In Waterman’s case, 
an autoimmune reaction attacked a large swath 
of his nervous system, leaving him with no tactile 
or proprioceptive sensations from the neck down. But deafferentation is just one 
of many somatosensory disorders. Individuals can receive damage to a 
specific brain area or a section of skin, resulting in the loss of certain 
sensations in particular locations. And the impact of this loss
can be significant. Losing tactile sensations makes it
difficult to gauge how much strength to use in a situation. Without the warning signals provided

bodies are damaged. And, being deprived of social touch

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

Although Question 4 does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of wording, it shares a similar intent and content. Both questions discuss the relationship between the thickness of fibers carrying different types of sensations and the effect on pain perception. The correct option in Question 4 (B. Thicker fibers produce sharp pain, while thinner fibers produce dull pain) aligns with the explanation provided in the ground truth MCQ, which states that thicker nociceptors trigger sharp, intense pain, while thin, unmyelinated nociceptors are responsible for the dull, aching pain that follows.

However, it's worth noting that none of the generated MCQs perfectly match the ground truth MCQ. If I had to choose the most similar one, I would choose Question 4, but I would recommend generating new MCQs that more closely match the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
By 1917, Albert Einstein had explained 
the relationship between space and time. But, that year, he designed
a flawed airplane wing. His attempt was based 
on an incomplete theory of flight. Indeed, insufficient and inaccurate
explanations still circulate today. So, where did Einstein go wrong? And how do planes fly? Though we don’t always think of it
this way, air is a fluid medium— it’s just less dense 
than liquids like water. Things that are lighter than air
are buoyant within it, while heavier objects require an upward
force, called lift, to stay aloft. For planes, this force is mostly
generated by the wings. One especially pervasive false 
description of lift is the “Longer Path” 
or “Equal Transit Time” explanation. It states that air molecules traveling
over the top of a curved wing cover a longer distance than those
traveling underneath. For the air molecules above to reach
the wing’s trailing edge in the same instance as those 
that split off and went below, air must travel faster above, creating a pocket of lower pressure 
that lifts the plane. This explanation has
been thoroughly debunked. Air molecules floating above and below
the wing don't need to meet back up. In reality, the air traveling
above reaches the wing’s trailing edge much faster than the air beneath. To get a sense of how lift
is actually generated, let's simulate an airplane wing in motion. As it moves forward, the wing affects
the movement of the air around it. As air meets the wing’s solid surface,
a thin layer sticks to the wing. This layer pulls the surrounding
air with it. The air splits into pathways 
above and below the wing, following the wing’s contour. As the air that’s routed above makes 
its way around the nose of the wing, it experiences centripetal acceleration, the force you also feel 
in a sharply turning car. The air above therefore gathers more
speed than the air traveling below. This increased speed is coupled with a
decrease in pressure above the wing, which pulls even more air 
across the wing’s upper surface. The air flowing across the
lower surface, meanwhile, experiences less of a change
in direction and speed. The pressure across the wing’s 
lower surface is thus higher than that above the upper surface. This pressure difference results 
in the upwards force of lift. The faster the plane travels, the greater the pressure difference,
and the greater that force. Once it overcomes the downward force
of gravity, the plane takes off. Air flows smoothly around curved wings. But a wing’s curvature is
not the cause of lift. In fact, a flat wing that’s tilted 
upwards can also create lift— as long as the air bends around it, contributing to and reinforcing
the pressure difference. Meanwhile, having a wing
that’s too curved or steeply angled can be disastrous: the airflow above may detach 
from the wing and become turbulent. This is probably what happened 
with Einstein’s wing design, nicknamed “the cat’s back.” By increasing the wing’s curvature, Einstein thought it would 
generate more lift. But one test pilot reported 
that the plane wobbled like “a pregnant duck” in flight. Our explanation is still 
a simplified description of this nuanced, complex process. Other factors, like the air that’s flowing
meters beyond the wing’s surface— being swept up, then down— as well as air vortices formed
at the wing’s tips, all influence lift. And, while experts agree that 
the pressure difference generates lift, their explanations for how can vary. Some might emphasize the air’s behavior
at the wing’s surface, others the upward force created 
as the air is deflected downwards. However, there's no controversy
when it comes to the math. Engineers use a set of formulas 
called the Navier-Stokes equations to precisely model air’s flow 
around a wing and detail how lift is generated. More than a century after Einstein’s
foray into aeronautics, lift retains its reputation
as a confounding concept. But when it feels like it’s all going
to come crashing down, remember: it’s just the physics of fluid in motion. This video was made possible

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 6: What can happen to a wing if it is too curved or steeply angled? 

This question has the most similar intent and content to the ground truth MCQ, which asks why Einstein's wing failed. The correct option in Question 6, "D. All of the above," includes the statement "The airflow above may detach from the wing," which is related to the reason why Einstein's wing failed, as mentioned in the transcript: "having a wing that's too curved or steeply angled can be disastrous: the airflow above may detach from the wing and become turbulent."

However, an even more specific match can be found in the options of Question 6. Option A in the ground truth MCQ, "It was too curved, causing turbulence," is very similar to the statement in the transcript that explains why Einstein's wing failed.

But the best match is actually Question 1's Option A, "He was trying to create a wing that was too curved,"  which isn't the correct answer for Question 1.

Since we are looking for a generated question that has both the correct intent and the correct answer we will choose Question 6.

this way, air is a fluid medium— it’s just less dense 
than liquids like water. Things that are lighter than air
are buoyant within it, while heavier objects require an upward
force, called lift, to stay aloft. For planes, this force is mostly
generated by the wings. One especially pervasive false 
description of lift is the “Longer Path” 
or “Equal Transit Time” explanation. It states that air molecules traveling
over the top of a curved wing cover a longer distance than those
traveling underneath. For the air molecules above to reach
the wing’s trailing edge in the same instance as those 
that split off and went below, air must travel faster above, creating a pocket of lower pressure 
that lifts the plane. This explanation has
been thoroughly debunked. Air molecules floating above and below
the wing don't need to meet back up. In reality, the air traveling
above reaches the wing’s trailing edge much faster than the air beneath. To get a sense of how lift
is actually generated, let's simulate an airplane wing in motion. As it moves forward, the wing affects
the movement of the air around it. As air meets the wing’s solid surface,
a thin layer sticks to the wing. This layer pulls the surrounding
air with it. The air splits into pathways 
above and below the wing, following the wing’s contour. As the air that’s routed above makes 
its way around the nose of the wing, it experiences centripetal acceleration, the force you also feel 
in a sharply turning car. The air above therefore gathers more
speed than the air traveling below. This increased speed is coupled with a
decrease in pressure above the wing, which pulls even more air 
across the wing’s upper surface. The air flowing across the
lower surface, meanwhile, experiences less of a change
in direction and speed. The pressure across the wing’s 
lower surface is thus higher than that above the upper surface. This pressure difference results 
in the upwards force of lift. The faster the plane travels, the greater the pressure difference,
and the greater that force. Once it overcomes the downward force
of gravity, the plane takes off. Air flows smoothly around curved wings. But a wing’s curvature is
not the cause of lift. In fact, a flat wing that’s tilted 
upwards can also create lift— as long as the air bends around it, contributing to and reinforcing
the pressure difference. Meanwhile, having a wing
that’s too curved or steeply angled can be disastrous: the airflow above may detach 
from the wing and become turbulent. This is probably what happened 
with Einstein’s wing design, nicknamed “the cat’s back.” By increasing the wing’s curvature, Einstein thought it would 
generate more lift. But one test pilot reported 
that the plane wobbled like “a pregnant duck” in flight. Our explanation is still 
a simplified description of this nuanced, complex process. Other factors, like the air that’s flowing
meters beyond the wing’s surface— being swept up, then down— as well as air vortices formed
at the wing’s tips, all influence lift. And, while experts agree that 
the pressure difference generates lift, their explanations for how can vary. Some might emphasize the air’s behavior
at the wing’s surface, others the upward force created 
as the air is deflected downwards. However, there's no controversy
when it comes to the math. Engineers use a set of formulas 
called the Navier-Stokes equations to precisely model air’s flow 
around a wing and detail how lift is generated. More than a century after Einstein’s
foray into aeronautics, lift retains its reputation
as a confounding concept. But when it feels like it’s all going
to come crashing down, remember: it’s just the physics of fluid in motion. This video was made possible

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, based on the intent of the question, which is to understand the limitations of a specific principle in explaining lift, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match.

However, since it does not directly address the limitations of Bernoulli's principle, I must conclude that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

But if I had to choose one, I would say that the most similar generated MCQ is not available, but if I had to choose from the existing ones, I would say it is Question 5, but with a big caveat that it does not directly address the ground truth MCQ's intent.

However, I can suggest a possible generated MCQ that could match the ground truth MCQ:

Question: Why is Bernoulli's principle alone insufficient to explain lift?
Options: A. It only applies to liquids., B. It doesn't account for wing curvature., C. It doesn't explain why air travels faster above the wing., D. The explanation given by Bernoulli's principle alone is incomplete.

This question is not present in the generated MCQs, but it would be a good match for the ground truth MCQ.

So, in summary, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, but if I had to choose one, I would say it is not available.

The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is Question 4. 

This question is about the effect of centripetal acceleration on the air above the wing, which is related to the concept of lift generation. The correct option, "It experiences an increase in speed," is connected to the idea that the air above the wing speeds up, creating a low-pressure region, which is the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ.

However, an even more similar question would be one that directly addresses the relationship between the low-pressure region above the wing and its effect on the air. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. But among the given options, Question 4 is the closest in terms of content and intent.

**Transcript**:
He was part of America's fight
for freedom and equality. But were his enlightened principles
outweighed by participation in a greater injustice? Find out on History versus 
Thomas Jefferson. Order! Order! Hey, that’s one 
of the guys from Mt. Rushmore. Ahem. This is Thomas Jefferson, founding father of the United States
of America and primary author 
of the Declaration of Independence. The document that established 
the US as a democratic republic on the principle that everyone
is created equal. If by “everyone” you mean 
property-owning white men. At the time Jefferson was writing, one fifth of the colonies’ population 
was enslaved. Surely he couldn’t be expected
to single-handedly overturn the institution of slavery? Couldn’t he have just written 
that into the Declaration? It wasn’t that simple, Your Honor. Jefferson was one of five authors, and the document had to be ratified
by the Continental Congress. He included a clause opposing 
the slave trade, but state delegates removed it. Nevertheless, Jefferson recognized
slavery as an immoral institution and condemned it throughout his life. But Jefferson’s words never came close
to matching his actions! As Virginia’s governor, he did nothing
to change the state slave laws. And in his personal life, 
he held over 600 people in slavery. Furthermore, he believed Black people
were intellectual inferiors who, if emancipated, should return 
to their countries of origin. Frankly, there’s no argument that
Jefferson did anything significant to combat slavery. It’s true, Your Honor. But Jefferson did make 
important contributions to religious, financial,
and gender equality. He led the charge for separating
church and state, removing government funding 
for Virginia’s Anglican Church, and paving the way for our modern
understanding of religious freedom. Jefferson also drafted laws that weakened
the power of inherited wealth and pushed for the state-funded education 
of boys and girls. All valuable reforms, but you’re avoiding 
the fundamental issue here. None of this benefited enslaved people
or Indigenous Americans, and it’s ridiculous to argue
that Jefferson was pursuing equality when his policies frequently harmed
non-white groups. Policies such as authorizing the military to exterminate Indigenous communities
during the Revolutionary War. Objection! Those Northwestern tribes were
allied with the British. In peacetime, Jefferson did his best 
to avoid conflict with Native Americans and believed they could be equal 
to whites. “Could be equal”? Listen to yourself! Are you defending his attempts to forcibly
assimilate Indigenous communities? Jefferson’s recommendations
even formed the basis for the Indian Removal Act years later. Recommendations? Why not laws? Thomas Jefferson served as a diplomat
and Secretary of State before being elected as Vice President
under John Adams in 1796. A role in which he undermined
the President’s authority. Jefferson argued that states 
should have the power to overrule federal laws
they deemed unconstitutional— an argument some Southern states
would cite while seceding from the Union 70 years later. I think it’s a little unreasonable to lay 
the entire Civil War at Jefferson’s feet. Besides, his defense of states’
rights was motivated by the president’s overreaching
central government. As part of Adams’ preparations
for war with France, he signed legislation that tightened
restrictions on immigrants and limited criticism of the government. Jefferson was just trying
to protect the public. And ultimately, his efforts were 
so popular that he was elected as the next president. A dubious victory. He only won because states were allowed
to count enslaved people towards their population without giving
them voting rights. This system gave states that held people
in slavery additional voting power in the Electoral College 
until the Civil War. Be that as it may, 
Jefferson was a popular president. He worked to prevent the country
from taking on too much debt, and successfully led the US through the
Napoleonic and the Barbary Wars. Plus, he dramatically expanded 
the country’s territory through the Louisiana Purchase. Where he once again failed to stop
slavery from taking hold. I’ll remind you that President Jefferson
signed a law forbidding the importation 
of enslaved people in 1807. And yet he continued to enslave those
already on American soil— including his own flesh and blood. Pardon? Following his wife's death, Jefferson began a relationship with her
half-sister and maid, Sally Hemings. Jefferson fathered six children
with Hemings and kept the entire relationship secret, while continuing to publicly denounce
the personhood of Black Americans. Jefferson freed several members
of the Hemings family, including his children with Sally— While refusing to free anyone else. Despite enslaving over 600 people,
Jefferson only freed 10. Five during his life and five in his will— all members of the Hemings family. Even I have to admit, 
this seems indefensible. It’s true, Your Honor. Despite pursuing what he believed 
to be equality, Jefferson failed to uphold his own ideals. Ultimately, he was a man of his time— living in an economy that relied 
on exploitation and enslaved labor. That’s hardly a defense when many 
of Jefferson’s contemporaries opposed slavery and took action
to abolish it. Even if some people considered
him a great man in his time, he doesn’t have to be an icon in ours. Well, I hear Mount Rushmore has
a problematic past, too. Can we judge historical figures
by modern standards? And what responsibilities do 
powerful people have to the future? Answering these questions is all part
of putting history on trial.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is asking about a specific job that Thomas Jefferson did not hold during his lifetime, while the generated MCQs are discussing completely different topics.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 6 is the closest match. This question is asking about a specific issue related to making laws and passing them down to future generations, which is somewhat similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of its focus on a historical figure's actions and roles.

But again, I want to emphasize that none of the generated MCQs are a good match for the ground truth MCQ, and Question 6 is only the closest match by a very small margin.

**Transcript**:
He was part of America's fight
for freedom and equality. But were his enlightened principles
outweighed by participation in a greater injustice? Find out on History versus 
Thomas Jefferson. Order! Order! Hey, that’s one 
of the guys from Mt. Rushmore. Ahem. This is Thomas Jefferson, founding father of the United States
of America and primary author 
of the Declaration of Independence. The document that established 
the US as a democratic republic on the principle that everyone
is created equal. If by “everyone” you mean 
property-owning white men. At the time Jefferson was writing, one fifth of the colonies’ population 
was enslaved. Surely he couldn’t be expected
to single-handedly overturn the institution of slavery? Couldn’t he have just written 
that into the Declaration? It wasn’t that simple, Your Honor. Jefferson was one of five authors, and the document had to be ratified
by the Continental Congress. He included a clause opposing 
the slave trade, but state delegates removed it. Nevertheless, Jefferson recognized
slavery as an immoral institution and condemned it throughout his life. But Jefferson’s words never came close
to matching his actions! As Virginia’s governor, he did nothing
to change the state slave laws. And in his personal life, 
he held over 600 people in slavery. Furthermore, he believed Black people
were intellectual inferiors who, if emancipated, should return 
to their countries of origin. Frankly, there’s no argument that
Jefferson did anything significant to combat slavery. It’s true, Your Honor. But Jefferson did make 
important contributions to religious, financial,
and gender equality. He led the charge for separating
church and state, removing government funding 
for Virginia’s Anglican Church, and paving the way for our modern
understanding of religious freedom. Jefferson also drafted laws that weakened
the power of inherited wealth and pushed for the state-funded education 
of boys and girls. All valuable reforms, but you’re avoiding 
the fundamental issue here. None of this benefited enslaved people
or Indigenous Americans, and it’s ridiculous to argue
that Jefferson was pursuing equality when his policies frequently harmed
non-white groups. Policies such as authorizing the military to exterminate Indigenous communities
during the Revolutionary War. Objection! Those Northwestern tribes were
allied with the British. In peacetime, Jefferson did his best 
to avoid conflict with Native Americans and believed they could be equal 
to whites. “Could be equal”? Listen to yourself! Are you defending his attempts to forcibly
assimilate Indigenous communities? Jefferson’s recommendations
even formed the basis for the Indian Removal Act years later. Recommendations? Why not laws? Thomas Jefferson served as a diplomat
and Secretary of State before being elected as Vice President
under John Adams in 1796. A role in which he undermined
the President’s authority. Jefferson argued that states 
should have the power to overrule federal laws
they deemed unconstitutional— an argument some Southern states
would cite while seceding from the Union 70 years later. I think it’s a little unreasonable to lay 
the entire Civil War at Jefferson’s feet. Besides, his defense of states’
rights was motivated by the president’s overreaching
central government. As part of Adams’ preparations
for war with France, he signed legislation that tightened
restrictions on immigrants and limited criticism of the government. Jefferson was just trying
to protect the public. And ultimately, his efforts were 
so popular that he was elected as the next president. A dubious victory. He only won because states were allowed
to count enslaved people towards their population without giving
them voting rights. This system gave states that held people
in slavery additional voting power in the Electoral College 
until the Civil War. Be that as it may, 
Jefferson was a popular president. He worked to prevent the country
from taking on too much debt, and successfully led the US through the
Napoleonic and the Barbary Wars. Plus, he dramatically expanded 
the country’s territory through the Louisiana Purchase. Where he once again failed to stop
slavery from taking hold. I’ll remind you that President Jefferson
signed a law forbidding the importation 
of enslaved people in 1807. And yet he continued to enslave those
already on American soil— including his own flesh and blood. Pardon? Following his wife's death, Jefferson began a relationship with her
half-sister and maid, Sally Hemings. Jefferson fathered six children
with Hemings and kept the entire relationship secret, while continuing to publicly denounce
the personhood of Black Americans. Jefferson freed several members
of the Hemings family, including his children with Sally— While refusing to free anyone else. Despite enslaving over 600 people,
Jefferson only freed 10. Five during his life and five in his will— all members of the Hemings family. Even I have to admit, 
this seems indefensible. It’s true, Your Honor. Despite pursuing what he believed 
to be equality, Jefferson failed to uphold his own ideals. Ultimately, he was a man of his time— living in an economy that relied 
on exploitation and enslaved labor. That’s hardly a defense when many 
of Jefferson’s contemporaries opposed slavery and took action
to abolish it. Even if some people considered
him a great man in his time, he doesn’t have to be an icon in ours. Well, I hear Mount Rushmore has
a problematic past, too. Can we judge historical figures
by modern standards? And what responsibilities do 
powerful people have to the future? Answering these questions is all part
of putting history on trial.

**Transcript**:
While we often talk about puberty’s
effect on the body, what gets overlooked are the fascinating
changes that happen in the brain. I’ve been sent here to talk 
to you about puberty. Any questions? During puberty, your reproductive organs
grow and mature. Any questions? This ripening allows you to become
a sexually mature adult. There are so many other changes 
to your body that puberty can seem almost magical. I think I'll take it from here. Puberty, in fact, 
begins in the brain. At some point, usually 
between the ages of 9 and 14, puberty is triggered when a region 
known as the hypothalamus releases waves of a specialized hormone. As convenient as it would be to go 
to sleep a child and wake up an adult, this maturation is slow, and puberty lasts as long as 4 to 5 years. And during this extended process, the brain undergoes 
its own transformation, thanks to two of puberty’s key players—
estrogen and testosterone. Produced in the developing 
testes and ovaries, these hormones hitch a ride 
to the brain via the bloodstream. Once there, they interact 
with receptors on neurons, changing the way the individual cells 
work and function by making them more or less excitable, 
altering their growth, or reshaping their connections. Cumulatively, this can change how
you feel, think, and behave. For example, hormones remodel 
and develop the limbic system, a collection of brain regions responsible
for emotional behavior. Research in animal models suggests 
that the amygdala undergoes changes in size and connectivity during puberty. The amygdala’s function is wide-ranging, from detecting threats 
in your environment, to helping you recognize emotions 
in your friend’s faces. Its development allows you to better
connect with your peers, while priming your brain 
for learning and discovery. Likewise, puberty organizes
and restructures the nucleus accumbens involved in reward and sensation-seeking. Activity in this dopamine
hub is thought to drive the pleasurable sensations we feel when
doing rewarding activities, like spending time with friends 
or having new experiences. Several studies have found that as hormone levels increase
through puberty, so does the response 
of the nucleus accumbens. As a result, exploration and social
engagement may feel that much more important 
during adolescence. As these emotion and reward
centers rapidly develop, their connections with higher cortical
brain regions tend to do so on an extended timeline. These cortical regions, which help impose 
emotional regulation and impulse control, continue to grow well past puberty,
into your 20s. While teens are often unfairly stereotyped
as rash or impulsive, research reveals a more complex story. Teens are just as capable as adults 
of making thoughtful decisions when given the time and space. It’s only during high stress 
or in the heat of the moment that teens may find it more
difficult to manage emotions. Further, this lengthy cortical development
allows adolescent brains to remain adaptable as they learn
and grow in new situations, form their identities, and build 
the skill sets needed for adulthood. For all we know about the effects
of puberty on the brain, there remain many unanswered questions. What sets off the initial puberty
signal in the brain? Why is the average onset 
of puberty shifting earlier? And, while hormones may seem powerful,
they may not be the full story. Experiences you have during adolescence
may be just as influential as hormones in shaping and maturing
the developing brain. So while all these physical and mental
changes can make you feel as if puberty is in control, you have more power than you think. The everyday choices you make, from learning new skills, to being 
a good friend, to setting boundaries, ultimately steer the path 
of who you are and will become. Any questions?

**Transcript**:
While we often talk about puberty’s
effect on the body, what gets overlooked are the fascinating
changes that happen in the brain. I’ve been sent here to talk 
to you about puberty. Any questions? During puberty, your reproductive organs
grow and mature. Any questions? This ripening allows you to become
a sexually mature adult. There are so many other changes 
to your body that puberty can seem almost magical. I think I'll take it from here. Puberty, in fact, 
begins in the brain. At some point, usually 
between the ages of 9 and 14, puberty is triggered when a region 
known as the hypothalamus releases waves of a specialized hormone. As convenient as it would be to go 
to sleep a child and wake up an adult, this maturation is slow, and puberty lasts as long as 4 to 5 years. And during this extended process, the brain undergoes 
its own transformation, thanks to two of puberty’s key players—
estrogen and testosterone. Produced in the developing 
testes and ovaries, these hormones hitch a ride 
to the brain via the bloodstream. Once there, they interact 
with receptors on neurons, changing the way the individual cells 
work and function by making them more or less excitable, 
altering their growth, or reshaping their connections. Cumulatively, this can change how
you feel, think, and behave. For example, hormones remodel 
and develop the limbic system, a collection of brain regions responsible
for emotional behavior. Research in animal models suggests 
that the amygdala undergoes changes in size and connectivity during puberty. The amygdala’s function is wide-ranging, from detecting threats 
in your environment, to helping you recognize emotions 
in your friend’s faces. Its development allows you to better
connect with your peers, while priming your brain 
for learning and discovery. Likewise, puberty organizes
and restructures the nucleus accumbens involved in reward and sensation-seeking. Activity in this dopamine
hub is thought to drive the pleasurable sensations we feel when
doing rewarding activities, like spending time with friends 
or having new experiences. Several studies have found that as hormone levels increase
through puberty, so does the response 
of the nucleus accumbens. As a result, exploration and social
engagement may feel that much more important 
during adolescence. As these emotion and reward
centers rapidly develop, their connections with higher cortical
brain regions tend to do so on an extended timeline. These cortical regions, which help impose 
emotional regulation and impulse control, continue to grow well past puberty,
into your 20s. While teens are often unfairly stereotyped
as rash or impulsive, research reveals a more complex story. Teens are just as capable as adults 
of making thoughtful decisions when given the time and space. It’s only during high stress 
or in the heat of the moment that teens may find it more
difficult to manage emotions. Further, this lengthy cortical development
allows adolescent brains to remain adaptable as they learn
and grow in new situations, form their identities, and build 
the skill sets needed for adulthood. For all we know about the effects
of puberty on the brain, there remain many unanswered questions. What sets off the initial puberty
signal in the brain? Why is the average onset 
of puberty shifting earlier? And, while hormones may seem powerful,
they may not be the full story. Experiences you have during adolescence
may be just as influential as hormones in shaping and maturing
the developing brain. So while all these physical and mental
changes can make you feel as if puberty is in control, you have more power than you think. The everyday choices you make, from learning new skills, to being 
a good friend, to setting boundaries, ultimately steer the path 
of who you are and will become. Any questions?

**Transcript**:
As soon as Pharaoh Khufu ascended
the throne circa 2575 BCE, work on his eternal resting place began. The structure’s architect, Hemiunu, determined he would need 20 years
to finish the royal tomb. But what he could not predict was
that this monument would remain the world’s tallest manmade structure
for over 3,800 years. To construct the Great Pyramid, Hemiunu would need to dig 
a 6-and-a-half-kilometer canal, quarry enormous amounts of limestone
and granite, and use kilometers of rope 
to pull stones into place. Today, there are still vigorous debates
about the exact methods the Egyptians employed. But we do know that first Hemiunu
needed a construction site. The Egyptians spoke of death 
as going west like the setting sun, and the Nile’s west bank had 
a plateau of bedrock that could support the pyramid 
better than shifting sand. In a brilliant timesaving move, masons carved the plateau itself 
to look like the stones used for the rest of the pyramid. With this level foundation in place,
construction could begin. The project called for a staggering
25,000 workers, but fortunately, Hemiunu had
an established labor supply. Egyptians were required to perform 
manual labor for the government throughout the year, and citizens from across the country
came to contribute. Workers performed a wide range
of tasks, from crafting tools and clothes
to administrative work to back-breaking manual labor. But contrary to popular belief, 
these workers were not enslaved people. In fact, these citizens were housed
and fed with rations better than the average Egyptian 
could afford. To complete the project in 20 years, one block of stone would need 
to be quarried, transported, and pushed into place 
every 3 minutes, 365 days a year. Workers averaged 10-hour days, hauling
limestone from two different quarries. One was close to the site, but its fossil-lined yellow stone
was deemed suitable only for the pyramid’s interior. Stones for the outside were hauled 
from roughly 13 kilometers away, using 9-meter long sleds 
made from giant cedar trunks. When mined from the ground, limestone is soft and splits easily
into straight lines. But after air exposure it hardens, requiring wooden mallets and copper
chisels to shape. The pyramid used over 2 million stones,
each weighing up to 80 tons. And there was no room for error
in how they were shaped. Even the smallest inaccuracy at the bottom
of the pyramid could result in a catastrophic failure at the top. Researchers know where the materials used
to build the pyramids came from and how they were transported, but the actual construction process
remains mysterious. Most experts agree that limestone ramps
were used to move the stones into place, but there are many theories on the number
of ramps and their locations. And the pyramid’s exterior
is just half the story. Since death could come
for the pharaoh at any time, Hemiunu always needed an accessible
burial chamber at the ready, so three separate burial chambers
were built during construction. The last of these, 
known as the King’s Chamber, is a spacious granite room
with a soaring ceiling, located at the heart of the pyramid. it lay on top of an 8.5-meter high
passageway called the Grand Gallery, which may have been used 
as an ancient freight elevator to move granite up the pyramid’s interior. Granite was used for all 
the pyramid’s support beams. Much stronger than limestone, 
but extremely difficult to shape, workers used dolerite rocks as hammers
to slowly quarry the stone. To ensure the granite beams would be ready
when he needed them, Hemiunu dispatched 500 workers 
in the project’s first year so that the material would be ready
12 years later. Five stories of granite sit
atop the King’s Chamber, preventing the pyramid 
from collapsing in on itself. Once complete, the entire structure
was encased with white limestone, polished with sand and stone
until it gleamed. Finally, a capstone was placed on top. Covered with electrum 
and glimmering like gold, this peak shined like
a second sun over all of Egypt. This video was made possible with support

**Transcript**:
As soon as Pharaoh Khufu ascended
the throne circa 2575 BCE, work on his eternal resting place began. The structure’s architect, Hemiunu, determined he would need 20 years
to finish the royal tomb. But what he could not predict was
that this monument would remain the world’s tallest manmade structure
for over 3,800 years. To construct the Great Pyramid, Hemiunu would need to dig 
a 6-and-a-half-kilometer canal, quarry enormous amounts of limestone
and granite, and use kilometers of rope 
to pull stones into place. Today, there are still vigorous debates
about the exact methods the Egyptians employed. But we do know that first Hemiunu
needed a construction site. The Egyptians spoke of death 
as going west like the setting sun, and the Nile’s west bank had 
a plateau of bedrock that could support the pyramid 
better than shifting sand. In a brilliant timesaving move, masons carved the plateau itself 
to look like the stones used for the rest of the pyramid. With this level foundation in place,
construction could begin. The project called for a staggering
25,000 workers, but fortunately, Hemiunu had
an established labor supply. Egyptians were required to perform 
manual labor for the government throughout the year, and citizens from across the country
came to contribute. Workers performed a wide range
of tasks, from crafting tools and clothes
to administrative work to back-breaking manual labor. But contrary to popular belief, 
these workers were not enslaved people. In fact, these citizens were housed
and fed with rations better than the average Egyptian 
could afford. To complete the project in 20 years, one block of stone would need 
to be quarried, transported, and pushed into place 
every 3 minutes, 365 days a year. Workers averaged 10-hour days, hauling
limestone from two different quarries. One was close to the site, but its fossil-lined yellow stone
was deemed suitable only for the pyramid’s interior. Stones for the outside were hauled 
from roughly 13 kilometers away, using 9-meter long sleds 
made from giant cedar trunks. When mined from the ground, limestone is soft and splits easily
into straight lines. But after air exposure it hardens, requiring wooden mallets and copper
chisels to shape. The pyramid used over 2 million stones,
each weighing up to 80 tons. And there was no room for error
in how they were shaped. Even the smallest inaccuracy at the bottom
of the pyramid could result in a catastrophic failure at the top. Researchers know where the materials used
to build the pyramids came from and how they were transported, but the actual construction process
remains mysterious. Most experts agree that limestone ramps
were used to move the stones into place, but there are many theories on the number
of ramps and their locations. And the pyramid’s exterior
is just half the story. Since death could come
for the pharaoh at any time, Hemiunu always needed an accessible
burial chamber at the ready, so three separate burial chambers
were built during construction. The last of these, 
known as the King’s Chamber, is a spacious granite room
with a soaring ceiling, located at the heart of the pyramid. it lay on top of an 8.5-meter high
passageway called the Grand Gallery, which may have been used 
as an ancient freight elevator to move granite up the pyramid’s interior. Granite was used for all 
the pyramid’s support beams. Much stronger than limestone, 
but extremely difficult to shape, workers used dolerite rocks as hammers
to slowly quarry the stone. To ensure the granite beams would be ready
when he needed them, Hemiunu dispatched 500 workers 
in the project’s first year so that the material would be ready
12 years later. Five stories of granite sit
atop the King’s Chamber, preventing the pyramid 
from collapsing in on itself. Once complete, the entire structure
was encased with white limestone, polished with sand and stone
until it gleamed. Finally, a capstone was placed on top. Covered with electrum 
and glimmering like gold, this peak shined like
a second sun over all of Egypt. This video was made possible with support

**Transcript**:
In the wealthiest circles 
of Victorian England, bizarre fads ran rampant. But perhaps none was as strange
as the tapeworm diet, in which dieters swallowed
an unhatched tapeworm and let it grow inside them 
by consuming undigested meals. Obviously, this is an exceptionally
dangerous and unhealthy way to manage your weight. However, while modern fad diets
aren't usually this extreme, they do promise similar results;
specifically, losing weight fast. So, are there any fast diets that do work? And are any of them 
actually healthy for you? To answer these questions, 
let’s consider a thought experiment. Sam and Felix are identical twins
both planning to go on a diet. They share the same height, weight,
fat and muscle mass. But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,
while Felix wants to go fast. Sam's plan is to gradually decrease
his calorie intake and increase his regular exercise. With less energy coming in
and more being expended, he’s creating an energy deficit
inside his body. To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking 
down his emergency glucose supply, stored in the liver 
in the form of glycogen. Then, after 4 to 6 hours, 
his body starts burning fat cells as a major energy source. This process releases lipid droplets which are broken down into compounds
that float through the bloodstream and provide energy to organs and tissues. Felix aims to create 
a similar energy deficit by dramatically cutting 
his calorie intake. Unlike Sam, 
who’s still eating smaller meals, Felix is eating almost nothing. And his body responds by going
into a starvation response. Felix’s body breaks down his entire store
of emergency glucose in just 18 hours. And while Sam steadily replenishes
glycogen with every healthy meal, Felix’s low-calorie diet does not. Desperate for energy, his body starts
breaking down other materials, including his muscles. Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise 
is maintaining his muscle mass. This means he’ll use more energy
both during exercise and at rest, making it easier for him to lose weight. Felix, on the other hand,
is losing muscle mass and burning fewer calories than ever
for his body's basic functions, making weight loss even more difficult. Despite all this, there’s one element
of Felix’s fast diet that might make him think
he's on the right track. Every gram of glycogen is bound
to several grams of water. This can add up to two kilograms
of water weight, all of which is lost 
when the glycogen is depleted. For Felix, this might seem like
he’s losing weight fast. But as soon as he stops starving himself, his body will replenish its glycogen store
and regain that weight. Clearly, Felix’s plan does
more harm than good, but extreme calorie reduction diets
aren’t the only regimens promising to shed weight fast. Plans called “detoxification diets” 
either promote or restrict certain foods to provide specific nutrients
in high quantities. These can be useful for addressing
some nutritional problems, but they’re far too specific 
to be used as general cure-alls. For example, for a person 
with low vitamin A, a juice diet might be helpful. But for someone high in vitamin A,
juicing could be disastrous. And regardless of personal nutrition, maintaining a juice diet 
over multiple weeks is likely to compromise the immune system due to a lack of essential fats
and proteins. Therein lies the problem 
with all these fast-moving diets— whether you’re cutting calories
or food groups, extreme diets are a shock to your system. There are well-established rates 
of healthy weight loss motivated by both diet and exercise that account for genetic and medical
differences. And staying on those timelines requires 
a dietary lifestyle that’s sustainable. In fact, some of the worst side effects
of extreme diets are rarely discussed since so few people
stick with them, it also bears mentioning that many
societies have unhealthy relationships with weight, and people are often pressured to diet for
reasons other than health or happiness. So rather than trying to lose weight fast, we should all be taking our time 
to figure out what the healthiest lifestyle
is for ourselves.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically a philosophical discussion about justice, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of weight loss and fasting.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 3 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate answer would be that there is no generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs seem to be from a different topic or context, and none of them address the topic of weight loss or fasting.

Index: No match (or Question 3, but with a strong caveat that the content and intent are different)

**Transcript**:
In the wealthiest circles 
of Victorian England, bizarre fads ran rampant. But perhaps none was as strange
as the tapeworm diet, in which dieters swallowed
an unhatched tapeworm and let it grow inside them 
by consuming undigested meals. Obviously, this is an exceptionally
dangerous and unhealthy way to manage your weight. However, while modern fad diets
aren't usually this extreme, they do promise similar results;
specifically, losing weight fast. So, are there any fast diets that do work? And are any of them 
actually healthy for you? To answer these questions, 
let’s consider a thought experiment. Sam and Felix are identical twins
both planning to go on a diet. They share the same height, weight,
fat and muscle mass. But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,
while Felix wants to go fast. Sam's plan is to gradually decrease
his calorie intake and increase his regular exercise. With less energy coming in
and more being expended, he’s creating an energy deficit
inside his body. To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking 
down his emergency glucose supply, stored in the liver 
in the form of glycogen. Then, after 4 to 6 hours, 
his body starts burning fat cells as a major energy source. This process releases lipid droplets which are broken down into compounds
that float through the bloodstream and provide energy to organs and tissues. Felix aims to create 
a similar energy deficit by dramatically cutting 
his calorie intake. Unlike Sam, 
who’s still eating smaller meals, Felix is eating almost nothing. And his body responds by going
into a starvation response. Felix’s body breaks down his entire store
of emergency glucose in just 18 hours. And while Sam steadily replenishes
glycogen with every healthy meal, Felix’s low-calorie diet does not. Desperate for energy, his body starts
breaking down other materials, including his muscles. Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise 
is maintaining his muscle mass. This means he’ll use more energy
both during exercise and at rest, making it easier for him to lose weight. Felix, on the other hand,
is losing muscle mass and burning fewer calories than ever
for his body's basic functions, making weight loss even more difficult. Despite all this, there’s one element
of Felix’s fast diet that might make him think
he's on the right track. Every gram of glycogen is bound
to several grams of water. This can add up to two kilograms
of water weight, all of which is lost 
when the glycogen is depleted. For Felix, this might seem like
he’s losing weight fast. But as soon as he stops starving himself, his body will replenish its glycogen store
and regain that weight. Clearly, Felix’s plan does
more harm than good, but extreme calorie reduction diets
aren’t the only regimens promising to shed weight fast. Plans called “detoxification diets” 
either promote or restrict certain foods to provide specific nutrients
in high quantities. These can be useful for addressing
some nutritional problems, but they’re far too specific 
to be used as general cure-alls. For example, for a person 
with low vitamin A, a juice diet might be helpful. But for someone high in vitamin A,
juicing could be disastrous. And regardless of personal nutrition, maintaining a juice diet 
over multiple weeks is likely to compromise the immune system due to a lack of essential fats
and proteins. Therein lies the problem 
with all these fast-moving diets— whether you’re cutting calories
or food groups, extreme diets are a shock to your system. There are well-established rates 
of healthy weight loss motivated by both diet and exercise that account for genetic and medical
differences. And staying on those timelines requires 
a dietary lifestyle that’s sustainable. In fact, some of the worst side effects
of extreme diets are rarely discussed since so few people
stick with them, it also bears mentioning that many
societies have unhealthy relationships with weight, and people are often pressured to diet for
reasons other than health or happiness. So rather than trying to lose weight fast, we should all be taking our time 
to figure out what the healthiest lifestyle
is for ourselves.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to a different topic, specifically philosophy and ethics, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the topic of diet and nutrition.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar in terms of question structure and format, I would choose Question 5, but only because it has a similar format of asking about a specific concept and providing options. However, please note that the content and intent of Question 5 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate answer would be that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of generated MCQs that are specific to the topic of diet and nutrition would be needed to find a match.

If you'd like, I can try to generate a new set of MCQs that are specific to the topic of diet and nutrition, and then try to find a match.

**Transcript**:
It was dark when two mysterious, 
shrouded figures appeared in the hillside village. The strangers knocked on every door 
in town, asking for food and shelter. But, again and again, 
they were turned away. Soon, there was just one door left: that of a small, thatched shack. An elderly couple, Baucis and Philemon,
answered the thunderous knock. Although there was something
off about these visitors, it was in the pair’s nature
to care for those in need. Philemon invited them to rest, and the cottage flooded with warmth
as Baucis teased the fire back to life. When they were young, Baucis and Philemon
had fallen in love, married, 
and settled in the humble cottage. Decades later, their home
was still standing— and they were more devoted
to each other than ever. The strangers watched intently as Baucis
nestled twigs under a battered pot filled with vegetables. The couple could rarely afford meat,
but in honor of their guests, Philemon cut strips from an aging shank
for the stew. They made cheerful conversation 
and offered their visitors hot baths. Baucis used a chip of broken clay 
to balance the wobbly table’s legs and rubbed its surface with mint 
until it smelled sweet and fresh. Weaving around each other with care, the couple transformed 
what they had into a feast. Soon, the tabletop overflowed with food
and the last of their sweet wine. Privately, Baucis and Philemon worried 
that their provisions would run out. Yet, as the night wore on, and their strange guests 
took hearty gulps of wine, the clay vessel never ran dry. The couple, at first relieved, 
grew terrified. Their guests weren’t humble peasants
traveling the countryside. They were almost certainly gods 
in disguise— but which gods, 
they didn’t know. Panicked that their preparations
were inadequate, Baucis and Philemon searched 
for another offering. The only precious thing left was 
the goose that guarded their home. The couple repeatedly lunged
after the bird, but they were too worn out for the chase. So, they prepared to receive
the wrath of the gods. Their guests rose up, 
shedding their rags and mortal masks. Looming before them was Zeus, 
the storm-brewing ruler of the gods, and his son, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger
who shepherded mortals to the underworld. The gods told the old couple that, 
unlike the other townspeople, they had shown true xenia, 
or loving hospitality to strangers. They alone had passed the test. The gods commanded the couple
to follow them, and the group ascended
the nearest mountain. Nearing the summit, 
Baucis and Philemon looked back— but were shocked to see a murky swamp
where their village stood just moments before. As punishment for refusing
to shelter the gods, Zeus and Hermes had cast 
the townspeople underwater, leaving only their hosts’ home intact, Recalling their friends and neighbors, Baucis and Philemon couldn’t hide
their terror and mournful tears, even as their house transformed below. It grew larger and sprouted
marble pillars and steps. Legends etched themselves
onto its grand doors. Their rickety cottage had metamorphosed
into a gleaming temple for the gods. Hermes commended the couple and gently
asked if there was anything they desired. After a brief discussion, Philemon
requested that he and Baucis be permitted to care for the new temple. And he asked if, when their time came, 
they could die together, so neither would have to face life
without the other. Tending to the temple and one another, 
they lived many more years. Until, one day, Baucis noticed leaves
fluttering from her husband’s hands and looked down to find 
her own skin hardening. They embraced, becoming rooted in place. Vines wound around their legs 
and canopies flourished overhead. They bid each other a loving,
last farewell as humans. And where Baucis and Philemon 
had just stood, bent with age, there towered a linden and an oak tree, their branches intertwined for eternity.

**Transcript**:
It was dark when two mysterious, 
shrouded figures appeared in the hillside village. The strangers knocked on every door 
in town, asking for food and shelter. But, again and again, 
they were turned away. Soon, there was just one door left: that of a small, thatched shack. An elderly couple, Baucis and Philemon,
answered the thunderous knock. Although there was something
off about these visitors, it was in the pair’s nature
to care for those in need. Philemon invited them to rest, and the cottage flooded with warmth
as Baucis teased the fire back to life. When they were young, Baucis and Philemon
had fallen in love, married, 
and settled in the humble cottage. Decades later, their home
was still standing— and they were more devoted
to each other than ever. The strangers watched intently as Baucis
nestled twigs under a battered pot filled with vegetables. The couple could rarely afford meat,
but in honor of their guests, Philemon cut strips from an aging shank
for the stew. They made cheerful conversation 
and offered their visitors hot baths. Baucis used a chip of broken clay 
to balance the wobbly table’s legs and rubbed its surface with mint 
until it smelled sweet and fresh. Weaving around each other with care, the couple transformed 
what they had into a feast. Soon, the tabletop overflowed with food
and the last of their sweet wine. Privately, Baucis and Philemon worried 
that their provisions would run out. Yet, as the night wore on, and their strange guests 
took hearty gulps of wine, the clay vessel never ran dry. The couple, at first relieved, 
grew terrified. Their guests weren’t humble peasants
traveling the countryside. They were almost certainly gods 
in disguise— but which gods, 
they didn’t know. Panicked that their preparations
were inadequate, Baucis and Philemon searched 
for another offering. The only precious thing left was 
the goose that guarded their home. The couple repeatedly lunged
after the bird, but they were too worn out for the chase. So, they prepared to receive
the wrath of the gods. Their guests rose up, 
shedding their rags and mortal masks. Looming before them was Zeus, 
the storm-brewing ruler of the gods, and his son, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger
who shepherded mortals to the underworld. The gods told the old couple that, 
unlike the other townspeople, they had shown true xenia, 
or loving hospitality to strangers. They alone had passed the test. The gods commanded the couple
to follow them, and the group ascended
the nearest mountain. Nearing the summit, 
Baucis and Philemon looked back— but were shocked to see a murky swamp
where their village stood just moments before. As punishment for refusing
to shelter the gods, Zeus and Hermes had cast 
the townspeople underwater, leaving only their hosts’ home intact, Recalling their friends and neighbors, Baucis and Philemon couldn’t hide
their terror and mournful tears, even as their house transformed below. It grew larger and sprouted
marble pillars and steps. Legends etched themselves
onto its grand doors. Their rickety cottage had metamorphosed
into a gleaming temple for the gods. Hermes commended the couple and gently
asked if there was anything they desired. After a brief discussion, Philemon
requested that he and Baucis be permitted to care for the new temple. And he asked if, when their time came, 
they could die together, so neither would have to face life
without the other. Tending to the temple and one another, 
they lived many more years. Until, one day, Baucis noticed leaves
fluttering from her husband’s hands and looked down to find 
her own skin hardening. They embraced, becoming rooted in place. Vines wound around their legs 
and canopies flourished overhead. They bid each other a loving,
last farewell as humans. And where Baucis and Philemon 
had just stood, bent with age, there towered a linden and an oak tree, their branches intertwined for eternity.

**Transcript**:
What's the most important century
in human history? Some might argue it’s a period 
of extensive military campaigning, like Alexander the Great’s 
in the 300s BCE, which reshaped political
and cultural borders. Others might cite the emergence 
of a major religion, such as Islam in the 7th century, which codified and spread values
across such borders. Or perhaps it’s the Industrial Revolution
of the 1700s that transformed global commerce and redefined humanity's relationship
with labor. Whatever the answer, it seems like 
any century vying for that top spot is at a moment of great change— when the actions of our ancestors shifted
humanity’s trajectory for centuries to come. So if this is our metric, 
is it possible that right now— this century— 
is the most important one yet? The 21st century has already proven to be
a period of rapid technological growth. Phones and computers have accelerated
the pace of life. And we’re likely on the cusp of developing
new transformative technologies, like advanced artificial intelligence, that could entirely change 
the way people live. Meanwhile, many technologies 
we already have contribute to humanity’s unprecedented 
levels of existential risk— that’s the risk of our
species going extinct or experiencing some kind of disaster
that permanently limits humanity’s ability to grow and thrive. The invention of the atomic bomb marked
a major rise in existential risk, and since then we’ve only increased
the odds against us. It’s profoundly difficult
to estimate the odds of an existential collapse 
occurring this century. Very rough guesses put the risk 
of existential catastrophe due to nuclear winter and climate change
at around 0.1%, with the odds of a pandemic causing
the same kind of collapse at a frightening 3%. Given that any of these disasters could 
mean the end of life as we know it, these aren’t exactly small figures, And it’s possible this century could see
the rise of new technologies that introduce more existential risks. AI experts have a wide range 
of estimates regarding when artificial general intelligence
will emerge, but according to some surveys,
many believe it could happen this century. Currently, we have relatively narrow forms
of artificial intelligence, which are designed to do specific tasks 
like play chess or recognize faces. Even narrow AIs that do creative work are
limited to their singular specialty. But artificial general intelligences,
or AGIs, would be able to adapt to and
perform any number of tasks, quickly outpacing 
their human counterparts. There are a huge variety of guesses
about what AGI could look like, and what it would mean
for humanity to share the Earth with another sentient entity. AGIs might help us achieve our goals, they might regard us as inconsequential, or, they might see us as an obstacle
to swiftly remove. So in terms of existential risk, it's imperative the values of this new
technology align with our own. This is an incredibly difficult
philosophical and engineering challenge that will require a lot 
of delicate, thoughtful work. Yet, even if we succeed, AGI could still
lead to another complicated outcome. Let’s imagine an AGI emerges 
with deep respect for human life and a desire to solve
all humanity’s troubles. But to avoid becoming misaligned, it's been developed to be incredibly
rigid about its beliefs. If these machines became 
the dominant power on Earth, their strict values might
become hegemonic, locking humanity into one ideology that
would be incredibly resistant to change. History has taught us that
no matter how enlightened a civilization thinks they are, they are rarely up to the moral standards
of later generations. And this kind of value lock in
could permanently distort or constrain humanity’s moral growth. There's a ton of uncertainty around AGI, and it’s profoundly difficult to predict
how any existential risks will play out over the next century. It’s also possible that new, 
more pressing concerns might render these risks moot. But even if we can't definitively say that
ours is the most important century, it still seems like the decisions 
we make might have a major impact on humanity’s future. So maybe we should all live 
like the future depends on us— because actually, it just might.

**Transcript**:
What's the most important century
in human history? Some might argue it’s a period 
of extensive military campaigning, like Alexander the Great’s 
in the 300s BCE, which reshaped political
and cultural borders. Others might cite the emergence 
of a major religion, such as Islam in the 7th century, which codified and spread values
across such borders. Or perhaps it’s the Industrial Revolution
of the 1700s that transformed global commerce and redefined humanity's relationship
with labor. Whatever the answer, it seems like 
any century vying for that top spot is at a moment of great change— when the actions of our ancestors shifted
humanity’s trajectory for centuries to come. So if this is our metric, 
is it possible that right now— this century— 
is the most important one yet? The 21st century has already proven to be
a period of rapid technological growth. Phones and computers have accelerated
the pace of life. And we’re likely on the cusp of developing
new transformative technologies, like advanced artificial intelligence, that could entirely change 
the way people live. Meanwhile, many technologies 
we already have contribute to humanity’s unprecedented 
levels of existential risk— that’s the risk of our
species going extinct or experiencing some kind of disaster
that permanently limits humanity’s ability to grow and thrive. The invention of the atomic bomb marked
a major rise in existential risk, and since then we’ve only increased
the odds against us. It’s profoundly difficult
to estimate the odds of an existential collapse 
occurring this century. Very rough guesses put the risk 
of existential catastrophe due to nuclear winter and climate change
at around 0.1%, with the odds of a pandemic causing
the same kind of collapse at a frightening 3%. Given that any of these disasters could 
mean the end of life as we know it, these aren’t exactly small figures, And it’s possible this century could see
the rise of new technologies that introduce more existential risks. AI experts have a wide range 
of estimates regarding when artificial general intelligence
will emerge, but according to some surveys,
many believe it could happen this century. Currently, we have relatively narrow forms
of artificial intelligence, which are designed to do specific tasks 
like play chess or recognize faces. Even narrow AIs that do creative work are
limited to their singular specialty. But artificial general intelligences,
or AGIs, would be able to adapt to and
perform any number of tasks, quickly outpacing 
their human counterparts. There are a huge variety of guesses
about what AGI could look like, and what it would mean
for humanity to share the Earth with another sentient entity. AGIs might help us achieve our goals, they might regard us as inconsequential, or, they might see us as an obstacle
to swiftly remove. So in terms of existential risk, it's imperative the values of this new
technology align with our own. This is an incredibly difficult
philosophical and engineering challenge that will require a lot 
of delicate, thoughtful work. Yet, even if we succeed, AGI could still
lead to another complicated outcome. Let’s imagine an AGI emerges 
with deep respect for human life and a desire to solve
all humanity’s troubles. But to avoid becoming misaligned, it's been developed to be incredibly
rigid about its beliefs. If these machines became 
the dominant power on Earth, their strict values might
become hegemonic, locking humanity into one ideology that
would be incredibly resistant to change. History has taught us that
no matter how enlightened a civilization thinks they are, they are rarely up to the moral standards
of later generations. And this kind of value lock in
could permanently distort or constrain humanity’s moral growth. There's a ton of uncertainty around AGI, and it’s profoundly difficult to predict
how any existential risks will play out over the next century. It’s also possible that new, 
more pressing concerns might render these risks moot. But even if we can't definitively say that
ours is the most important century, it still seems like the decisions 
we make might have a major impact on humanity’s future. So maybe we should all live 
like the future depends on us— because actually, it just might.

In this south Texas clearing, an ancient tale that ties the members 
of four species together is unfurling. The first involved is our soon-to-be
queen leafcutter ant. The second is this fungus, a piece of
which she scoops into her mouth pocket. The third are these tiny cockroaches,
which nestle under her wings. And the fourth is the one
that threatens them all. But it’ll reveal itself later. In a flapping-wing frenzy,
our ant takes to the sky. This is the only chance
she’ll have to mate, so she stores as much sperm as she can
from the males she meets in midair. After dropping to the ground, 
she sheds her wings and begins digging. She excavates a tunnel and a side chamber,
then plugs the entrance, sealing herself in. There, she regurgitates the fungus. This pile of puke will form 
the bedrock of her kingdom. Over the following weeks, in between laying eggs 
and consuming the infertile ones, she tends to her developing fungal garden, fertilizing it with feces. Finally, her first offspring surge
forth and establish a rhythm. Soldiers guard the nest while foragers
set off to find tender foliage. The larger foragers, 
equipped with powerful mandibles, anchor themselves on leaves 
and chomp away in a wide arcs. Holding these pieces aloft, which can weigh more than eight times
their body mass, the workers march back to the nest. Meanwhile, the colony’s smallest ants
clean the leaf fragments of debris and pathogens. But the colony doesn’t eat these morsels. Instead, the ants use them
to sustain their fungus, which, in turn, sustains the colony. More than 10 million years ago, 
leafcutter ants domesticated fungus. Like many of our crops, 
the fungus they farm is genetically distinct 
from its wild relatives and can no longer survive
without their help. Reciprocally, the fungus provides 
the ants with an essential amino acid and digestive enzymes they’ve lost. Once the workers return 
to the nest with their spoils, they crush up the leaves, making their offerings easier 
for the fungus to consume. Foragers work tirelessly 
over the following months. They create thousands of trails,
stretching hundreds of meters. All of them are perfumed 
with the ants’ pheromones and constantly cleaned 
to function as efficient highways. Meanwhile, the queen lays thousands
of eggs every day and is tended to by members
of her entourage, which nourish her 
with the large, infertile eggs they lay. Among enclosures containing
garbage and growing larvae, workers tend fungal gardens in various
chambers throughout the colony. They prune bits of the fungus 
to stimulate growth and strategically open and close
surface tunnels, controlling the humidity. But ants aren't the only
animals down here. Tiny cockroaches like those that
originally crept under the queen’s wings feed opportunistically off the fungus. Each could fit on the head of a Q-Tip. They hitch rides on soon-to-be queens, and make their way 
to more established colonies. Inside the leafcutter nest,
they’re undercover: closely mimicking the ants’
signature scent, they frolic and feed 
in the fungal gardens, mostly undetected. And here’s where this tale’s antagonist
rears its virulent fruiting body: our elusive fourth character is a 
parasitic micro-fungus called Escovopsis. If left unchecked, it would destroy 
the fungal gardens and the ants and the cockroaches that depend on them. The leafcutters mount 
a barrage of defenses. They rigorously weed Escovopsis out and partner up with different
microorganisms like yeasts and bacteria to stunt its growth. Eventually, the leafcutter colony covers
several meters of underground tunnels, comprises millions of workers, and can
defoliate a tree in a single night. The queen’s kingdom will persist 
as long as she does, which may be over a decade. Every spring, some of the queen’s
offspring prepare to leave. They grab a piece of home 
and crowd the surface chambers, preparing to fly off and mate, 
beginning the cycle anew.

the fungal gardens and the ants and the cockroaches that depend on them. The leafcutters mount 
a barrage of defenses. They rigorously weed Escovopsis out and partner up with different
microorganisms like yeasts and bacteria to stunt its growth. Eventually, the leafcutter colony covers
several meters of underground tunnels, comprises millions of workers, and can
defoliate a tree in a single night. The queen’s kingdom will persist 
as long as she does, which may be over a decade. Every spring, some of the queen’s
offspring prepare to leave. They grab a piece of home 
and crowd the surface chambers, preparing to fly off and mate, 
beginning the cycle anew.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1971, Ian Waterman suddenly
collapsed from a severe case of what seemed to be gastric flu. His illness passed after a few days, but a stranger set of symptoms lingered. Although his muscles and joints
remained healthy, Waterman was unable to move. In fact, he was unable to feel
anything from the neck down. Eventually, he was diagnosed with a rare
and extreme form of deafferentation, a neurological condition 
in which certain signals from the nervous system are 
interrupted or impaired. Without his body's constant feedback
on how his limbs were moving, Waterman was unable to sit up,
stand, or walk. But over time, he taught himself
to use sight to judge the distance of his limbs from other objects. And eventually he regained 
complete control of his body— so long as he could see it. We often don’t think of touch 
as being a vital part of movement. But touch is just one part 
of the somatosensory system, a network that oversees all the sensations arising from the surface and interior 
of our bodies. Touch, pain, temperature, 
and our awareness of our bodies in space— also known as proprioception— 
are regulated by this system. And when something goes wrong,
the effects can be dramatic. All these sensations are processed
by millions of tiny receptor cells embedded in our skin, muscles,
tendons, and organs. Every square centimeter of our skin
is packed with hundreds of these cells, and their shape, size, and depth determine
what kind of stimuli they respond to. Mechanoreceptors sense mechanical
deformation of the skin. This could be triggered by low
or high frequency vibrations, a stretch, 
or simply light, static pressure. Thermoreceptors respond
to temperature changes, while nociceptors sense pain. And propriocepters sit deep 
in your muscles and tendons, continually detecting 
and relaying information about the position of your body. Your brain then combines this information
with other sensory data to move through space 
without needing to see your limbs. All of these receptors work by sending
electrical signals to the brain through fibers they’re attached to. And the speed of those signals 
varies with the fiber’s thickness. For example, some nociceptors 
are attached to fibers with slightly more conductive,
fatty myelin than others. So when you get hurt, the electrical
impulses from thicker nociceptors trigger sharp, intense pain, while thin, unmyelinated nociceptors
are responsible for the dull, aching pain that follows. And since the fibers carrying 
tactile information are much thicker than those carrying nociceptive signals, rubbing an injury can produce 
temporary relief from the pain These receptors generate 
a constant flood of signals that travel through the nervous system
to the brain. But if this process is disrupted— either by damage to the skin, 
the nerves, or the brain— the network breaks down. And since it underpins so many
bodily functions, damage to the somatosensory system can
manifest in a wide variety of ways. In Waterman’s case, 
an autoimmune reaction attacked a large swath 
of his nervous system, leaving him with no tactile 
or proprioceptive sensations from the neck down. But deafferentation is just one 
of many somatosensory disorders. Individuals can receive damage to a 
specific brain area or a section of skin, resulting in the loss of certain 
sensations in particular locations. And the impact of this loss
can be significant. Losing tactile sensations makes it
difficult to gauge how much strength to use in a situation. Without the warning signals provided
by thermal and pain stimuli, we don’t react when our
bodies are damaged. And, being deprived of social touch
can cause a condition known as touch starvation, characterized by anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, 
and even a weakened immune system. Many individuals who face these realities
have found innovative ways to adapt. But it’s undeniable that all these
invisible sensations play a vital role 
in how we navigate the world— even if they can be difficult
to put your finger on.

**Transcript**:
In 1971, Ian Waterman suddenly
collapsed from a severe case of what seemed to be gastric flu. His illness passed after a few days, but a stranger set of symptoms lingered. Although his muscles and joints
remained healthy, Waterman was unable to move. In fact, he was unable to feel
anything from the neck down. Eventually, he was diagnosed with a rare
and extreme form of deafferentation, a neurological condition 
in which certain signals from the nervous system are 
interrupted or impaired. Without his body's constant feedback
on how his limbs were moving, Waterman was unable to sit up,
stand, or walk. But over time, he taught himself
to use sight to judge the distance of his limbs from other objects. And eventually he regained 
complete control of his body— so long as he could see it. We often don’t think of touch 
as being a vital part of movement. But touch is just one part 
of the somatosensory system, a network that oversees all the sensations arising from the surface and interior 
of our bodies. Touch, pain, temperature, 
and our awareness of our bodies in space— also known as proprioception— 
are regulated by this system. And when something goes wrong,
the effects can be dramatic. All these sensations are processed
by millions of tiny receptor cells embedded in our skin, muscles,
tendons, and organs. Every square centimeter of our skin
is packed with hundreds of these cells, and their shape, size, and depth determine
what kind of stimuli they respond to. Mechanoreceptors sense mechanical
deformation of the skin. This could be triggered by low
or high frequency vibrations, a stretch, 
or simply light, static pressure. Thermoreceptors respond
to temperature changes, while nociceptors sense pain. And propriocepters sit deep 
in your muscles and tendons, continually detecting 
and relaying information about the position of your body. Your brain then combines this information
with other sensory data to move through space 
without needing to see your limbs. All of these receptors work by sending
electrical signals to the brain through fibers they’re attached to. And the speed of those signals 
varies with the fiber’s thickness. For example, some nociceptors 
are attached to fibers with slightly more conductive,
fatty myelin than others. So when you get hurt, the electrical
impulses from thicker nociceptors trigger sharp, intense pain, while thin, unmyelinated nociceptors
are responsible for the dull, aching pain that follows. And since the fibers carrying 
tactile information are much thicker than those carrying nociceptive signals, rubbing an injury can produce 
temporary relief from the pain These receptors generate 
a constant flood of signals that travel through the nervous system
to the brain. But if this process is disrupted— either by damage to the skin, 
the nerves, or the brain— the network breaks down. And since it underpins so many
bodily functions, damage to the somatosensory system can
manifest in a wide variety of ways. In Waterman’s case, 
an autoimmune reaction attacked a large swath 
of his nervous system, leaving him with no tactile 
or proprioceptive sensations from the neck down. But deafferentation is just one 
of many somatosensory disorders. Individuals can receive damage to a 
specific brain area or a section of skin, resulting in the loss of certain 
sensations in particular locations. And the impact of this loss
can be significant. Losing tactile sensations makes it
difficult to gauge how much strength to use in a situation. Without the warning signals provided
by thermal and pain stimuli, we don’t react when our
bodies are damaged. And, being deprived of social touch
can cause a condition known as touch starvation, characterized by anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, 
and even a weakened immune system. Many individuals who face these realities
have found innovative ways to adapt. But it’s undeniable that all these
invisible sensations play a vital role 
in how we navigate the world— even if they can be difficult
to put your finger on.

**Transcript**:
By 1917, Albert Einstein had explained 
the relationship between space and time. But, that year, he designed
a flawed airplane wing. His attempt was based 
on an incomplete theory of flight. Indeed, insufficient and inaccurate
explanations still circulate today. So, where did Einstein go wrong? And how do planes fly? Though we don’t always think of it
this way, air is a fluid medium— it’s just less dense 
than liquids like water. Things that are lighter than air
are buoyant within it, while heavier objects require an upward
force, called lift, to stay aloft. For planes, this force is mostly
generated by the wings. One especially pervasive false 
description of lift is the “Longer Path” 
or “Equal Transit Time” explanation. It states that air molecules traveling
over the top of a curved wing cover a longer distance than those
traveling underneath. For the air molecules above to reach
the wing’s trailing edge in the same instance as those 
that split off and went below, air must travel faster above, creating a pocket of lower pressure 
that lifts the plane. This explanation has
been thoroughly debunked. Air molecules floating above and below
the wing don't need to meet back up. In reality, the air traveling
above reaches the wing’s trailing edge much faster than the air beneath. To get a sense of how lift
is actually generated, let's simulate an airplane wing in motion. As it moves forward, the wing affects
the movement of the air around it. As air meets the wing’s solid surface,
a thin layer sticks to the wing. This layer pulls the surrounding
air with it. The air splits into pathways 
above and below the wing, following the wing’s contour. As the air that’s routed above makes 
its way around the nose of the wing, it experiences centripetal acceleration, the force you also feel 
in a sharply turning car. The air above therefore gathers more
speed than the air traveling below. This increased speed is coupled with a
decrease in pressure above the wing, which pulls even more air 
across the wing’s upper surface. The air flowing across the
lower surface, meanwhile, experiences less of a change
in direction and speed. The pressure across the wing’s 
lower surface is thus higher than that above the upper surface. This pressure difference results 
in the upwards force of lift. The faster the plane travels, the greater the pressure difference,
and the greater that force. Once it overcomes the downward force
of gravity, the plane takes off. Air flows smoothly around curved wings. But a wing’s curvature is
not the cause of lift. In fact, a flat wing that’s tilted 
upwards can also create lift— as long as the air bends around it, contributing to and reinforcing
the pressure difference. Meanwhile, having a wing
that’s too curved or steeply angled can be disastrous: the airflow above may detach 
from the wing and become turbulent. This is probably what happened 
with Einstein’s wing design, nicknamed “the cat’s back.” By increasing the wing’s curvature, Einstein thought it would 
generate more lift. But one test pilot reported 
that the plane wobbled like “a pregnant duck” in flight. Our explanation is still 
a simplified description of this nuanced, complex process. Other factors, like the air that’s flowing
meters beyond the wing’s surface— being swept up, then down— as well as air vortices formed
at the wing’s tips, all influence lift. And, while experts agree that 
the pressure difference generates lift, their explanations for how can vary. Some might emphasize the air’s behavior
at the wing’s surface, others the upward force created 
as the air is deflected downwards. However, there's no controversy
when it comes to the math. Engineers use a set of formulas 
called the Navier-Stokes equations to precisely model air’s flow 
around a wing and detail how lift is generated. More than a century after Einstein’s
foray into aeronautics, lift retains its reputation
as a confounding concept. But when it feels like it’s all going
to come crashing down, remember: it’s just the physics of fluid in motion. This video was made possible

the movement of the air around it. As air meets the wing’s solid surface,
a thin layer sticks to the wing. This layer pulls the surrounding
air with it. The air splits into pathways 
above and below the wing, following the wing’s contour. As the air that’s routed above makes 
its way around the nose of the wing, it experiences centripetal acceleration, the force you also feel 
in a sharply turning car. The air above therefore gathers more
speed than the air traveling below. This increased speed is coupled with a
decrease in pressure above the wing, which pulls even more air 
across the wing’s upper surface. The air flowing across the
lower surface, meanwhile, experiences less of a change
in direction and speed. The pressure across the wing’s 
lower surface is thus higher than that above the upper surface. This pressure difference results 
in the upwards force of lift. The faster the plane travels, the greater the pressure difference,
and the greater that force. Once it overcomes the downward force
of gravity, the plane takes off. Air flows smoothly around curved wings. But a wing’s curvature is
not the cause of lift. In fact, a flat wing that’s tilted 
upwards can also create lift— as long as the air bends around it, contributing to and reinforcing
the pressure difference. Meanwhile, having a wing
that’s too curved or steeply angled can be disastrous: the airflow above may detach 
from the wing and become turbulent. This is probably what happened 
with Einstein’s wing design, nicknamed “the cat’s back.” By increasing the wing’s curvature, Einstein thought it would 
generate more lift. But one test pilot reported 
that the plane wobbled like “a pregnant duck” in flight. Our explanation is still 
a simplified description of this nuanced, complex process. Other factors, like the air that’s flowing
meters beyond the wing’s surface— being swept up, then down— as well as air vortices formed
at the wing’s tips, all influence lift. And, while experts agree that 
the pressure difference generates lift, their explanations for how can vary. Some might emphasize the air’s behavior
at the wing’s surface, others the upward force created 
as the air is deflected downwards. However, there's no controversy
when it comes to the math. Engineers use a set of formulas 
called the Navier-Stokes equations to precisely model air’s flow 
around a wing and detail how lift is generated. More than a century after Einstein’s
foray into aeronautics, lift retains its reputation
as a confounding concept. But when it feels like it’s all going
to come crashing down, remember: it’s just the physics of fluid in motion. This video was made possible

**Transcript**:
By 1917, Albert Einstein had explained 
the relationship between space and time. But, that year, he designed
a flawed airplane wing. His attempt was based 
on an incomplete theory of flight. Indeed, insufficient and inaccurate
explanations still circulate today. So, where did Einstein go wrong? And how do planes fly? Though we don’t always think of it
this way, air is a fluid medium— it’s just less dense 
than liquids like water. Things that are lighter than air
are buoyant within it, while heavier objects require an upward
force, called lift, to stay aloft. For planes, this force is mostly
generated by the wings. One especially pervasive false 
description of lift is the “Longer Path” 
or “Equal Transit Time” explanation. It states that air molecules traveling
over the top of a curved wing cover a longer distance than those
traveling underneath. For the air molecules above to reach
the wing’s trailing edge in the same instance as those 
that split off and went below, air must travel faster above, creating a pocket of lower pressure 
that lifts the plane. This explanation has
been thoroughly debunked. Air molecules floating above and below
the wing don't need to meet back up. In reality, the air traveling
above reaches the wing’s trailing edge much faster than the air beneath. To get a sense of how lift
is actually generated, let's simulate an airplane wing in motion. As it moves forward, the wing affects
the movement of the air around it. As air meets the wing’s solid surface,
a thin layer sticks to the wing. This layer pulls the surrounding
air with it. The air splits into pathways 
above and below the wing, following the wing’s contour. As the air that’s routed above makes 
its way around the nose of the wing, it experiences centripetal acceleration, the force you also feel 
in a sharply turning car. The air above therefore gathers more
speed than the air traveling below. This increased speed is coupled with a
decrease in pressure above the wing, which pulls even more air 
across the wing’s upper surface. The air flowing across the
lower surface, meanwhile, experiences less of a change
in direction and speed. The pressure across the wing’s 
lower surface is thus higher than that above the upper surface. This pressure difference results 
in the upwards force of lift. The faster the plane travels, the greater the pressure difference,

**Transcript**:
He was part of America's fight
for freedom and equality. But were his enlightened principles
outweighed by participation in a greater injustice? Find out on History versus 
Thomas Jefferson. Order! Order! Hey, that’s one 
of the guys from Mt. Rushmore. Ahem. This is Thomas Jefferson, founding father of the United States
of America and primary author 
of the Declaration of Independence. The document that established 
the US as a democratic republic on the principle that everyone
is created equal. If by “everyone” you mean 
property-owning white men. At the time Jefferson was writing, one fifth of the colonies’ population 
was enslaved. Surely he couldn’t be expected
to single-handedly overturn the institution of slavery? Couldn’t he have just written 
that into the Declaration? It wasn’t that simple, Your Honor. Jefferson was one of five authors, and the document had to be ratified
by the Continental Congress. He included a clause opposing 
the slave trade, but state delegates removed it. Nevertheless, Jefferson recognized
slavery as an immoral institution and condemned it throughout his life. But Jefferson’s words never came close
to matching his actions! As Virginia’s governor, he did nothing
to change the state slave laws. And in his personal life, 
he held over 600 people in slavery. Furthermore, he believed Black people
were intellectual inferiors who, if emancipated, should return 
to their countries of origin. Frankly, there’s no argument that
Jefferson did anything significant to combat slavery. It’s true, Your Honor. But Jefferson did make 
important contributions to religious, financial,
and gender equality. He led the charge for separating
church and state, removing government funding 
for Virginia’s Anglican Church, and paving the way for our modern
understanding of religious freedom. Jefferson also drafted laws that weakened
the power of inherited wealth and pushed for the state-funded education 
of boys and girls. All valuable reforms, but you’re avoiding 
the fundamental issue here. None of this benefited enslaved people
or Indigenous Americans, and it’s ridiculous to argue
that Jefferson was pursuing equality when his policies frequently harmed
non-white groups. Policies such as authorizing the military to exterminate Indigenous communities
during the Revolutionary War. Objection! Those Northwestern tribes were
allied with the British. In peacetime, Jefferson did his best 
to avoid conflict with Native Americans and believed they could be equal 
to whites. “Could be equal”? Listen to yourself! Are you defending his attempts to forcibly
assimilate Indigenous communities? Jefferson’s recommendations
even formed the basis for the Indian Removal Act years later. Recommendations? Why not laws? Thomas Jefferson served as a diplomat
and Secretary of State before being elected as Vice President
under John Adams in 1796. A role in which he undermined
the President’s authority. Jefferson argued that states 
should have the power to overrule federal laws
they deemed unconstitutional— an argument some Southern states
would cite while seceding from the Union 70 years later. I think it’s a little unreasonable to lay 
the entire Civil War at Jefferson’s feet. Besides, his defense of states’
rights was motivated by the president’s overreaching
central government. As part of Adams’ preparations
for war with France, he signed legislation that tightened
restrictions on immigrants and limited criticism of the government. Jefferson was just trying
to protect the public. And ultimately, his efforts were 
so popular that he was elected as the next president. A dubious victory. He only won because states were allowed
to count enslaved people towards their population without giving
them voting rights. This system gave states that held people
in slavery additional voting power in the Electoral College 
until the Civil War. Be that as it may, 
Jefferson was a popular president. He worked to prevent the country
from taking on too much debt, and successfully led the US through the
Napoleonic and the Barbary Wars. Plus, he dramatically expanded 
the country’s territory through the Louisiana Purchase. Where he once again failed to stop
slavery from taking hold. I’ll remind you that President Jefferson
signed a law forbidding the importation 
of enslaved people in 1807. And yet he continued to enslave those
already on American soil— including his own flesh and blood. Pardon? Following his wife's death, Jefferson began a relationship with her
half-sister and maid, Sally Hemings. Jefferson fathered six children
with Hemings and kept the entire relationship secret, while continuing to publicly denounce
the personhood of Black Americans. Jefferson freed several members
of the Hemings family, including his children with Sally— While refusing to free anyone else. Despite enslaving over 600 people,
Jefferson only freed 10. Five during his life and five in his will— all members of the Hemings family. Even I have to admit, 
this seems indefensible. It’s true, Your Honor. Despite pursuing what he believed 
to be equality, Jefferson failed to uphold his own ideals. Ultimately, he was a man of his time— living in an economy that relied 
on exploitation and enslaved labor. That’s hardly a defense when many 
of Jefferson’s contemporaries opposed slavery and took action
to abolish it. Even if some people considered
him a great man in his time, he doesn’t have to be an icon in ours. Well, I hear Mount Rushmore has
a problematic past, too. Can we judge historical figures
by modern standards? And what responsibilities do 
powerful people have to the future? Answering these questions is all part
of putting history on trial.

**Transcript**:
While we often talk about puberty’s
effect on the body, what gets overlooked are the fascinating
changes that happen in the brain. I’ve been sent here to talk 
to you about puberty. Any questions? During puberty, your reproductive organs
grow and mature. Any questions? This ripening allows you to become
a sexually mature adult. There are so many other changes 
to your body that puberty can seem almost magical. I think I'll take it from here. Puberty, in fact, 
begins in the brain. At some point, usually 
between the ages of 9 and 14, puberty is triggered when a region 
known as the hypothalamus releases waves of a specialized hormone. As convenient as it would be to go 
to sleep a child and wake up an adult, this maturation is slow, and puberty lasts as long as 4 to 5 years. And during this extended process, the brain undergoes 
its own transformation, thanks to two of puberty’s key players—
estrogen and testosterone. Produced in the developing 
testes and ovaries, these hormones hitch a ride 
to the brain via the bloodstream. Once there, they interact 
with receptors on neurons, changing the way the individual cells 
work and function by making them more or less excitable, 
altering their growth, or reshaping their connections. Cumulatively, this can change how
you feel, think, and behave. For example, hormones remodel 
and develop the limbic system, a collection of brain regions responsible
for emotional behavior. Research in animal models suggests 
that the amygdala undergoes changes in size and connectivity during puberty. The amygdala’s function is wide-ranging, from detecting threats 
in your environment, to helping you recognize emotions 
in your friend’s faces. Its development allows you to better
connect with your peers, while priming your brain 
for learning and discovery. Likewise, puberty organizes
and restructures the nucleus accumbens involved in reward and sensation-seeking. Activity in this dopamine
hub is thought to drive the pleasurable sensations we feel when
doing rewarding activities, like spending time with friends 
or having new experiences. Several studies have found that as hormone levels increase
through puberty, so does the response 
of the nucleus accumbens. As a result, exploration and social
engagement may feel that much more important 
during adolescence. As these emotion and reward
centers rapidly develop, their connections with higher cortical
brain regions tend to do so on an extended timeline. These cortical regions, which help impose 
emotional regulation and impulse control, continue to grow well past puberty,
into your 20s. While teens are often unfairly stereotyped
as rash or impulsive, research reveals a more complex story. Teens are just as capable as adults 
of making thoughtful decisions when given the time and space. It’s only during high stress 
or in the heat of the moment that teens may find it more
difficult to manage emotions. Further, this lengthy cortical development
allows adolescent brains to remain adaptable as they learn
and grow in new situations, form their identities, and build 
the skill sets needed for adulthood. For all we know about the effects
of puberty on the brain, there remain many unanswered questions. What sets off the initial puberty
signal in the brain? Why is the average onset 
of puberty shifting earlier? And, while hormones may seem powerful,
they may not be the full story. Experiences you have during adolescence
may be just as influential as hormones in shaping and maturing
the developing brain. So while all these physical and mental
changes can make you feel as if puberty is in control, you have more power than you think. The everyday choices you make, from learning new skills, to being 
a good friend, to setting boundaries, ultimately steer the path 
of who you are and will become. Any questions?

brain regions tend to do so on an extended timeline. These cortical regions, which help impose 
emotional regulation and impulse control, continue to grow well past puberty,
into your 20s. While teens are often unfairly stereotyped
as rash or impulsive, research reveals a more complex story. Teens are just as capable as adults 
of making thoughtful decisions when given the time and space. It’s only during high stress 
or in the heat of the moment that teens may find it more
difficult to manage emotions. Further, this lengthy cortical development
allows adolescent brains to remain adaptable as they learn
and grow in new situations, form their identities, and build 
the skill sets needed for adulthood. For all we know about the effects
of puberty on the brain, there remain many unanswered questions. What sets off the initial puberty
signal in the brain? Why is the average onset 
of puberty shifting earlier? And, while hormones may seem powerful,
they may not be the full story. Experiences you have during adolescence
may be just as influential as hormones in shaping and maturing
the developing brain. So while all these physical and mental
changes can make you feel as if puberty is in control, you have more power than you think. The everyday choices you make, from learning new skills, to being 
a good friend, to setting boundaries, ultimately steer the path 
of who you are and will become. Any questions?

**Transcript**:
While we often talk about puberty’s
effect on the body, what gets overlooked are the fascinating
changes that happen in the brain. I’ve been sent here to talk 
to you about puberty. Any questions? During puberty, your reproductive organs
grow and mature. Any questions? This ripening allows you to become
a sexually mature adult. There are so many other changes 
to your body that puberty can seem almost magical. I think I'll take it from here. Puberty, in fact, 
begins in the brain. At some point, usually 
between the ages of 9 and 14, puberty is triggered when a region 
known as the hypothalamus releases waves of a specialized hormone. As convenient as it would be to go 
to sleep a child and wake up an adult, this maturation is slow, and puberty lasts as long as 4 to 5 years. And during this extended process, the brain undergoes 
its own transformation, thanks to two of puberty’s key players—
estrogen and testosterone. Produced in the developing 
testes and ovaries, these hormones hitch a ride 
to the brain via the bloodstream. Once there, they interact 
with receptors on neurons, changing the way the individual cells 
work and function by making them more or less excitable, 
altering their growth, or reshaping their connections. Cumulatively, this can change how
you feel, think, and behave. For example, hormones remodel 
and develop the limbic system, a collection of brain regions responsible
for emotional behavior. Research in animal models suggests 
that the amygdala undergoes changes in size and connectivity during puberty. The amygdala’s function is wide-ranging, from detecting threats 
in your environment, to helping you recognize emotions 
in your friend’s faces. Its development allows you to better
connect with your peers, while priming your brain 
for learning and discovery. Likewise, puberty organizes
and restructures the nucleus accumbens involved in reward and sensation-seeking. Activity in this dopamine
hub is thought to drive the pleasurable sensations we feel when
doing rewarding activities, like spending time with friends 
or having new experiences. Several studies have found that as hormone levels increase
through puberty, so does the response 
of the nucleus accumbens. As a result, exploration and social
engagement may feel that much more important 
during adolescence. As these emotion and reward
centers rapidly develop, their connections with higher cortical
brain regions tend to do so on an extended timeline. These cortical regions, which help impose 
emotional regulation and impulse control, continue to grow well past puberty,
into your 20s. While teens are often unfairly stereotyped
as rash or impulsive, research reveals a more complex story. Teens are just as capable as adults 
of making thoughtful decisions when given the time and space. It’s only during high stress

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
As soon as Pharaoh Khufu ascended
the throne circa 2575 BCE, work on his eternal resting place began. The structure’s architect, Hemiunu, determined he would need 20 years
to finish the royal tomb. But what he could not predict was
that this monument would remain the world’s tallest manmade structure
for over 3,800 years. To construct the Great Pyramid, Hemiunu would need to dig 
a 6-and-a-half-kilometer canal, quarry enormous amounts of limestone
and granite, and use kilometers of rope 
to pull stones into place. Today, there are still vigorous debates
about the exact methods the Egyptians employed. But we do know that first Hemiunu
needed a construction site. The Egyptians spoke of death 
as going west like the setting sun, and the Nile’s west bank had 
a plateau of bedrock that could support the pyramid 
better than shifting sand. In a brilliant timesaving move, masons carved the plateau itself 
to look like the stones used for the rest of the pyramid. With this level foundation in place,
construction could begin. The project called for a staggering
25,000 workers, but fortunately, Hemiunu had
an established labor supply. Egyptians were required to perform 
manual labor for the government throughout the year, and citizens from across the country
came to contribute. Workers performed a wide range
of tasks, from crafting tools and clothes
to administrative work to back-breaking manual labor. But contrary to popular belief, 
these workers were not enslaved people. In fact, these citizens were housed
and fed with rations better than the average Egyptian 
could afford. To complete the project in 20 years, one block of stone would need 
to be quarried, transported, and pushed into place 
every 3 minutes, 365 days a year. Workers averaged 10-hour days, hauling
limestone from two different quarries. One was close to the site, but its fossil-lined yellow stone
was deemed suitable only for the pyramid’s interior. Stones for the outside were hauled 
from roughly 13 kilometers away, using 9-meter long sleds 
made from giant cedar trunks. When mined from the ground, limestone is soft and splits easily
into straight lines. But after air exposure it hardens, requiring wooden mallets and copper
chisels to shape. The pyramid used over 2 million stones,
each weighing up to 80 tons. And there was no room for error
in how they were shaped. Even the smallest inaccuracy at the bottom
of the pyramid could result in a catastrophic failure at the top. Researchers know where the materials used
to build the pyramids came from and how they were transported, but the actual construction process
remains mysterious. Most experts agree that limestone ramps
were used to move the stones into place, but there are many theories on the number
of ramps and their locations. And the pyramid’s exterior
is just half the story. Since death could come
for the pharaoh at any time, Hemiunu always needed an accessible
burial chamber at the ready, so three separate burial chambers
were built during construction. The last of these, 
known as the King’s Chamber, is a spacious granite room
with a soaring ceiling, located at the heart of the pyramid. it lay on top of an 8.5-meter high
passageway called the Grand Gallery, which may have been used 
as an ancient freight elevator to move granite up the pyramid’s interior. Granite was used for all 
the pyramid’s support beams. Much stronger than limestone, 
but extremely difficult to shape, workers used dolerite rocks as hammers
to slowly quarry the stone. To ensure the granite beams would be ready
when he needed them, Hemiunu dispatched 500 workers 
in the project’s first year so that the material would be ready
12 years later. Five stories of granite sit
atop the King’s Chamber, preventing the pyramid 
from collapsing in on itself. Once complete, the entire structure
was encased with white limestone, polished with sand and stone
until it gleamed. Finally, a capstone was placed on top. Covered with electrum 
and glimmering like gold, this peak shined like
a second sun over all of Egypt. This video was made possible with support

**Transcript**:
As soon as Pharaoh Khufu ascended
the throne circa 2575 BCE, work on his eternal resting place began. The structure’s architect, Hemiunu, determined he would need 20 years
to finish the royal tomb. But what he could not predict was
that this monument would remain the world’s tallest manmade structure
for over 3,800 years. To construct the Great Pyramid, Hemiunu would need to dig 
a 6-and-a-half-kilometer canal, quarry enormous amounts of limestone
and granite, and use kilometers of rope 
to pull stones into place. Today, there are still vigorous debates
about the exact methods the Egyptians employed. But we do know that first Hemiunu
needed a construction site. The Egyptians spoke of death 
as going west like the setting sun, and the Nile’s west bank had 
a plateau of bedrock that could support the pyramid 
better than shifting sand. In a brilliant timesaving move, masons carved the plateau itself 
to look like the stones used for the rest of the pyramid. With this level foundation in place,
construction could begin. The project called for a staggering
25,000 workers, but fortunately, Hemiunu had
an established labor supply. Egyptians were required to perform 
manual labor for the government throughout the year, and citizens from across the country
came to contribute. Workers performed a wide range
of tasks, from crafting tools and clothes
to administrative work to back-breaking manual labor. But contrary to popular belief, 
these workers were not enslaved people. In fact, these citizens were housed
and fed with rations better than the average Egyptian 
could afford. To complete the project in 20 years, one block of stone would need 
to be quarried, transported, and pushed into place 
every 3 minutes, 365 days a year. Workers averaged 10-hour days, hauling
limestone from two different quarries. One was close to the site, but its fossil-lined yellow stone
was deemed suitable only for the pyramid’s interior. Stones for the outside were hauled 
from roughly 13 kilometers away, using 9-meter long sleds 
made from giant cedar trunks. When mined from the ground, limestone is soft and splits easily
into straight lines. But after air exposure it hardens, requiring wooden mallets and copper
chisels to shape. The pyramid used over 2 million stones,
each weighing up to 80 tons. And there was no room for error
in how they were shaped. Even the smallest inaccuracy at the bottom
of the pyramid could result in a catastrophic failure at the top. Researchers know where the materials used
to build the pyramids came from and how they were transported, but the actual construction process
remains mysterious. Most experts agree that limestone ramps
were used to move the stones into place, but there are many theories on the number
of ramps and their locations. And the pyramid’s exterior
is just half the story. Since death could come
for the pharaoh at any time, Hemiunu always needed an accessible
burial chamber at the ready, so three separate burial chambers
were built during construction. The last of these, 
known as the King’s Chamber, is a spacious granite room
with a soaring ceiling, located at the heart of the pyramid. it lay on top of an 8.5-meter high
passageway called the Grand Gallery, which may have been used 
as an ancient freight elevator to move granite up the pyramid’s interior. Granite was used for all 
the pyramid’s support beams. Much stronger than limestone, 
but extremely difficult to shape, workers used dolerite rocks as hammers
to slowly quarry the stone. To ensure the granite beams would be ready
when he needed them, Hemiunu dispatched 500 workers 
in the project’s first year so that the material would be ready
12 years later. Five stories of granite sit
atop the King’s Chamber, preventing the pyramid 
from collapsing in on itself. Once complete, the entire structure
was encased with white limestone, polished with sand and stone
until it gleamed. Finally, a capstone was placed on top. Covered with electrum 
and glimmering like gold, this peak shined like
a second sun over all of Egypt. This video was made possible with support

**Transcript**:
In the wealthiest circles 
of Victorian England, bizarre fads ran rampant. But perhaps none was as strange
as the tapeworm diet, in which dieters swallowed
an unhatched tapeworm and let it grow inside them 
by consuming undigested meals. Obviously, this is an exceptionally
dangerous and unhealthy way to manage your weight. However, while modern fad diets
aren't usually this extreme, they do promise similar results;
specifically, losing weight fast. So, are there any fast diets that do work? And are any of them 
actually healthy for you? To answer these questions, 
let’s consider a thought experiment. Sam and Felix are identical twins
both planning to go on a diet. They share the same height, weight,
fat and muscle mass. But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,
while Felix wants to go fast. Sam's plan is to gradually decrease
his calorie intake and increase his regular exercise. With less energy coming in
and more being expended, he’s creating an energy deficit
inside his body. To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking 
down his emergency glucose supply, stored in the liver 
in the form of glycogen. Then, after 4 to 6 hours, 
his body starts burning fat cells as a major energy source. This process releases lipid droplets which are broken down into compounds
that float through the bloodstream and provide energy to organs and tissues. Felix aims to create 
a similar energy deficit by dramatically cutting 
his calorie intake. Unlike Sam, 
who’s still eating smaller meals, Felix is eating almost nothing. And his body responds by going
into a starvation response. Felix’s body breaks down his entire store
of emergency glucose in just 18 hours. And while Sam steadily replenishes
glycogen with every healthy meal, Felix’s low-calorie diet does not. Desperate for energy, his body starts
breaking down other materials, including his muscles. Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise 
is maintaining his muscle mass. This means he’ll use more energy
both during exercise and at rest, making it easier for him to lose weight. Felix, on the other hand,
is losing muscle mass and burning fewer calories than ever
for his body's basic functions, making weight loss even more difficult. Despite all this, there’s one element
of Felix’s fast diet that might make him think
he's on the right track. Every gram of glycogen is bound
to several grams of water. This can add up to two kilograms
of water weight, all of which is lost 
when the glycogen is depleted. For Felix, this might seem like
he’s losing weight fast. But as soon as he stops starving himself, his body will replenish its glycogen store
and regain that weight. Clearly, Felix’s plan does
more harm than good, but extreme calorie reduction diets
aren’t the only regimens promising to shed weight fast. Plans called “detoxification diets” 
either promote or restrict certain foods to provide specific nutrients
in high quantities. These can be useful for addressing
some nutritional problems, but they’re far too specific 
to be used as general cure-alls. For example, for a person 
with low vitamin A, a juice diet might be helpful. But for someone high in vitamin A,
juicing could be disastrous. And regardless of personal nutrition, maintaining a juice diet 
over multiple weeks is likely to compromise the immune system due to a lack of essential fats
and proteins. Therein lies the problem 
with all these fast-moving diets— whether you’re cutting calories
or food groups, extreme diets are a shock to your system. There are well-established rates 
of healthy weight loss motivated by both diet and exercise that account for genetic and medical
differences. And staying on those timelines requires 
a dietary lifestyle that’s sustainable. In fact, some of the worst side effects
of extreme diets are rarely discussed since so few people
stick with them, it also bears mentioning that many
societies have unhealthy relationships with weight, and people are often pressured to diet for
reasons other than health or happiness. So rather than trying to lose weight fast, we should all be taking our time 
to figure out what the healthiest lifestyle
is for ourselves.

**Transcript**:
In the wealthiest circles 
of Victorian England, bizarre fads ran rampant. But perhaps none was as strange
as the tapeworm diet, in which dieters swallowed
an unhatched tapeworm and let it grow inside them 
by consuming undigested meals. Obviously, this is an exceptionally
dangerous and unhealthy way to manage your weight. However, while modern fad diets
aren't usually this extreme, they do promise similar results;
specifically, losing weight fast. So, are there any fast diets that do work? And are any of them 
actually healthy for you? To answer these questions, 
let’s consider a thought experiment. Sam and Felix are identical twins
both planning to go on a diet. They share the same height, weight,
fat and muscle mass. But Sam is hoping to lose weight slowly,
while Felix wants to go fast. Sam's plan is to gradually decrease
his calorie intake and increase his regular exercise. With less energy coming in
and more being expended, he’s creating an energy deficit
inside his body. To compensate, Sam’s body begins breaking 
down his emergency glucose supply, stored in the liver 
in the form of glycogen. Then, after 4 to 6 hours, 
his body starts burning fat cells as a major energy source. This process releases lipid droplets which are broken down into compounds
that float through the bloodstream and provide energy to organs and tissues. Felix aims to create 
a similar energy deficit by dramatically cutting 
his calorie intake. Unlike Sam, 
who’s still eating smaller meals, Felix is eating almost nothing. And his body responds by going
into a starvation response. Felix’s body breaks down his entire store
of emergency glucose in just 18 hours. And while Sam steadily replenishes
glycogen with every healthy meal, Felix’s low-calorie diet does not. Desperate for energy, his body starts
breaking down other materials, including his muscles. Meanwhile, Sam’s regular exercise 
is maintaining his muscle mass. This means he’ll use more energy
both during exercise and at rest, making it easier for him to lose weight. Felix, on the other hand,
is losing muscle mass and burning fewer calories than ever
for his body's basic functions, making weight loss even more difficult. Despite all this, there’s one element
of Felix’s fast diet that might make him think
he's on the right track. Every gram of glycogen is bound
to several grams of water. This can add up to two kilograms
of water weight, all of which is lost 
when the glycogen is depleted. For Felix, this might seem like
he’s losing weight fast. But as soon as he stops starving himself, his body will replenish its glycogen store
and regain that weight. Clearly, Felix’s plan does
more harm than good, but extreme calorie reduction diets
aren’t the only regimens promising to shed weight fast. Plans called “detoxification diets” 
either promote or restrict certain foods to provide specific nutrients
in high quantities. These can be useful for addressing
some nutritional problems, but they’re far too specific 
to be used as general cure-alls. For example, for a person 
with low vitamin A, a juice diet might be helpful. But for someone high in vitamin A,
juicing could be disastrous. And regardless of personal nutrition, maintaining a juice diet 
over multiple weeks is likely to compromise the immune system due to a lack of essential fats
and proteins. Therein lies the problem 
with all these fast-moving diets— whether you’re cutting calories
or food groups, extreme diets are a shock to your system. There are well-established rates 
of healthy weight loss motivated by both diet and exercise that account for genetic and medical
differences. And staying on those timelines requires 
a dietary lifestyle that’s sustainable. In fact, some of the worst side effects
of extreme diets are rarely discussed since so few people
stick with them, it also bears mentioning that many
societies have unhealthy relationships with weight, and people are often pressured to diet for
reasons other than health or happiness. So rather than trying to lose weight fast, we should all be taking our time 
to figure out what the healthiest lifestyle
is for ourselves.

**Transcript**:
It was dark when two mysterious, 
shrouded figures appeared in the hillside village. The strangers knocked on every door 
in town, asking for food and shelter. But, again and again, 
they were turned away. Soon, there was just one door left: that of a small, thatched shack. An elderly couple, Baucis and Philemon,
answered the thunderous knock. Although there was something
off about these visitors, it was in the pair’s nature
to care for those in need. Philemon invited them to rest, and the cottage flooded with warmth
as Baucis teased the fire back to life. When they were young, Baucis and Philemon
had fallen in love, married, 
and settled in the humble cottage. Decades later, their home
was still standing— and they were more devoted
to each other than ever. The strangers watched intently as Baucis
nestled twigs under a battered pot filled with vegetables. The couple could rarely afford meat,
but in honor of their guests, Philemon cut strips from an aging shank
for the stew. They made cheerful conversation 
and offered their visitors hot baths. Baucis used a chip of broken clay 
to balance the wobbly table’s legs and rubbed its surface with mint 
until it smelled sweet and fresh. Weaving around each other with care, the couple transformed 
what they had into a feast. Soon, the tabletop overflowed with food
and the last of their sweet wine. Privately, Baucis and Philemon worried 
that their provisions would run out. Yet, as the night wore on, and their strange guests 
took hearty gulps of wine, the clay vessel never ran dry. The couple, at first relieved, 
grew terrified. Their guests weren’t humble peasants
traveling the countryside. They were almost certainly gods 
in disguise— but which gods, 
they didn’t know. Panicked that their preparations
were inadequate, Baucis and Philemon searched 
for another offering. The only precious thing left was 
the goose that guarded their home. The couple repeatedly lunged
after the bird, but they were too worn out for the chase. So, they prepared to receive
the wrath of the gods. Their guests rose up, 
shedding their rags and mortal masks. Looming before them was Zeus, 
the storm-brewing ruler of the gods, and his son, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger
who shepherded mortals to the underworld. The gods told the old couple that, 
unlike the other townspeople, they had shown true xenia, 
or loving hospitality to strangers. They alone had passed the test. The gods commanded the couple
to follow them, and the group ascended
the nearest mountain. Nearing the summit, 
Baucis and Philemon looked back— but were shocked to see a murky swamp
where their village stood just moments before. As punishment for refusing
to shelter the gods, Zeus and Hermes had cast 
the townspeople underwater, leaving only their hosts’ home intact, Recalling their friends and neighbors, Baucis and Philemon couldn’t hide
their terror and mournful tears, even as their house transformed below. It grew larger and sprouted
marble pillars and steps. Legends etched themselves
onto its grand doors. Their rickety cottage had metamorphosed
into a gleaming temple for the gods. Hermes commended the couple and gently
asked if there was anything they desired. After a brief discussion, Philemon
requested that he and Baucis be permitted to care for the new temple. And he asked if, when their time came, 
they could die together, so neither would have to face life
without the other. Tending to the temple and one another, 
they lived many more years. Until, one day, Baucis noticed leaves
fluttering from her husband’s hands and looked down to find 
her own skin hardening. They embraced, becoming rooted in place. Vines wound around their legs 
and canopies flourished overhead. They bid each other a loving,
last farewell as humans. And where Baucis and Philemon 
had just stood, bent with age, there towered a linden and an oak tree, their branches intertwined for eternity.

they were turned away. Soon, there was just one door left: that of a small, thatched shack. An elderly couple, Baucis and Philemon,
answered the thunderous knock. Although there was something
off about these visitors, it was in the pair’s nature
to care for those in need. Philemon invited them to rest, and the cottage flooded with warmth
as Baucis teased the fire back to life. When they were young, Baucis and Philemon
had fallen in love, married, 
and settled in the humble cottage. Decades later, their home
was still standing— and they were more devoted
to each other than ever. The strangers watched intently as Baucis
nestled twigs under a battered pot filled with vegetables. The couple could rarely afford meat,
but in honor of their guests, Philemon cut strips from an aging shank
for the stew. They made cheerful conversation 
and offered their visitors hot baths. Baucis used a chip of broken clay 
to balance the wobbly table’s legs and rubbed its surface with mint 
until it smelled sweet and fresh. Weaving around each other with care, the couple transformed 
what they had into a feast. Soon, the tabletop overflowed with food
and the last of their sweet wine. Privately, Baucis and Philemon worried 
that their provisions would run out. Yet, as the night wore on, and their strange guests 
took hearty gulps of wine, the clay vessel never ran dry. The couple, at first relieved, 
grew terrified. Their guests weren’t humble peasants
traveling the countryside. They were almost certainly gods 
in disguise— but which gods, 
they didn’t know. Panicked that their preparations
were inadequate, Baucis and Philemon searched 
for another offering. The only precious thing left was 
the goose that guarded their home. The couple repeatedly lunged
after the bird, but they were too worn out for the chase. So, they prepared to receive
the wrath of the gods. Their guests rose up, 
shedding their rags and mortal masks. Looming before them was Zeus, 
the storm-brewing ruler of the gods, and his son, Hermes, the fleet-footed messenger
who shepherded mortals to the underworld. The gods told the old couple that, 
unlike the other townspeople, they had shown true xenia, 
or loving hospitality to strangers. They alone had passed the test. The gods commanded the couple
to follow them, and the group ascended
the nearest mountain. Nearing the summit, 
Baucis and Philemon looked back— but were shocked to see a murky swamp
where their village stood just moments before. As punishment for refusing
to shelter the gods, Zeus and Hermes had cast 
the townspeople underwater, leaving only their hosts’ home intact, Recalling their friends and neighbors, Baucis and Philemon couldn’t hide
their terror and mournful tears, even as their house transformed below. It grew larger and sprouted
marble pillars and steps. Legends etched themselves
onto its grand doors. Their rickety cottage had metamorphosed
into a gleaming temple for the gods. Hermes commended the couple and gently
asked if there was anything they desired. After a brief discussion, Philemon
requested that he and Baucis be permitted to care for the new temple. And he asked if, when their time came, 
they could die together, so neither would have to face life
without the other. Tending to the temple and one another, 
they lived many more years. Until, one day, Baucis noticed leaves
fluttering from her husband’s hands and looked down to find 
her own skin hardening. They embraced, becoming rooted in place. Vines wound around their legs 
and canopies flourished overhead. They bid each other a loving,
last farewell as humans. And where Baucis and Philemon 
had just stood, bent with age, there towered a linden and an oak tree, their branches intertwined for eternity.

It was dark when two mysterious,

in town, asking for food and shelter. But, again and again, 
they were turned away. Soon, there was just one door left: that of a small, thatched shack. An elderly couple, Baucis and Philemon,
