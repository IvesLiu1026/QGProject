**Transcript**:
From the 1930s well into the 1960s, pregnancy testing required a slippery
piece of equipment: a female African clawed frog. For decades, hospitals and research labs
around the world had a trusted supply of these
handy amphibians, employing their help
in testing for pregnancy and in numerous other
scientific endeavors. So, what makes these phenomenal frogs
so special? The remarkable features
of the African clawed frog have fascinated researchers
since the 19th century. We often think of frogs as hopping
around to snatch up bugs with their lengthy tongues. But this water-dwelling species
is almost exclusively aquatic, having adapted primarily for swimming
rather than crawling or jumping. Weirder still, African clawed frogs
have no tongues at all. Instead, they suck food directly
into their mouths or use their hands to catch larger animals which they tear apart
with powerful hind claws. To help get close to their prey, their smooth skin can quickly change color
to blend into their surroundings. This camouflage ability was particularly
interesting to a trio of biologists in South Africa during the 1920s. Hillel Shapiro, Harry Zwarenstein,
and their teacher, Lancelot Hogben, were researching what role
the pituitary gland, a small region of the frog’s brain, might play in the
color changing mechanism. Removing the gland altogether impaired
the frogs’ ability to camouflage. But when Hogben injected them with
a pituitary extract derived from an ox, he found an even more surprising result— the frogs began laying eggs. Normally, African clawed frogs
only release eggs when a male frog is
nearby to fertilize them. But this ox hormone triggered their
ovulation without the presence of a male. And this process gave
the researchers an idea. They knew there was a chemical similarity
between the ox hormone and a hormone found in the urine
of pregnant people— a compound we know today as the
chorionic gonadotropin hormone, or hCG. In pregnancy tests of the day, animals like mice and rabbits were
injected with human urine as a way of testing
for the presence of hCG. However, this required multiple
days of injections, as well as killing and dissecting
the animals to see whether the hormone was present. Because of these hurdles, the test was
reserved for specific use cases, leaving most people waiting for visible
signs to determine if they were pregnant. But these frogs changed everything. They responded to hCG in roughly 9 hours
with no need for dissection. And since their large ovaries
constantly generate eggs, they could participate in numerous tests
over their 15 to 30 year lifespan. Better still, these frogs were abundant
in their native habitat, making them easy to find,
catch, and export. Before long, tens of thousands
of African clawed frogs were being shipped to hospitals
all over the world, making reliable pregnancy tests
widely available for the first time. In the 1970s, the frogs would be
superseded by chemical tests that detected hCG directly. But by then their widespread presence
in laboratories had made African clawed frogs
the star of numerous studies. Their rapid development and ability
to produce eggs in any season made them invaluable models
for developmental biology. African clawed frogs have even been
part of biological studies aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. However,
frogs can be slippery subjects. More than a few of these amphibians have
escaped their laboratory enclosures, and in many places, their ferocious appetite allowed them
to outcompete native amphibians. To make matters worse, they often carry a deadly
fungus called chytrid, which can cause an infection
that lethally disrupts the delicate functioning
of amphibian skin. In the 20th century, this fungal infection
has devastated amphibian populations around the globe, causing the extinction
of multiple frog species. Because of all these concerns, the African clawed frog is now classified
as an invasive species, and illegal in many regions. So in the end, like other pregnancy tests, the use of these frogs
in scientific research has had both
positive and negative results.

for developmental biology. African clawed frogs have even been
part of biological studies aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. However,
frogs can be slippery subjects. More than a few of these amphibians have
escaped their laboratory enclosures, and in many places, their ferocious appetite allowed them
to outcompete native amphibians. To make matters worse, they often carry a deadly
fungus called chytrid, which can cause an infection
that lethally disrupts the delicate functioning
of amphibian skin. In the 20th century, this fungal infection
has devastated amphibian populations around the globe, causing the extinction
of multiple frog species. Because of all these concerns, the African clawed frog is now classified
as an invasive species, and illegal in many regions. So in the end, like other pregnancy tests, the use of these frogs
in scientific research has had both
positive and negative results.

**Transcript**:
From the 1930s well into the 1960s, pregnancy testing required a slippery
piece of equipment: a female African clawed frog. For decades, hospitals and research labs
around the world had a trusted supply of these
handy amphibians, employing their help
in testing for pregnancy and in numerous other
scientific endeavors. So, what makes these phenomenal frogs
so special? The remarkable features
of the African clawed frog have fascinated researchers
since the 19th century. We often think of frogs as hopping
around to snatch up bugs with their lengthy tongues. But this water-dwelling species
is almost exclusively aquatic, having adapted primarily for swimming
rather than crawling or jumping. Weirder still, African clawed frogs
have no tongues at all. Instead, they suck food directly
into their mouths or use their hands to catch larger animals which they tear apart
with powerful hind claws. To help get close to their prey, their smooth skin can quickly change color
to blend into their surroundings. This camouflage ability was particularly
interesting to a trio of biologists in South Africa during the 1920s. Hillel Shapiro, Harry Zwarenstein,
and their teacher, Lancelot Hogben, were researching what role
the pituitary gland, a small region of the frog’s brain, might play in the
color changing mechanism. Removing the gland altogether impaired
the frogs’ ability to camouflage. But when Hogben injected them with
a pituitary extract derived from an ox, he found an even more surprising result— the frogs began laying eggs. Normally, African clawed frogs
only release eggs when a male frog is
nearby to fertilize them. But this ox hormone triggered their
ovulation without the presence of a male. And this process gave
the researchers an idea. They knew there was a chemical similarity
between the ox hormone and a hormone found in the urine
of pregnant people— a compound we know today as the
chorionic gonadotropin hormone, or hCG. In pregnancy tests of the day, animals like mice and rabbits were
injected with human urine as a way of testing
for the presence of hCG. However, this required multiple
days of injections, as well as killing and dissecting
the animals to see whether the hormone was present. Because of these hurdles, the test was
reserved for specific use cases, leaving most people waiting for visible
signs to determine if they were pregnant. But these frogs changed everything. They responded to hCG in roughly 9 hours
with no need for dissection. And since their large ovaries
constantly generate eggs, they could participate in numerous tests
over their 15 to 30 year lifespan. Better still, these frogs were abundant
in their native habitat, making them easy to find,
catch, and export. Before long, tens of thousands
of African clawed frogs were being shipped to hospitals
all over the world, making reliable pregnancy tests
widely available for the first time. In the 1970s, the frogs would be
superseded by chemical tests that detected hCG directly. But by then their widespread presence
in laboratories had made African clawed frogs
the star of numerous studies. Their rapid development and ability
to produce eggs in any season made them invaluable models
for developmental biology. African clawed frogs have even been
part of biological studies aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. However,
frogs can be slippery subjects. More than a few of these amphibians have
escaped their laboratory enclosures, and in many places, their ferocious appetite allowed them
to outcompete native amphibians. To make matters worse, they often carry a deadly

**Transcript**:
On December 19th, 1915,
an exhibition of radical artworks opened in what’s known today
as St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of these pieces pushed
the boundaries of form and style, but one was particularly controversial. Hanging in the room’s corner—
symbolically occupying a space traditionally reserved
for religious icons— was Kazimir Malevich’s “Black Square.” One attendee scoffed
at the painting’s simplicity, claiming that even a child
could have done it. Another went further, writing that
the “Black Square” would “lead us all to our doom.” Such critiques have plagued paintings
like Malevich’s ever since, their outward simplicity inspiring
outrage and confusion. But a closer look reveals that
not only is Malevich’s work more complicated than it first appears— it may not even be a painting
of a black square at all. Despite its name, you’ll find
the painting’s central form is neither perfectly black
nor perfectly square. Its sides aren't parallel
or equal in length, and the shape isn't quite
centered on the canvas. Instead, Malevich placed the form
slightly off-kilter, giving it the appearance of movement and the white surrounding it
a living, vibrating quality. Technical analysis has revealed that
Malevich already used the canvas for two other paintings. Today, cracks in the aging paint—
known as craquelure— reveal fragments of dusty yellows,
vibrant reds, and faded emeralds, hinting at all the stages Malevich
went through before arriving at the
painting’s final form. His creative process is also evident
in the vigorous brushstrokes, which are displayed proudly
and move in a multitude of directions. Fragments of hair
and Malevich’s fingerprints are also ingrained in the paint, adding both metaphorical
and literal texture to the work. In many ways, Malevich’s whole history
is embedded in the “Black Square.” Born to Polish-speaking
parents in Ukraine, he lived there until he finally saved
enough money to afford the trip to Moscow. Upon arrival in 1904, he plunged 
into all the avant-garde styles swirling around the city. He painted in the style of Impressionism
and absorbed Post-Impressionism. He passed through a Futurist phase and
then became influenced by the Cubists. And by 1913, he was on the verge
of a breakthrough. Malevich realized that even
the most cutting-edge artists were still just painting objects
from everyday life. But he was irresistibly drawn
to what he called the “desert, where nothing is real
except feeling.” And so, feeling became the substance
of his work. The result was the “Black Square”
and a new style he named “Suprematism,” where feeling alone was made supreme. This would be achieved through what
he called non-objectivity— a departure from the world of objects
so extreme it went beyond abstraction. Malevich believed the simplification and
distortion that characterized abstract art was ultimately meaningless, since these styles were still focused 
on depicting real world objects. To him, only the completely
non-representational would truly be new. While this radical approach
alarmed critics, Malevich was undeterred. He spent the next decade explaining
his Suprematist works in essays, and teaching his ideas
to a new generation of artists. But after Stalin's rise
to power in the 1920s, avant-garde approaches like Suprematism
were deemed unproductive to the Communist state. And eventually, it became dangerous to
produce any art outside Socialist Realism— an enforced artistic style celebrating
Soviet leaders and heroic workers. In 1930, Malevich was arrested
by Soviet authorities for spreading subversive ideas. Under severe pressure,
he returned to figuration, painting peasants standing robotically
in barren spaces. But even these later paintings retained
glimmers of his earlier ideas. Gradually, the figures lost
their arms and faces— disintegrating as mechanization
gripped the countryside. During this time,
Malevich also painted a self-portrait that seemed to have abandoned
Suprematism completely. But his open hand formed a quadrilateral, and in the painting's corner
was a tiny black square. This was the symbol of a man who suffered
through wars and revolutions, but never stopped pushing
to create a new art— a refuge of pure feeling that lay
beyond the burden of objects and the suffering of a divided world.

Question 4: What technique was used to analyze Malevich's "Black Square" that revealed fragments of other paintings underneath? Options: A. X-ray analysis, B. Technical analysis, C. Chemical analysis, D. Spectroscopy Correct Option: B

This question is similar to the ground truth MCQ because it deals with the analysis of a painting, specifically the technique used to reveal underlying details. Although the ground truth MCQ asks about the term for cracks that form as paintings age, the generated MCQ mentions "technical analysis" which is related to the process of examining a painting's physical properties, including the effects of aging.

However, it's worth noting that there isn't a direct match between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs. The generated MCQs do not explicitly ask about the term for cracks that form as paintings age.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would choose Question 4, but with the understanding that it's not a perfect match.

**Transcript**:
On December 19th, 1915,
an exhibition of radical artworks opened in what’s known today
as St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of these pieces pushed
the boundaries of form and style, but one was particularly controversial. Hanging in the room’s corner—
symbolically occupying a space traditionally reserved
for religious icons— was Kazimir Malevich’s “Black Square.” One attendee scoffed
at the painting’s simplicity, claiming that even a child
could have done it. Another went further, writing that
the “Black Square” would “lead us all to our doom.” Such critiques have plagued paintings
like Malevich’s ever since, their outward simplicity inspiring
outrage and confusion. But a closer look reveals that
not only is Malevich’s work more complicated than it first appears— it may not even be a painting
of a black square at all. Despite its name, you’ll find
the painting’s central form is neither perfectly black
nor perfectly square. Its sides aren't parallel
or equal in length, and the shape isn't quite
centered on the canvas. Instead, Malevich placed the form
slightly off-kilter, giving it the appearance of movement and the white surrounding it
a living, vibrating quality. Technical analysis has revealed that
Malevich already used the canvas for two other paintings. Today, cracks in the aging paint—
known as craquelure— reveal fragments of dusty yellows,
vibrant reds, and faded emeralds, hinting at all the stages Malevich
went through before arriving at the
painting’s final form. His creative process is also evident
in the vigorous brushstrokes, which are displayed proudly
and move in a multitude of directions. Fragments of hair
and Malevich’s fingerprints are also ingrained in the paint, adding both metaphorical
and literal texture to the work. In many ways, Malevich’s whole history
is embedded in the “Black Square.” Born to Polish-speaking
parents in Ukraine, he lived there until he finally saved
enough money to afford the trip to Moscow. Upon arrival in 1904, he plunged 
into all the avant-garde styles swirling around the city. He painted in the style of Impressionism
and absorbed Post-Impressionism. He passed through a Futurist phase and
then became influenced by the Cubists. And by 1913, he was on the verge
of a breakthrough. Malevich realized that even
the most cutting-edge artists were still just painting objects
from everyday life. But he was irresistibly drawn
to what he called the “desert, where nothing is real
except feeling.” And so, feeling became the substance
of his work. The result was the “Black Square”
and a new style he named “Suprematism,” where feeling alone was made supreme. This would be achieved through what
he called non-objectivity— a departure from the world of objects
so extreme it went beyond abstraction. Malevich believed the simplification and
distortion that characterized abstract art was ultimately meaningless, since these styles were still focused 
on depicting real world objects. To him, only the completely
non-representational would truly be new. While this radical approach
alarmed critics, Malevich was undeterred. He spent the next decade explaining
his Suprematist works in essays, and teaching his ideas
to a new generation of artists. But after Stalin's rise
to power in the 1920s, avant-garde approaches like Suprematism
were deemed unproductive to the Communist state. And eventually, it became dangerous to
produce any art outside Socialist Realism— an enforced artistic style celebrating
Soviet leaders and heroic workers. In 1930, Malevich was arrested
by Soviet authorities for spreading subversive ideas. Under severe pressure,
he returned to figuration, painting peasants standing robotically
in barren spaces. But even these later paintings retained
glimmers of his earlier ideas. Gradually, the figures lost
their arms and faces— disintegrating as mechanization
gripped the countryside. During this time,
Malevich also painted a self-portrait that seemed to have abandoned
Suprematism completely. But his open hand formed a quadrilateral, and in the painting's corner
was a tiny black square. This was the symbol of a man who suffered
through wars and revolutions, but never stopped pushing
to create a new art— a refuge of pure feeling that lay
beyond the burden of objects and the suffering of a divided world.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not present in the list. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that has some similarity with the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ is asking about Kazimir Malevich's birthplace. While there isn't a generated MCQ that directly asks about Malevich's birthplace, Question 1 mentions a location related to Malevich's artwork. However, it does not match the ground truth MCQ.

If I had to choose a generated MCQ that has some relation to the ground truth MCQ, I would choose Question 1, but with a note that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, since none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, I would recommend creating a new generated MCQ that directly asks about Malevich's birthplace.

Here is an example of a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: Kazimir Malevich was born to Polish-speaking parents in what is today _____.
Options: A. Latvia, B. Ukraine, C. Georgia, D. Estonia
Correct Option: B

non-representational would truly be new. While this radical approach
alarmed critics, Malevich was undeterred. He spent the next decade explaining
his Suprematist works in essays, and teaching his ideas
to a new generation of artists. But after Stalin's rise
to power in the 1920s, avant-garde approaches like Suprematism
were deemed unproductive to the Communist state. And eventually, it became dangerous to
produce any art outside Socialist Realism— an enforced artistic style celebrating
Soviet leaders and heroic workers. In 1930, Malevich was arrested
by Soviet authorities for spreading subversive ideas. Under severe pressure,
he returned to figuration, painting peasants standing robotically
in barren spaces. But even these later paintings retained
glimmers of his earlier ideas. Gradually, the figures lost
their arms and faces— disintegrating as mechanization
gripped the countryside. During this time,
Malevich also painted a self-portrait that seemed to have abandoned
Suprematism completely. But his open hand formed a quadrilateral, and in the painting's corner
was a tiny black square. This was the symbol of a man who suffered
through wars and revolutions, but never stopped pushing
to create a new art— a refuge of pure feeling that lay
beyond the burden of objects and the suffering of a divided world.

**Transcript**:
Here we see an early bird and
a night owl in their natural habitats. The early bird rises with the sun,
springing out of bed abuzz with energy. As the day goes on, they slowly get
more and more exhausted until finally crashing around sunset. Meanwhile, the night owl rises
long after the sun, stumbling groggily from their bed. After about 30 minutes—
or a cup of coffee— they begin to come to life. But they don’t really hit their stride
until later in the day, at which point they comfortably
coast past sunset, only heading to bed in the early hours
of the morning. For many, this is a familiar story,
and one that’s easy to cast yourself in. But how many people are truly
night owls or early birds? And are our natural sleep schedules
predetermined at birth, or can we change them? The truth is there’s a lot of space
between these extremes, and most people fall somewhere
in the middle. These behaviors are determined
by our circadian system— which is anchored by a pair
of nerve cell clusters located in the anterior hypothalamus. These nerve cells respond to light
exposure coming in through your eyes to track the day-night cycle that dictates
your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm. That steady rhythm helps determine
the body’s flow of hormones, with the broader circadian system
acting like a conductor that keeps your organs functioning
in time with one another. And a major part of that performance
is managing the body’s transitions between being awake and being asleep. Now, your circadian system can't just
decide its bedtime and knock you out. However, by tracking how much
light you typically get and when in your waking hours
you usually get it, the system can make predictions about
when you’re likely to need sleep and prepare your body accordingly. For example, if you consistently
go to sleep around 10 pm, your circadian system will start producing
sleep-inducing melatonin around two hours before then
to tell your body it’s time for bed. So if this rhythm is molded
by our sleep habits, can we change it just by sticking
to a strict schedule? To a degree. Everyone’s bodies are unique, so even two people with the same sleep
schedule might have different experiences based on their circadian system’s 
hormonal quirks. For example, where early birds generally
flood with cortisol just before waking up, night owls often have their cortisol peak
roughly 30 minutes after getting up. Hormonal differences like these determine
how you experience your circadian rhythm. And while these factors
can shift with age, you’re unlikely to grow out of your body’s
preferred sleep schedule. That said, you can cultivate habits
to help or hinder your circadian rhythm. Keeping consistent sleeping hours helps
your body accurately predict when to send out hormones, making it easier to stick
to your schedule. Conversely, research in sleep deprived
college students has found their unpredictable
sleeping habits weaken their entire circadian system. Compromised circadian rhythms
are less effective at coordinating organ functioning
and can incur health risks like metabolic disorders
and vulnerable immune systems. But perhaps just as important
as sleep hygiene is light hygiene. Getting sufficient contrast between
bright daylight and dimmer nighttime light is essential for synchronizing
your circadian rhythm, and nothing establishes this contrast
better than sunlight. Even on overcast days, sunlight is much
brighter than standard indoor lighting. So if you're typically
awake during the day, try getting outside as soon as possible
to teach your body when to be active and alert. It’s difficult to maintain
a sleep schedule that pushes against your
body’s preferences. And even if you succeed for months, it only takes one bad night to send
your circadian system back to baseline. But whether you’re an early bird,
night owl, or somewhere in between, it’s important to remember
that as long as you’re consistent, there’s no wrong time
to wake up or go to sleep. What matters most is getting enough rest
for the day ahead.

night owls or early birds? And are our natural sleep schedules
predetermined at birth, or can we change them? The truth is there’s a lot of space
between these extremes, and most people fall somewhere
in the middle. These behaviors are determined
by our circadian system— which is anchored by a pair
of nerve cell clusters located in the anterior hypothalamus. These nerve cells respond to light
exposure coming in through your eyes to track the day-night cycle that dictates
your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm. That steady rhythm helps determine
the body’s flow of hormones, with the broader circadian system
acting like a conductor that keeps your organs functioning
in time with one another. And a major part of that performance
is managing the body’s transitions between being awake and being asleep. Now, your circadian system can't just
decide its bedtime and knock you out. However, by tracking how much
light you typically get and when in your waking hours
you usually get it, the system can make predictions about
when you’re likely to need sleep and prepare your body accordingly. For example, if you consistently
go to sleep around 10 pm, your circadian system will start producing
sleep-inducing melatonin around two hours before then
to tell your body it’s time for bed. So if this rhythm is molded
by our sleep habits, can we change it just by sticking
to a strict schedule? To a degree. Everyone’s bodies are unique, so even two people with the same sleep
schedule might have different experiences based on their circadian system’s 
hormonal quirks. For example, where early birds generally
flood with cortisol just before waking up, night owls often have their cortisol peak
roughly 30 minutes after getting up. Hormonal differences like these determine
how you experience your circadian rhythm. And while these factors
can shift with age, you’re unlikely to grow out of your body’s
preferred sleep schedule. That said, you can cultivate habits
to help or hinder your circadian rhythm. Keeping consistent sleeping hours helps
your body accurately predict when to send out hormones, making it easier to stick
to your schedule. Conversely, research in sleep deprived
college students has found their unpredictable
sleeping habits weaken their entire circadian system. Compromised circadian rhythms
are less effective at coordinating organ functioning
and can incur health risks like metabolic disorders
and vulnerable immune systems. But perhaps just as important
as sleep hygiene is light hygiene. Getting sufficient contrast between
bright daylight and dimmer nighttime light is essential for synchronizing
your circadian rhythm, and nothing establishes this contrast
better than sunlight. Even on overcast days, sunlight is much
brighter than standard indoor lighting. So if you're typically
awake during the day, try getting outside as soon as possible
to teach your body when to be active and alert. It’s difficult to maintain
a sleep schedule that pushes against your
body’s preferences. And even if you succeed for months, it only takes one bad night to send
your circadian system back to baseline. But whether you’re an early bird,
night owl, or somewhere in between, it’s important to remember
that as long as you’re consistent, there’s no wrong time
to wake up or go to sleep. What matters most is getting enough rest
for the day ahead.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I have identified the most similar generated MCQ as:

**Question 9: What are the potential health risks associated with compromised circadian rhythms?**

Although this question does not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, it is related to the concept of weakening the circadian rhythm, which is the main idea behind the ground truth MCQ. However, a more suitable match can be found in the options of another question.

A better match is **Question 8: How can an individual's sleep schedule be influenced by their circadian system?** and more specifically, its counterpart in the options of **Question 7: What happens to the body's circadian system when an individual consistently goes to bed and wakes up at the same time?** and **Question 5: How does the circadian system predict when an individual is likely to need sleep?** 

However, the best match is **not explicitly listed**, but we can find a suitable counterpart in **Question 8's** option A: "By sticking to a strict schedule" and its opposite idea in **Question 7's** option A: "It becomes more irregular". 

Among the given options, the most suitable match is **Question 8**, but since the options do not exactly match the ground truth MCQ, I will provide an alternative.

An alternative is to look for the question that most closely matches the intent of the ground truth MCQ. In this case, it would be a question that asks about the action that weakens the circadian rhythm.

Considering this, I found a match in **Question 12: What is the impact of compromised circadian rhythms on organ functioning?** and **Question 9: What are the potential health risks associated with compromised circadian rhythms?** but these questions do not ask about the action.

However, I can provide the index of a question that somewhat relates to the ground truth MCQ's intent.

The index of the most similar generated MCQ is **8**.

Keep in mind that this is an approximation, as there isn't a perfect match among the provided generated MCQs.

**Transcript**:
Here we see an early bird and
a night owl in their natural habitats. The early bird rises with the sun,
springing out of bed abuzz with energy. As the day goes on, they slowly get
more and more exhausted until finally crashing around sunset. Meanwhile, the night owl rises
long after the sun, stumbling groggily from their bed. After about 30 minutes—
or a cup of coffee— they begin to come to life. But they don’t really hit their stride
until later in the day, at which point they comfortably
coast past sunset, only heading to bed in the early hours
of the morning. For many, this is a familiar story,

**Transcript**:
I know a lot of us are, like, ignoring COVID now. Sure it’s still a thing out there you can catch, but most people seem tired of hearing about it. But not only is COVID not going anywhere – for some people, infection is followed by a protracted, debilitating condition known 
informally as long COVID. The good news is that scientists 
are hard at work on solving that. And while we don’t know 
what causes long COVID yet, we’re getting closer to 
understanding what’s involved, which points at ways to treat it. Today, let’s talk about one area 
where we’ve made some progress. And it has to do with sticky notes on your DNA. [Intro Music] Symptoms of long COVID vary 
dramatically between individuals, but depending on who you ask, it’s defined as experiencing 
signs of illness somewhere between 4 weeks and 3 months following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These effects can be devastating, and have dramatic effects on 
a patient's quality of life, including their ability to work. Now, there is a flurry of interest in this topic – which is great! and you can find scientists looking at everything from the heart to the brain to the lungs to the everywhere. But a few research groups are thinking smaller. Way smaller, down to the fine print and the genes that dictate 
our response to infection. While most every cell in your body has the same sequence of DNA in its nucleus, there are a lot of ways for the cell to decide what genes to use when. They don’t all get used the same 
amount, or at the same rate. Think of it like a textbook that 
you don’t read cover to cover. You’re probably going to reference 
some important sections more often, and skip over others that 
are less relevant to you. You might even use sticky notes to mark a page you want to come back to often. Well, cells have their own version of 
sticky notes in their genetic libraries. Genes may get marked up with tags that tell the cell’s machinery to 
use that gene more or less often. This is the basis for the science of epigenetics a way for the cell to modulate genetic information without changing the sequence of DNA. The kind of epigenetic sticky note we’re going to be talking about 
is called DNA methylation. The best-understood version of methylation usually adds a tag to quiet the gene down, causing it to be read out less 
often than it would otherwise. And we have good reason to think the virus that causes COVID-19 may affect epigenetic signals in our cells. Back in 2017, before anyone had ever heard the word “COVID”, researchers were looking into the epigenetic 
effects of SARS and MERS infections, which are both coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. It's unlikely that the virus is moving genetic sticky notes itself  Rather, the thinking seems to be that our own bodies produce more or less of the products of certain genes to make infection less severe. In long COVID, research is starting to suggest that the changes to these signals persist when the body should have scaled 
them back after infection. And here’s the thing – we can read these epigenetic signals. So if we can identify genes whose signals are consistently changed in 
patients with long COVID, we might be able to both 
diagnose long COVID more easily, and shake those genes down for answers about how to treat those patients. A research group based in Sweden has studied DNA methylation in the blood cells of patients with long COVID. In the study, published in the 
journal Clinical Epigenetics in 2022. they found several genes and groups of genes with changes in their methylation after infection. These included some seriously tantalizing hits: genes involved in regulating ACE2, the now-famous protein that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to invade cells. Some genes were also involved 
in histamine signaling, which lines up with the evidence that some antihistamine medications can benefit long COVID patients. Most intriguing, some of these methylated genes were related to taste and smell, which makes sense given that one of COVID’s signature symptoms is loss of those senses. Before we get too excited, though, this was a small study with 
only 10 long COVID patients. So while it isn’t as robust as we would like, that’s unfortunately the case for 
a lot of COVID-related research because it’s just so new. Another research group, this one based in the US, looked at patients recovering from COVID in a pair of papers between 2021 and 2022. They had a total of 102 participants with COVID in their first study, and followed up one year later with 15 of them who reported symptoms of long COVID. They also found changes in DNA methylation that persisted after infection… but in pretty much totally different 
genes than the Swedish study identified. Their previous study had found about 1500 genes whose methylation status changed during acute COVID-19 infection. Of those, 71 remained altered a year later. Broadly speaking, those genes tended to be related to inflammation and response to infection. Basically, a totally different group of genes than what the Swedish team found, although at least some of those 
genes had similar functions. Unfortunately, not all of the studies on 
methylation and long COVID have supported a connection between them. A third study found no difference in methylation between people with long 
COVID and people in remission. These studies were all on the smaller side, with tons of differences between the patients who participated in them. But just for fun, let’s revisit a few of the methylated genes that those studies did find. Because they do all seem relevant to long COVID if larger studies can validate their involvement. For example, the US-based group says that the pattern of 
gene expression they found could help to explain the increase in cardiovascular events that follows COVID-19. And the Swedish group identified 
genes related to ACE2, which interestingly lines 
up with an idea out there that patients develop antibodies to their own ACE2 after infection, which might contribute to 
inflammation occurring in long COVID. Even more interestingly, this group also noticed that their patients had some 
similar self-antibodies floating around to patients with MECFS – what you might know as chronic fatigue syndrome. And they noticed epigenetic changes to 
those self-antibody receptors as well. I don’t want to get too excited 
about such a small study, but the evidence for a link between long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome is piling up everywhere you look. And what’s better than understanding one disease? Understanding two. So while it’s early days for this research, there’s a lot going on in the world 
of COVID-19 epigenetic studies, and studies of COVID-19 in general. But as we discover more about 
how this spiky little virus is messing with our sticky notes, we can hopefully find ways to get 
our DNA textbooks back in order. Which is something that’s worth learning, even if you’re tired of hearing about COVID. This video was made possible thanks to our supporters on Patreon. Our patrons allow us to

them back after infection. And here’s the thing – we can read these epigenetic signals. So if we can identify genes whose signals are consistently changed in 
patients with long COVID, we might be able to both 
diagnose long COVID more easily, and shake those genes down for answers about how to treat those patients. A research group based in Sweden has studied DNA methylation in the blood cells of patients with long COVID. In the study, published in the 
journal Clinical Epigenetics in 2022. they found several genes and groups of genes with changes in their methylation after infection. These included some seriously tantalizing hits: genes involved in regulating ACE2, the now-famous protein that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to invade cells. Some genes were also involved 
in histamine signaling, which lines up with the evidence that some antihistamine medications can benefit long COVID patients. Most intriguing, some of these methylated genes were related to taste and smell, which makes sense given that one of COVID’s signature symptoms is loss of those senses. Before we get too excited, though, this was a small study with 
only 10 long COVID patients. So while it isn’t as robust as we would like, that’s unfortunately the case for 
a lot of COVID-related research because it’s just so new. Another research group, this one based in the US, looked at patients recovering from COVID in a pair of papers between 2021 and 2022. They had a total of 102 participants with COVID in their first study, and followed up one year later with 15 of them who reported symptoms of long COVID. They also found changes in DNA methylation that persisted after infection… but in pretty much totally different 
genes than the Swedish study identified. Their previous study had found about 1500 genes whose methylation status changed during acute COVID-19 infection. Of those, 71 remained altered a year later. Broadly speaking, those genes tended to be related to inflammation and response to infection. Basically, a totally different group of genes than what the Swedish team found, although at least some of those 
genes had similar functions. Unfortunately, not all of the studies on 
methylation and long COVID have supported a connection between them. A third study found no difference in methylation between people with long 
COVID and people in remission. These studies were all on the smaller side, with tons of differences between the patients who participated in them. But just for fun, let’s revisit a few of the methylated genes that those studies did find. Because they do all seem relevant to long COVID if larger studies can validate their involvement. For example, the US-based group says that the pattern of 
gene expression they found could help to explain the increase in cardiovascular events that follows COVID-19. And the Swedish group identified 
genes related to ACE2, which interestingly lines 
up with an idea out there that patients develop antibodies to their own ACE2 after infection, which might contribute to 
inflammation occurring in long COVID. Even more interestingly, this group also noticed that their patients had some 
similar self-antibodies floating around to patients with MECFS – what you might know as chronic fatigue syndrome. And they noticed epigenetic changes to 
those self-antibody receptors as well. I don’t want to get too excited 
about such a small study, but the evidence for a link between long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome is piling up everywhere you look. And what’s better than understanding one disease? Understanding two. So while it’s early days for this research, there’s a lot going on in the world 
of COVID-19 epigenetic studies, and studies of COVID-19 in general. But as we discover more about 
how this spiky little virus is messing with our sticky notes, we can hopefully find ways to get 
our DNA textbooks back in order. Which is something that’s worth learning, even if you’re tired of hearing about COVID. This video was made possible thanks to our supporters on Patreon. Our patrons allow us to

**Transcript**:
I know a lot of us are, like, ignoring COVID now. Sure it’s still a thing out there you can catch, but most people seem tired of hearing about it. But not only is COVID not going anywhere – for some people, infection is followed by a protracted, debilitating condition known 
informally as long COVID. The good news is that scientists 
are hard at work on solving that. And while we don’t know 
what causes long COVID yet, we’re getting closer to 
understanding what’s involved, which points at ways to treat it. Today, let’s talk about one area 
where we’ve made some progress. And it has to do with sticky notes on your DNA. [Intro Music] Symptoms of long COVID vary 
dramatically between individuals, but depending on who you ask, it’s defined as experiencing 
signs of illness somewhere between 4 weeks and 3 months following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These effects can be devastating, and have dramatic effects on 
a patient's quality of life, including their ability to work. Now, there is a flurry of interest in this topic – which is great! and you can find scientists looking at everything from the heart to the brain to the lungs to the everywhere. But a few research groups are thinking smaller. Way smaller, down to the fine print and the genes that dictate 
our response to infection. While most every cell in your body has the same sequence of DNA in its nucleus, there are a lot of ways for the cell to decide what genes to use when. They don’t all get used the same 
amount, or at the same rate. Think of it like a textbook that 
you don’t read cover to cover. You’re probably going to reference 
some important sections more often, and skip over others that 
are less relevant to you. You might even use sticky notes to mark a page you want to come back to often. Well, cells have their own version of 
sticky notes in their genetic libraries. Genes may get marked up with tags that tell the cell’s machinery to 
use that gene more or less often. This is the basis for the science of epigenetics a way for the cell to modulate genetic information without changing the sequence of DNA. The kind of epigenetic sticky note we’re going to be talking about 
is called DNA methylation. The best-understood version of methylation usually adds a tag to quiet the gene down, causing it to be read out less 
often than it would otherwise. And we have good reason to think the virus that causes COVID-19 may affect epigenetic signals in our cells. Back in 2017, before anyone had ever heard the word “COVID”, researchers were looking into the epigenetic 
effects of SARS and MERS infections, which are both coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. It's unlikely that the virus is moving genetic sticky notes itself  Rather, the thinking seems to be that our own bodies produce more or less of the products of certain genes to make infection less severe. In long COVID, research is starting to suggest that the changes to these signals persist when the body should have scaled 
them back after infection. And here’s the thing – we can read these epigenetic signals. So if we can identify genes whose signals are consistently changed in 
patients with long COVID, we might be able to both

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the protein that SARS-CoV-2 uses to invade cells. One of the generated MCQs (Question 4) mentions ACE2, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ, but it does not ask about the protein used by SARS-CoV-2 to invade cells. Instead, it asks about the topic of a research study.

However, I found that Question 5's options and Question 4 do contain relevant information to the ground truth MCQ.

A more relevant generated MCQ is not present, but if I had to choose one, I would say that Question 4 is the most similar, as it mentions ACE2, which is the correct answer to the ground truth MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Over the past two decades, jellyfish
have begun to overwhelm our oceans. In New Zealand, divers swat off millions
of stinging jellyfish each no larger than a grain of pepper. In Sweden, a massive cluster
of moon jellyfish shut down one of the world’s largest
nuclear reactors by clogging the plant’s essential pipes. And in the Sea of Japan, thousands
of 200 kilogram Nomura’s jellyfish with bells two meters in diameter
swarm fishermen, snapping nets and devouring local fish. Around the world, these animals
voraciously consume fish eggs and larvae, routinely undermine
marine farming efforts, and outcompete adult fish by consuming
the resources they need to survive. If things stay on their
current trajectory, we could be headed for a future where
the entire ocean is thick with jellyfish. So, is there anything that can keep these
gelatinous creatures under control? Enter, the humble sea turtle. There are a wide range of marine animals
that feed on jellyfish, but sea turtles are among
their most ancient predators. And while every known species
of sea turtle preys on jellyfish at some point in their lives, none consume quite as many
as the leatherback. Leatherbacks are the largest species
of sea turtle, and they eat jellyfish almost exclusively, devouring well over 1,000 metric tons of
them over their roughly 50-year lifespans. This is particularly remarkable
because jellyfish are 95% water and very low in calories, so to maintain a healthy weight, the average 500 kilogram leatherback needs to eat roughly 400 kilograms
of jellyfish every day. That’s roughly the same weight
as a grand piano. And while some sea turtle species
have been documented selectively eating their preys’
protein-rich gonads, leatherbacks eat jellyfish whole— mowing down huge swaths
of unsuspecting jellies. Normally, jellyfish aren't
quite this defenseless. Most species have tentacles covered
in cells called cnidocytes, which contain venomous harpoons
coiled and ready to launch. These barbed structures, 
known as nematocysts, are released on contact. Jellyfish frequently use this sting
to paralyze and kill their food, and it can also irritate the skin
of would-be intruders. But it's completely useless
against sea turtles. Most of these reptiles have thick
scales covered in keratin— the same material that makes
up nails and claws. This leathery armor protects
their skin while they hunt, and any captured prey that tries
to escape is impaled on the keratinized spikes
lining the leatherback’s esophagus. For most sea turtles, these adaptations
make individual jellyfish easy prey. However, a jelly population’s
true defense mechanism is in how quickly they can reproduce. Almost all jellyfish species have evolved
to reproduce both sexually and asexually, allowing them to increase their numbers
with or without a partner. In tropical environments, jellyfish reproduce constantly
throughout the year. But in more temperate climates, species often reproduce all at once
in a massive bloom, where jellies multiply at alarming rates. And humanity is making these blooms
much more frequent. Fertilizer runoff from farms
introduces chemicals that simultaneously kill other fish
and prompt blooms. High water temperatures
caused by climate change speed up jellyfish reproduction
and extend the reproductive season. Meanwhile, both marine
construction and pollution dramatically increase the surface area
for jellyfish polyps to attach, grow, and mature. All these issues require a wide range
of policy-based solutions. But one major way to prevent jellyfish
populations from getting out of hand is to protect their natural predators— many of whom are currently under threat. Small-scale fisheries that are essential
to communities in Mexico and Peru often use gillnets, which unintentionally capture and kill
hundreds of sea turtles each year. In the Eastern Pacific, these practices
could drive leatherbacks to extinction in the next 60 years. Fortunately, some researchers have already
developed inexpensive tools to minimize these risks. Attaching green LED lights to gillnets
has proven useful for allowing sea turtles, dolphins,
and even seabirds to avoid fishing gear. Solutions like this should 
allow small-scale fishers to support their communities while minimizing their impact
on our leathery ocean defenders.

**Transcript**:
Over the past two decades, jellyfish
have begun to overwhelm our oceans. In New Zealand, divers swat off millions
of stinging jellyfish each no larger than a grain of pepper. In Sweden, a massive cluster
of moon jellyfish shut down one of the world’s largest
nuclear reactors by clogging the plant’s essential pipes. And in the Sea of Japan, thousands
of 200 kilogram Nomura’s jellyfish with bells two meters in diameter
swarm fishermen, snapping nets and devouring local fish. Around the world, these animals
voraciously consume fish eggs and larvae, routinely undermine
marine farming efforts, and outcompete adult fish by consuming
the resources they need to survive. If things stay on their
current trajectory, we could be headed for a future where
the entire ocean is thick with jellyfish. So, is there anything that can keep these
gelatinous creatures under control? Enter, the humble sea turtle. There are a wide range of marine animals
that feed on jellyfish, but sea turtles are among
their most ancient predators. And while every known species
of sea turtle preys on jellyfish at some point in their lives, none consume quite as many
as the leatherback. Leatherbacks are the largest species
of sea turtle, and they eat jellyfish almost exclusively, devouring well over 1,000 metric tons of
them over their roughly 50-year lifespans. This is particularly remarkable
because jellyfish are 95% water and very low in calories, so to maintain a healthy weight, the average 500 kilogram leatherback needs to eat roughly 400 kilograms
of jellyfish every day. That’s roughly the same weight
as a grand piano. And while some sea turtle species
have been documented selectively eating their preys’
protein-rich gonads, leatherbacks eat jellyfish whole— mowing down huge swaths
of unsuspecting jellies. Normally, jellyfish aren't
quite this defenseless. Most species have tentacles covered
in cells called cnidocytes, which contain venomous harpoons
coiled and ready to launch. These barbed structures, 
known as nematocysts, are released on contact. Jellyfish frequently use this sting
to paralyze and kill their food, and it can also irritate the skin
of would-be intruders. But it's completely useless
against sea turtles. Most of these reptiles have thick
scales covered in keratin— the same material that makes
up nails and claws. This leathery armor protects
their skin while they hunt, and any captured prey that tries
to escape is impaled on the keratinized spikes
lining the leatherback’s esophagus. For most sea turtles, these adaptations
make individual jellyfish easy prey. However, a jelly population’s
true defense mechanism is in how quickly they can reproduce. Almost all jellyfish species have evolved
to reproduce both sexually and asexually, allowing them to increase their numbers
with or without a partner. In tropical environments, jellyfish reproduce constantly
throughout the year. But in more temperate climates, species often reproduce all at once
in a massive bloom, where jellies multiply at alarming rates. And humanity is making these blooms
much more frequent. Fertilizer runoff from farms
introduces chemicals that simultaneously kill other fish
and prompt blooms. High water temperatures
caused by climate change speed up jellyfish reproduction
and extend the reproductive season. Meanwhile, both marine
construction and pollution dramatically increase the surface area
for jellyfish polyps to attach, grow, and mature. All these issues require a wide range
of policy-based solutions. But one major way to prevent jellyfish

**Transcript**:
It's 5000 BCE in the verdant
swamps of North America, and this young deer has
no idea it’s being hunted. Suddenly, an alligator hurtles out of the
water at almost 50 kilometers an hour, locking its jaws around its prey and swinging wildly in a signature move
known as the death roll. This deer never stood a chance, but then, nothing in this region can
compete with this apex predator. These alligators easily devour
the birds, turtles, and small fish living in what’s known today
as Everglades National Park. But despite ruling the swamp
for millennia, the last 500 years have brought
deadly new predators that challenge the alligators’ reign. And the origins of these international
invaders are just as unexpected as their impact on the Everglades. We tend to think of swamps
as hostile landscapes since they’re overflowing
with plant and animal life. But all this biodiversity makes these
environments vital to regional food webs. And the Everglades are no exception. The park's subtropical climate can support
species from around the world, and its borders are full of ecotones—
transition areas between habitats— that connect the region’s
freshwater prairies, rocky pinelands, mangrove forests,
and more. Human activity has made the region
even more biodiverse, developing Florida into a major port that welcomes countless human
and non-human migrants. In the 1500s, Spanish colonizers
brought wild boar to the area, which quickly multiplied
and uprooted the wetlands. They devoured alligator eggs and spread
European parasites to local panthers. Then, in the 1800s,
Florida’s shipping industry exploded, bringing all manner
of new invasive species. Brazilian peppertrees blocked out the sun,
water hyacinths clogged the rivers, and brown anole lizards
upset the food chain. Alligator populations mostly
endured this onslaught, but in the late 19th century, human intervention kicked
things up a notch. Government and business officials wanted
to turn the Everglades into farmland and began building canals
to drain the swamp. They also planted non-native trees
which crowded out the plants local birds relied on for
food and shelter, which in turn limited
the alligators’ supply of prey. Interventions like this wreaked havoc
on the Everglades for decades, until a conservationist named 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas finally came to their defense. In 1947, Douglas published a landmark book
explaining that the Everglades were not only a unique
and precious ecosystem, but that the region’s most fearsome
residents were actually vital to sustaining it. During the wet season, alligators are constantly shaping
the muddy landscape, drawing lines with their bodies and digging holes
with their snouts, claws, and tails. In the dry season, these indentations become essential
watering holes and firebreaks, maintaining and protecting
the swamp’s other residents. In the wake of Douglas’ book,
Everglades National Park was established to formally begin protecting
the landscape and its scaly stewards. But outside the park, conditions were brewing
for the most dangerous invasion yet. Over the next 40 years,
the exotic pet trade brought parakeets, iguanas,
and relatives of piranhas to the region. In the 1990s, Burmese pythons became
a cheap, popular pet for many Floridians. Some snake owners released their pets
into the wild when they grew too large. But the python population
really exploded in 1992 when a hurricane destroyed
a breeding facility and released countless snakes
into the wild. Since then, pythons have been
connected to a 90% decrease in some local mammal populations, decimating the alligators’ food supply. And with help from other invasive
reptiles like black and white tegus— giant lizards who devour alligator eggs— these snakes have made a serious play
for the top of the local food chain. Today, Florida ranks among the regions
with the most invasive species in the world. Some researchers suggest
hunting these invaders down, while others recommend bringing in yet
more creatures to balance the scales, such as releasing insects
to eat invasive plants. It might seem absurd to try solving
this problem with more foreign fauna. But perhaps a new arrival could
fight invaders and feed the alligators— giving them the boost they need
to reclaim their ancient home.

**Transcript**:
It's 5000 BCE in the verdant
swamps of North America, and this young deer has
no idea it’s being hunted. Suddenly, an alligator hurtles out of the
water at almost 50 kilometers an hour, locking its jaws around its prey and swinging wildly in a signature move
known as the death roll. This deer never stood a chance, but then, nothing in this region can
compete with this apex predator. These alligators easily devour
the birds, turtles, and small fish living in what’s known today
as Everglades National Park. But despite ruling the swamp
for millennia, the last 500 years have brought
deadly new predators that challenge the alligators’ reign. And the origins of these international
invaders are just as unexpected as their impact on the Everglades. We tend to think of swamps
as hostile landscapes since they’re overflowing
with plant and animal life. But all this biodiversity makes these
environments vital to regional food webs. And the Everglades are no exception. The park's subtropical climate can support
species from around the world, and its borders are full of ecotones—
transition areas between habitats— that connect the region’s
freshwater prairies, rocky pinelands, mangrove forests,
and more. Human activity has made the region
even more biodiverse, developing Florida into a major port that welcomes countless human
and non-human migrants. In the 1500s, Spanish colonizers
brought wild boar to the area, which quickly multiplied
and uprooted the wetlands. They devoured alligator eggs and spread
European parasites to local panthers. Then, in the 1800s,
Florida’s shipping industry exploded, bringing all manner
of new invasive species. Brazilian peppertrees blocked out the sun,
water hyacinths clogged the rivers, and brown anole lizards
upset the food chain. Alligator populations mostly
endured this onslaught, but in the late 19th century, human intervention kicked
things up a notch. Government and business officials wanted
to turn the Everglades into farmland and began building canals
to drain the swamp. They also planted non-native trees
which crowded out the plants local birds relied on for
food and shelter, which in turn limited
the alligators’ supply of prey. Interventions like this wreaked havoc
on the Everglades for decades, until a conservationist named 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas finally came to their defense. In 1947, Douglas published a landmark book
explaining that the Everglades were not only a unique
and precious ecosystem, but that the region’s most fearsome
residents were actually vital to sustaining it. During the wet season, alligators are constantly shaping
the muddy landscape, drawing lines with their bodies and digging holes
with their snouts, claws, and tails. In the dry season, these indentations become essential
watering holes and firebreaks, maintaining and protecting
the swamp’s other residents. In the wake of Douglas’ book,
Everglades National Park was established to formally begin protecting
the landscape and its scaly stewards. But outside the park, conditions were brewing
for the most dangerous invasion yet. Over the next 40 years,
the exotic pet trade brought parakeets, iguanas,
and relatives of piranhas to the region. In the 1990s, Burmese pythons became
a cheap, popular pet for many Floridians. Some snake owners released their pets
into the wild when they grew too large. But the python population
really exploded in 1992 when a hurricane destroyed
a breeding facility and released countless snakes
into the wild. Since then, pythons have been
connected to a 90% decrease in some local mammal populations, decimating the alligators’ food supply. And with help from other invasive
reptiles like black and white tegus— giant lizards who devour alligator eggs— these snakes have made a serious play
for the top of the local food chain. Today, Florida ranks among the regions
with the most invasive species in the world. Some researchers suggest
hunting these invaders down, while others recommend bringing in yet
more creatures to balance the scales, such as releasing insects
to eat invasive plants. It might seem absurd to try solving
this problem with more foreign fauna. But perhaps a new arrival could
fight invaders and feed the alligators— giving them the boost they need
to reclaim their ancient home.

Matching Response:
The generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ is not explicitly present in the provided set. However, based on the question intent, options, and content, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat similar.

The ground truth MCQ asks about a plant that clogged some of Florida's rivers. Among the generated MCQs, Question 11 mentions the impact of Spanish colonizers, which includes the introduction of wild boar, but it does not directly address the question about plants.

However, Question 6 mentions "clogging the rivers with water hyacinths" as an incorrect option. Although this question does not directly ask about the plant that clogged the rivers, it does mention water hyacinths, which is the correct answer in the ground truth MCQ.

Given the available options, I would suggest that Question 6 is the most similar generated MCQ, although it does not perfectly match the ground truth MCQ.

water hyacinths clogged the rivers, and brown anole lizards
upset the food chain. Alligator populations mostly
endured this onslaught, but in the late 19th century, human intervention kicked
things up a notch. Government and business officials wanted
to turn the Everglades into farmland and began building canals
to drain the swamp. They also planted non-native trees
which crowded out the plants local birds relied on for
food and shelter, which in turn limited
the alligators’ supply of prey. Interventions like this wreaked havoc
on the Everglades for decades, until a conservationist named 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas finally came to their defense. In 1947, Douglas published a landmark book
explaining that the Everglades were not only a unique
and precious ecosystem, but that the region’s most fearsome
residents were actually vital to sustaining it. During the wet season, alligators are constantly shaping
the muddy landscape, drawing lines with their bodies and digging holes
with their snouts, claws, and tails. In the dry season, these indentations become essential
watering holes and firebreaks, maintaining and protecting
the swamp’s other residents. In the wake of Douglas’ book,
Everglades National Park was established to formally begin protecting
the landscape and its scaly stewards. But outside the park, conditions were brewing
for the most dangerous invasion yet. Over the next 40 years,
the exotic pet trade brought parakeets, iguanas,
and relatives of piranhas to the region. In the 1990s, Burmese pythons became
a cheap, popular pet for many Floridians. Some snake owners released their pets
into the wild when they grew too large. But the python population
really exploded in 1992 when a hurricane destroyed
a breeding facility and released countless snakes
into the wild. Since then, pythons have been
connected to a 90% decrease in some local mammal populations, decimating the alligators’ food supply. And with help from other invasive
reptiles like black and white tegus— giant lizards who devour alligator eggs— these snakes have made a serious play
for the top of the local food chain. Today, Florida ranks among the regions
with the most invasive species in the world. Some researchers suggest
hunting these invaders down, while others recommend bringing in yet
more creatures to balance the scales, such as releasing insects
to eat invasive plants. It might seem absurd to try solving
this problem with more foreign fauna. But perhaps a new arrival could
fight invaders and feed the alligators— giving them the boost they need
to reclaim their ancient home.

Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 2021, a survey of over 1,000 Americans
found that nearly two-thirds had eaten plant-based meat alternatives
in the past year. Many cited potential health
and environmental benefits as their motivation. But are these alternative meats actually
better for us and the planet? First, let’s introduce the contenders. Meat from butchered animals,
which we’ll call farmed meat, is a complex structure of muscle fibers,
connective tissues, and fat. You may recognize meat
from its role in the human diet, stretching back to our species’
very beginnings. Our next challenger, 
the plant-based meat alternative, may look and taste like meat, but it’s built with proteins,
carbohydrates, fats, and other molecules from plants. Transforming plant molecules
into something that resembles meat takes effort. Meat’s fibrous texture is created
by long rod-like proteins. To replicate this structure, a plant’s ball-shaped proteins can be
pushed through an extruder device which forces them to unwind
and join into long filaments. To mimic animal fat, companies mix
in fats and oils extracted from plants. One popular brand adds
a beet juice pigment that changes the patty’s color
as it cooks. Another adds an iron-containing molecule
called heme, which their team says
is key to its meaty flavor. The resulting products come in many forms. Finally, our last entrant:
lab-grown meat. Also known as cell-based meat
and cultured meat, these products begin as animal stem cells that researchers coax to multiply
and form into muscle. It’s worth noting that lab-grown meats
are largely still in development, so the exact process may change
when they’re produced at greater commercial scale. So which meat or lookalike
is best for your health? Farmed meat is a vital source of protein
and nutrients for many people. But researchers have also found links
between diets high in red and processed meats and health concerns like
type 2 diabetes and heart disease. One 2012 study concluded
that swapping red meat for other options like chicken, nuts,
or legumes for one meal a day can potentially reduce mortality risk
by 7 to 19%. There is not enough data to know
whether replacing red meat with a plant-based patty
would have the same effect. Plant-based meats, while containing
just as much protein, calories, and iron as farmed meat, are highly processed and, therefore,
high in sodium. And many contain coconut oil,
which has a lot of saturated fat, and, like red meat,
may elevate heart disease risk. Lab-grown meat, meanwhile, has the potential to offer the same
nutritional qualities and health risks as farmed meat. But we won’t know for sure until
product development is further along. So which contender is better
for the environment? Animal agriculture generates
an estimated 14.5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that producing
plant-based meat substitutes results in, on average, around 90% less
greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent amount of beef, 63% less than pork,
and 51% less than poultry. Plant-based meat alternatives also tend
to require far less land and water than farmed meat. And their production results in much lower
levels of pollutants running off farms and entering waterways— which threaten both the environment
and public health. As for lab-grown meat, today the industry largely takes
its stem cells from the muscle tissue of livestock. But how many animals will be required
for these biopsies once production scales up? It also isn’t clear to what degree
alternative meats will reduce the environmental impact
of the farmed meats industry. What if, instead of replacing
meat with alternatives, people continue to consume
the same amount of farmed meat while also eating newer options? While the verdict is still out on which
meat is nutritionally superior, if you care about your personal
impact on animal welfare, public health, and the environment, plant-based meat tends to come out on top. And switching to meat alternatives doesn’t
have to be an all-or-nothing decision. In fact, a 2022 study estimated that
forgoing red meat at just one meal a day can decrease your personal dietary
carbon emissions by as much as 48%.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs exactly match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of plant-based meat alternatives.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the name of the iron-containing molecule that adds meat-like flavor to plant-based meats. While none of the generated MCQs ask about this specific topic, Question 3 mentions lab-grown meat being made from animal stem cells, and Question 5 discusses a potential drawback of plant-based meat alternatives.

However, if I had to choose a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the topic of plant-based meat alternatives, I would suggest Question 5. Nevertheless, I must emphasize that Question 5 does not match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, or content.

Since there isn't a matching generated MCQ, I will not provide an index. Instead, I suggest creating a new generated MCQ that specifically asks about the iron-containing molecule that adds meat-like flavor to plant-based meats, with options that include "Heme" as the correct answer.

If you would like, I can help you create a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ.

found that nearly two-thirds had eaten plant-based meat alternatives
in the past year. Many cited potential health
and environmental benefits as their motivation. But are these alternative meats actually
better for us and the planet? First, let’s introduce the contenders. Meat from butchered animals,
which we’ll call farmed meat, is a complex structure of muscle fibers,
connective tissues, and fat. You may recognize meat
from its role in the human diet, stretching back to our species’
very beginnings. Our next challenger, 
the plant-based meat alternative, may look and taste like meat, but it’s built with proteins,
carbohydrates, fats, and other molecules from plants. Transforming plant molecules
into something that resembles meat takes effort. Meat’s fibrous texture is created
by long rod-like proteins. To replicate this structure, a plant’s ball-shaped proteins can be
pushed through an extruder device which forces them to unwind
and join into long filaments. To mimic animal fat, companies mix
in fats and oils extracted from plants. One popular brand adds
a beet juice pigment that changes the patty’s color
as it cooks. Another adds an iron-containing molecule
called heme, which their team says
is key to its meaty flavor. The resulting products come in many forms. Finally, our last entrant:
lab-grown meat. Also known as cell-based meat
and cultured meat, these products begin as animal stem cells that researchers coax to multiply
and form into muscle. It’s worth noting that lab-grown meats
are largely still in development, so the exact process may change
when they’re produced at greater commercial scale. So which meat or lookalike
is best for your health? Farmed meat is a vital source of protein
and nutrients for many people. But researchers have also found links
between diets high in red and processed meats and health concerns like
type 2 diabetes and heart disease. One 2012 study concluded
that swapping red meat for other options like chicken, nuts,
or legumes for one meal a day can potentially reduce mortality risk
by 7 to 19%. There is not enough data to know
whether replacing red meat with a plant-based patty
would have the same effect. Plant-based meats, while containing
just as much protein, calories, and iron as farmed meat, are highly processed and, therefore,
high in sodium. And many contain coconut oil,
which has a lot of saturated fat, and, like red meat,
may elevate heart disease risk. Lab-grown meat, meanwhile, has the potential to offer the same
nutritional qualities and health risks as farmed meat. But we won’t know for sure until
product development is further along. So which contender is better
for the environment? Animal agriculture generates
an estimated 14.5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that producing
plant-based meat substitutes results in, on average, around 90% less
greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent amount of beef, 63% less than pork,
and 51% less than poultry. Plant-based meat alternatives also tend
to require far less land and water than farmed meat. And their production results in much lower
levels of pollutants running off farms and entering waterways— which threaten both the environment
and public health. As for lab-grown meat, today the industry largely takes
its stem cells from the muscle tissue of livestock. But how many animals will be required
for these biopsies once production scales up? It also isn’t clear to what degree
alternative meats will reduce the environmental impact
of the farmed meats industry. What if, instead of replacing
meat with alternatives, people continue to consume
the same amount of farmed meat while also eating newer options? While the verdict is still out on which
meat is nutritionally superior, if you care about your personal
impact on animal welfare, public health, and the environment, plant-based meat tends to come out on top. And switching to meat alternatives doesn’t
have to be an all-or-nothing decision. In fact, a 2022 study estimated that
forgoing red meat at just one meal a day can decrease your personal dietary
carbon emissions by as much as 48%.

**Transcript**:
On September 19th, 1991,
two hikers traversing the Ötzal Alps on the border of Austria and Italy
discovered a corpse emerging from the ice. Researchers soon realized they weren’t
looking at the victim of a recent climbing accident,
as initially assumed, but the mummified body of a man
who’d lived about 5,300 years ago, who they came to call Ötzi the Iceman. One early theory for Ötzi’s alpine death
was that he was a local shepherd or hunter who got caught in bad weather and froze. However, a shocking discovery eventually
revealed his true cause of death and upended his story. So, what do we know about Ötzi? And how did he die? Over the millennia, the Alpine cold 
and sun protected Ötzi’s body from decomposition, 
freezing and drying it out in cycles, and leaving critical clues
for researchers. Ötzi was about 160 centimeters tall,
weighed some 50 kilograms, and died between 40- and 50-years-old. He led an active life but had
a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular diseases. His intestines were also parasitized
by whipworms and his stomach contained
ulcer-causing bacteria, all of which might have caused
some unpleasant symptoms. He died hundreds of years before
Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid were constructed, around 3350 BCE. Ötzi lived during the late
Neolithic Copper Age, when metal extraction
and crafting practices were spreading throughout Eurasia. Indeed, along with stone arrowheads
and knives, Ötzi carried an axe made of copper
from what is now Tuscany. Swaths of his clothing were made
of sheep and goat leather, and his diet included cultivated grains, all of which suggested that Ötzi’s people
relied on certain domesticated animals and crops. And when researchers 
inspected Ötzi’s skin with light ranging from infrared to UV, they found a total of 61 tattoos. Interestingly, the markings corresponded
with areas of Ötzi’s body where he probably experienced pain, like from degeneration observed
in his knees, ankles, and spine. Researchers think that the tattoos
might have been intended as treatment— perhaps an early form of acupuncture. Close scrutiny also clarified
the circumstances of Ötzi’s death— and led to a tantalizing prehistoric
murder mystery. A decade into studying Ötzi,
a CT scan picked up a crucial detail: there was a flint arrowhead lodged
in Ötzi’s left shoulder. Soon enough, researchers started piecing
Ötzi’s final days together. A deep cut wound on Ötzi’s hand
showed initial signs of healing and must have occurred
just days before his death. It was likely a defensive wound
which indicated that Ötzi was attacked with a sharp blade
but fought back and survived. Ötzi may have dressed
the wound with bog moss, which has antiseptic properties
and was found with his remains. Meanwhile, the types and location
of pollen in Ötzi’s digestive tract indicated that it was spring
or early summer and that his last three days were hectic. Ötzi seemed to be fleeing something. About 33 hours before his death, Ötzi was at an altitude
of around 2,500 meters, near the timber line. Then, approximately 24 hours later, he descended to at least 1,200 meters,
to a zone of warmth-loving trees. In his final hours, Ötzi reached
an altitude of around 3,000 meters where grasses, sedges,
and certain wildflowers dominated. His last meal included a large helping
of dried wild ibex, roe deer, and grains. Then, despite Ötzi’s apparent efforts
to escape the conflict, someone at a distant vantage
shot him from behind. The arrow pierced a major artery
and embedded itself in his left shoulder, causing extensive blood loss. Ötzi probably died soon after, his remains and all his belongings left
undisturbed in the glacier for millennia. This 5,300-year-old cold case has offered
invaluable glimpses into the distant past. But the mystery of who exactly Ötzi was
and why he was killed will probably never be solved— the tangible evidence for the act
degraded and carried away, lost to snow drifts long ago.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs directly match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question content and options. However, I can suggest a generated MCQ that is somewhat related to the ground truth MCQ.

The ground truth MCQ asks about the time period in which Ötzi lived, and the correct option is the Copper Age. Among the generated MCQs, Question 2 mentions Ötzi's occupation according to early researchers, which includes the option "hunter" or "shepherd." However, this question does not directly relate to the time period.

A more relevant generated MCQ would be one that mentions the Copper Age or a related concept. Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs directly mention the Copper Age. However, I can suggest Question 1 as a distant match, as it mentions Ötzi's age at the time of death, which is related to the time period in which he lived.

A better match would be a generated MCQ that asks about Ötzi's tools, clothing, or other aspects of his life that are related to the Copper Age. Unfortunately, such a question is not present among the generated MCQs.

Given the available options, I would suggest Question 2 as a very distant match, but I must emphasize that it does not directly match the ground truth MCQ.

However, I noticed that the transcript mentions the Copper Age in the following sentence:

"Ötzi lived during the late Neolithic Copper Age, when metal extraction and crafting practices were spreading throughout Eurasia."

If I were to generate a new MCQ based on this sentence, it would be:

Question: During which age did Ötzi live, when metal extraction and crafting practices were spreading throughout Eurasia?
Options: A. Iron Age, B. Copper Age, C. Bronze Age, D. Middle Ages
Correct Option: B

This new MCQ would be a direct match for the ground truth MCQ.

Since I need to provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ, I will choose Question 2, but I want to emphasize that it is a very distant match.

**Transcript**:
On September 19th, 1991,
two hikers traversing the Ötzal Alps on the border of Austria and Italy
discovered a corpse emerging from the ice. Researchers soon realized they weren’t
looking at the victim of a recent climbing accident,
as initially assumed, but the mummified body of a man
who’d lived about 5,300 years ago, who they came to call Ötzi the Iceman. One early theory for Ötzi’s alpine death
was that he was a local shepherd or hunter who got caught in bad weather and froze. However, a shocking discovery eventually
revealed his true cause of death and upended his story. So, what do we know about Ötzi? And how did he die? Over the millennia, the Alpine cold 
and sun protected Ötzi’s body from decomposition, 
freezing and drying it out in cycles, and leaving critical clues
for researchers. Ötzi was about 160 centimeters tall,
weighed some 50 kilograms, and died between 40- and 50-years-old. He led an active life but had
a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular diseases. His intestines were also parasitized
by whipworms and his stomach contained
ulcer-causing bacteria, all of which might have caused
some unpleasant symptoms. He died hundreds of years before
Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid were constructed, around 3350 BCE. Ötzi lived during the late
Neolithic Copper Age, when metal extraction
and crafting practices were spreading throughout Eurasia. Indeed, along with stone arrowheads
and knives, Ötzi carried an axe made of copper
from what is now Tuscany. Swaths of his clothing were made
of sheep and goat leather, and his diet included cultivated grains, all of which suggested that Ötzi’s people
relied on certain domesticated animals and crops. And when researchers 
inspected Ötzi’s skin with light ranging from infrared to UV, they found a total of 61 tattoos. Interestingly, the markings corresponded
with areas of Ötzi’s body where he probably experienced pain, like from degeneration observed
in his knees, ankles, and spine. Researchers think that the tattoos
might have been intended as treatment— perhaps an early form of acupuncture. Close scrutiny also clarified
the circumstances of Ötzi’s death— and led to a tantalizing prehistoric
murder mystery. A decade into studying Ötzi,
a CT scan picked up a crucial detail: there was a flint arrowhead lodged
in Ötzi’s left shoulder. Soon enough, researchers started piecing
Ötzi’s final days together. A deep cut wound on Ötzi’s hand
showed initial signs of healing and must have occurred
just days before his death. It was likely a defensive wound
which indicated that Ötzi was attacked with a sharp blade
but fought back and survived. Ötzi may have dressed
the wound with bog moss, which has antiseptic properties
and was found with his remains. Meanwhile, the types and location
of pollen in Ötzi’s digestive tract indicated that it was spring
or early summer and that his last three days were hectic. Ötzi seemed to be fleeing something. About 33 hours before his death, Ötzi was at an altitude
of around 2,500 meters, near the timber line. Then, approximately 24 hours later, he descended to at least 1,200 meters,
to a zone of warmth-loving trees. In his final hours, Ötzi reached
an altitude of around 3,000 meters where grasses, sedges,
and certain wildflowers dominated. His last meal included a large helping
of dried wild ibex, roe deer, and grains. Then, despite Ötzi’s apparent efforts
to escape the conflict, someone at a distant vantage
shot him from behind. The arrow pierced a major artery
and embedded itself in his left shoulder, causing extensive blood loss. Ötzi probably died soon after, his remains and all his belongings left
undisturbed in the glacier for millennia. This 5,300-year-old cold case has offered
invaluable glimpses into the distant past. But the mystery of who exactly Ötzi was
and why he was killed will probably never be solved— the tangible evidence for the act
degraded and carried away, lost to snow drifts long ago.

**Transcript**:
A tennis player wins
her second straight set, feeling like she can predict
her opponent's next move. A musician works to master
a chord progression, unfazed by mistakes as he repeatedly
plays the same four bars. A scientist fails to notice her morning
alarm blare from the next room, having analyzed data through the night. While each of these people is immersed
in a different activity, requiring specific skills
and knowledge sets, all three are experiencing
what is known as flow— a unique mental state
of effortless engagement. And while you may not be a scientist
or professional athlete, anyone can find flow. This is a good thing, as those who more frequently 
experience flow report higher levels of positive emotions, creativity,
and feelings of accomplishment. Further, research has linked it
to increased productivity, enhanced learning,
and academic achievement. But what exactly is flow?
And how can we find it in our daily lives? Flow is more than just concentrating
or paying attention. Psychologists go so far as to define flow
as an altered state of consciousness with several defining features. First, those in flow tend to feel
so effortlessly engaged in a task that time seems to fly by. They are not easily distracted. In contrast with cycles
of procrastination, when it can feel impossible
to start an activity, during flow it can feel difficult to stop. Flow also tends to diminish feelings
of worry or self-judgment, in turn fostering creativity. And people report experiencing a sense
of oneness with what they’re doing, allowing for peak performance. Further, brain imaging studies have shown
that flow is accompanied by changes in neural activity, notably in regions that play a role in attention, self-awareness,
and self-consciousness. Despite decades of research, 
many questions still remain. How do the brains of those in flow compare to those in other states of consciousness,
like meditation? Does flow arising from physical
activities like sports recruit the same brain areas
as more mental tasks like writing or math? And scientists are still working
to understand why certain activities are more likely to elicit flow
than others. While we don't know for sure,
there are several theories. For example, people more often report
finding flow when doing things they find intrinsically motivating, meaning activities they find purpose,
meaning, or enjoyment in. This may include participating
in a favorite hobby, but also tackling gratifying
assignments at work, studying topics you find interesting,
or even completing satisfying chores. Likewise, it may be more difficult
to find flow in tasks you do only because you have to, 
not because you want to. Other research suggests balancing
personal skill level with the activity’s challenge
is key for finding flow. In other words, if a task is too easy,
you may get distracted or feel bored. If it’s too challenging,
you may become discouraged. The classically mesmerizing game
of Tetris, for example, keeps skill-challenge levels in balance
by increasing the fall speed of blocks as players get better at the game. Still, other studies suggest 
that it’s most important that activities have clear goals and allow you to assess
your progress along the way. For example, practicing a song allows
you to gauge your performance with each note. This also may be why people find
flow when playing games of chance, even though those games
don't require skill. Moment-to-moment feedback may be enough
to motivate deep engagement. While no single protocol
can guarantee flow, there are steps you can take
to increase your chances. Find a quiet environment free
from distracting noises or devices. Break your tasks into small, specific
segments that are easy to track and learn from. Set clear end goals that are
challenging but not frustratingly so. If you find the task to be tedious, set additional parameters
to up the stakes. For example, when cleaning your dishes, attempt to finish them all
in a certain amount of time. When running, try to keep pace
with the beat of a song. Most importantly,
and perhaps most frustratingly, don't focus too much on reaching flow. That sort of distraction might just
prevent you from finding it.

**Transcript**:
A tennis player wins
her second straight set, feeling like she can predict
her opponent's next move. A musician works to master
a chord progression, unfazed by mistakes as he repeatedly
plays the same four bars. A scientist fails to notice her morning
alarm blare from the next room, having analyzed data through the night. While each of these people is immersed
in a different activity, requiring specific skills
and knowledge sets, all three are experiencing
what is known as flow— a unique mental state
of effortless engagement. And while you may not be a scientist
or professional athlete, anyone can find flow. This is a good thing, as those who more frequently 
experience flow report higher levels of positive emotions, creativity,
and feelings of accomplishment. Further, research has linked it
to increased productivity, enhanced learning,
and academic achievement. But what exactly is flow?
And how can we find it in our daily lives? Flow is more than just concentrating
or paying attention. Psychologists go so far as to define flow
as an altered state of consciousness with several defining features. First, those in flow tend to feel
so effortlessly engaged in a task that time seems to fly by. They are not easily distracted. In contrast with cycles
of procrastination, when it can feel impossible
to start an activity, during flow it can feel difficult to stop. Flow also tends to diminish feelings
of worry or self-judgment, in turn fostering creativity. And people report experiencing a sense
of oneness with what they’re doing, allowing for peak performance. Further, brain imaging studies have shown
that flow is accompanied by changes in neural activity, notably in regions that play a role in attention, self-awareness,
and self-consciousness. Despite decades of research, 
many questions still remain. How do the brains of those in flow compare to those in other states of consciousness,
like meditation? Does flow arising from physical
activities like sports recruit the same brain areas
as more mental tasks like writing or math? And scientists are still working
to understand why certain activities are more likely to elicit flow
than others. While we don't know for sure,
there are several theories. For example, people more often report
finding flow when doing things they find intrinsically motivating, meaning activities they find purpose,
meaning, or enjoyment in. This may include participating
in a favorite hobby, but also tackling gratifying
assignments at work, studying topics you find interesting,
or even completing satisfying chores. Likewise, it may be more difficult
to find flow in tasks you do only because you have to, 
not because you want to. Other research suggests balancing
personal skill level with the activity’s challenge
is key for finding flow. In other words, if a task is too easy,
you may get distracted or feel bored. If it’s too challenging,
you may become discouraged. The classically mesmerizing game
of Tetris, for example, keeps skill-challenge levels in balance
by increasing the fall speed of blocks as players get better at the game. Still, other studies suggest 
that it’s most important that activities have clear goals and allow you to assess
your progress along the way. For example, practicing a song allows
you to gauge your performance with each note. This also may be why people find
flow when playing games of chance, even though those games
don't require skill. Moment-to-moment feedback may be enough
to motivate deep engagement. While no single protocol
can guarantee flow, there are steps you can take
to increase your chances. Find a quiet environment free
from distracting noises or devices. Break your tasks into small, specific
segments that are easy to track and learn from. Set clear end goals that are
challenging but not frustratingly so. If you find the task to be tedious, set additional parameters
to up the stakes. For example, when cleaning your dishes, attempt to finish them all
in a certain amount of time. When running, try to keep pace
with the beat of a song. Most importantly,
and perhaps most frustratingly, don't focus too much on reaching flow. That sort of distraction might just
prevent you from finding it.

**Transcript**:
From the 1930s well into the 1960s, pregnancy testing required a slippery
piece of equipment: a female African clawed frog. For decades, hospitals and research labs
around the world had a trusted supply of these
handy amphibians, employing their help
in testing for pregnancy and in numerous other
scientific endeavors. So, what makes these phenomenal frogs
so special? The remarkable features
of the African clawed frog have fascinated researchers
since the 19th century. We often think of frogs as hopping
around to snatch up bugs with their lengthy tongues. But this water-dwelling species
is almost exclusively aquatic, having adapted primarily for swimming
rather than crawling or jumping. Weirder still, African clawed frogs
have no tongues at all. Instead, they suck food directly
into their mouths or use their hands to catch larger animals which they tear apart
with powerful hind claws. To help get close to their prey, their smooth skin can quickly change color
to blend into their surroundings. This camouflage ability was particularly
interesting to a trio of biologists in South Africa during the 1920s. Hillel Shapiro, Harry Zwarenstein,
and their teacher, Lancelot Hogben, were researching what role
the pituitary gland, a small region of the frog’s brain, might play in the
color changing mechanism. Removing the gland altogether impaired
the frogs’ ability to camouflage. But when Hogben injected them with
a pituitary extract derived from an ox, he found an even more surprising result— the frogs began laying eggs. Normally, African clawed frogs
only release eggs when a male frog is
nearby to fertilize them. But this ox hormone triggered their
ovulation without the presence of a male. And this process gave
the researchers an idea. They knew there was a chemical similarity
between the ox hormone and a hormone found in the urine
of pregnant people— a compound we know today as the
chorionic gonadotropin hormone, or hCG. In pregnancy tests of the day, animals like mice and rabbits were
injected with human urine as a way of testing
for the presence of hCG. However, this required multiple
days of injections, as well as killing and dissecting
the animals to see whether the hormone was present. Because of these hurdles, the test was
reserved for specific use cases, leaving most people waiting for visible
signs to determine if they were pregnant. But these frogs changed everything. They responded to hCG in roughly 9 hours
with no need for dissection. And since their large ovaries
constantly generate eggs, they could participate in numerous tests
over their 15 to 30 year lifespan. Better still, these frogs were abundant
in their native habitat, making them easy to find,
catch, and export. Before long, tens of thousands
of African clawed frogs were being shipped to hospitals
all over the world, making reliable pregnancy tests
widely available for the first time. In the 1970s, the frogs would be
superseded by chemical tests that detected hCG directly. But by then their widespread presence
in laboratories had made African clawed frogs
the star of numerous studies. Their rapid development and ability
to produce eggs in any season made them invaluable models
for developmental biology. African clawed frogs have even been
part of biological studies aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. However,
frogs can be slippery subjects. More than a few of these amphibians have
escaped their laboratory enclosures, and in many places, their ferocious appetite allowed them
to outcompete native amphibians. To make matters worse, they often carry a deadly
fungus called chytrid, which can cause an infection
that lethally disrupts the delicate functioning
of amphibian skin. In the 20th century, this fungal infection
has devastated amphibian populations around the globe, causing the extinction
of multiple frog species. Because of all these concerns, the African clawed frog is now classified
as an invasive species, and illegal in many regions. So in the end, like other pregnancy tests, the use of these frogs
in scientific research has had both
positive and negative results.

**Transcript**:
From the 1930s well into the 1960s, pregnancy testing required a slippery
piece of equipment: a female African clawed frog. For decades, hospitals and research labs
around the world had a trusted supply of these
handy amphibians, employing their help
in testing for pregnancy and in numerous other
scientific endeavors. So, what makes these phenomenal frogs
so special? The remarkable features
of the African clawed frog have fascinated researchers
since the 19th century. We often think of frogs as hopping
around to snatch up bugs with their lengthy tongues. But this water-dwelling species
is almost exclusively aquatic, having adapted primarily for swimming
rather than crawling or jumping. Weirder still, African clawed frogs
have no tongues at all. Instead, they suck food directly
into their mouths or use their hands to catch larger animals which they tear apart
with powerful hind claws. To help get close to their prey, their smooth skin can quickly change color
to blend into their surroundings. This camouflage ability was particularly
interesting to a trio of biologists in South Africa during the 1920s. Hillel Shapiro, Harry Zwarenstein,
and their teacher, Lancelot Hogben, were researching what role
the pituitary gland, a small region of the frog’s brain, might play in the
color changing mechanism. Removing the gland altogether impaired
the frogs’ ability to camouflage. But when Hogben injected them with
a pituitary extract derived from an ox, he found an even more surprising result— the frogs began laying eggs. Normally, African clawed frogs
only release eggs when a male frog is
nearby to fertilize them. But this ox hormone triggered their
ovulation without the presence of a male. And this process gave
the researchers an idea. They knew there was a chemical similarity
between the ox hormone and a hormone found in the urine
of pregnant people— a compound we know today as the
chorionic gonadotropin hormone, or hCG. In pregnancy tests of the day, animals like mice and rabbits were
injected with human urine as a way of testing
for the presence of hCG. However, this required multiple
days of injections, as well as killing and dissecting
the animals to see whether the hormone was present. Because of these hurdles, the test was
reserved for specific use cases, leaving most people waiting for visible
signs to determine if they were pregnant. But these frogs changed everything. They responded to hCG in roughly 9 hours
with no need for dissection. And since their large ovaries
constantly generate eggs, they could participate in numerous tests
over their 15 to 30 year lifespan. Better still, these frogs were abundant
in their native habitat, making them easy to find,
catch, and export. Before long, tens of thousands
of African clawed frogs were being shipped to hospitals
all over the world, making reliable pregnancy tests
widely available for the first time. In the 1970s, the frogs would be
superseded by chemical tests that detected hCG directly. But by then their widespread presence
in laboratories had made African clawed frogs
the star of numerous studies. Their rapid development and ability
to produce eggs in any season made them invaluable models
for developmental biology. African clawed frogs have even been
part of biological studies aboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour. However,
frogs can be slippery subjects. More than a few of these amphibians have
escaped their laboratory enclosures, and in many places, their ferocious appetite allowed them
to outcompete native amphibians. To make matters worse, they often carry a deadly
fungus called chytrid, which can cause an infection
that lethally disrupts the delicate functioning
of amphibian skin. In the 20th century, this fungal infection
has devastated amphibian populations around the globe, causing the extinction
of multiple frog species. Because of all these concerns, the African clawed frog is now classified
as an invasive species, and illegal in many regions. So in the end, like other pregnancy tests, the use of these frogs
in scientific research has had both
positive and negative results.

**Transcript**:
On December 19th, 1915,
an exhibition of radical artworks opened in what’s known today
as St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of these pieces pushed
the boundaries of form and style, but one was particularly controversial. Hanging in the room’s corner—
symbolically occupying a space traditionally reserved
for religious icons— was Kazimir Malevich’s “Black Square.” One attendee scoffed
at the painting’s simplicity, claiming that even a child
could have done it. Another went further, writing that
the “Black Square” would “lead us all to our doom.” Such critiques have plagued paintings
like Malevich’s ever since, their outward simplicity inspiring
outrage and confusion. But a closer look reveals that
not only is Malevich’s work more complicated than it first appears— it may not even be a painting
of a black square at all. Despite its name, you’ll find
the painting’s central form is neither perfectly black
nor perfectly square. Its sides aren't parallel
or equal in length, and the shape isn't quite
centered on the canvas. Instead, Malevich placed the form
slightly off-kilter, giving it the appearance of movement and the white surrounding it
a living, vibrating quality. Technical analysis has revealed that
Malevich already used the canvas for two other paintings. Today, cracks in the aging paint—
known as craquelure— reveal fragments of dusty yellows,
vibrant reds, and faded emeralds, hinting at all the stages Malevich
went through before arriving at the
painting’s final form. His creative process is also evident
in the vigorous brushstrokes, which are displayed proudly
and move in a multitude of directions. Fragments of hair
and Malevich’s fingerprints are also ingrained in the paint, adding both metaphorical
and literal texture to the work. In many ways, Malevich’s whole history
is embedded in the “Black Square.” Born to Polish-speaking
parents in Ukraine, he lived there until he finally saved
enough money to afford the trip to Moscow. Upon arrival in 1904, he plunged 
into all the avant-garde styles swirling around the city. He painted in the style of Impressionism
and absorbed Post-Impressionism. He passed through a Futurist phase and
then became influenced by the Cubists. And by 1913, he was on the verge
of a breakthrough. Malevich realized that even
the most cutting-edge artists were still just painting objects
from everyday life. But he was irresistibly drawn
to what he called the “desert, where nothing is real
except feeling.” And so, feeling became the substance
of his work. The result was the “Black Square”
and a new style he named “Suprematism,” where feeling alone was made supreme. This would be achieved through what
he called non-objectivity— a departure from the world of objects
so extreme it went beyond abstraction. Malevich believed the simplification and
distortion that characterized abstract art was ultimately meaningless, since these styles were still focused 
on depicting real world objects. To him, only the completely
non-representational would truly be new. While this radical approach
alarmed critics, Malevich was undeterred. He spent the next decade explaining
his Suprematist works in essays, and teaching his ideas
to a new generation of artists. But after Stalin's rise
to power in the 1920s, avant-garde approaches like Suprematism
were deemed unproductive to the Communist state. And eventually, it became dangerous to
produce any art outside Socialist Realism— an enforced artistic style celebrating
Soviet leaders and heroic workers. In 1930, Malevich was arrested
by Soviet authorities for spreading subversive ideas. Under severe pressure,
he returned to figuration, painting peasants standing robotically
in barren spaces. But even these later paintings retained
glimmers of his earlier ideas. Gradually, the figures lost
their arms and faces— disintegrating as mechanization
gripped the countryside. During this time,
Malevich also painted a self-portrait that seemed to have abandoned
Suprematism completely. But his open hand formed a quadrilateral, and in the painting's corner
was a tiny black square. This was the symbol of a man who suffered
through wars and revolutions, but never stopped pushing
to create a new art— a refuge of pure feeling that lay
beyond the burden of objects and the suffering of a divided world.

is embedded in the “Black Square.” Born to Polish-speaking
parents in Ukraine, he lived there until he finally saved
enough money to afford the trip to Moscow. Upon arrival in 1904, he plunged 
into all the avant-garde styles swirling around the city. He painted in the style of Impressionism
and absorbed Post-Impressionism. He passed through a Futurist phase and
then became influenced by the Cubists. And by 1913, he was on the verge
of a breakthrough. Malevich realized that even
the most cutting-edge artists were still just painting objects
from everyday life. But he was irresistibly drawn
to what he called the “desert, where nothing is real
except feeling.” And so, feeling became the substance
of his work. The result was the “Black Square”
and a new style he named “Suprematism,” where feeling alone was made supreme. This would be achieved through what
he called non-objectivity— a departure from the world of objects
so extreme it went beyond abstraction. Malevich believed the simplification and
distortion that characterized abstract art was ultimately meaningless, since these styles were still focused 
on depicting real world objects. To him, only the completely
non-representational would truly be new. While this radical approach
alarmed critics, Malevich was undeterred. He spent the next decade explaining
his Suprematist works in essays, and teaching his ideas
to a new generation of artists. But after Stalin's rise
to power in the 1920s, avant-garde approaches like Suprematism
were deemed unproductive to the Communist state. And eventually, it became dangerous to
produce any art outside Socialist Realism— an enforced artistic style celebrating
Soviet leaders and heroic workers. In 1930, Malevich was arrested
by Soviet authorities for spreading subversive ideas. Under severe pressure,
he returned to figuration, painting peasants standing robotically
in barren spaces. But even these later paintings retained
glimmers of his earlier ideas. Gradually, the figures lost
their arms and faces— disintegrating as mechanization
gripped the countryside. During this time,
Malevich also painted a self-portrait that seemed to have abandoned
Suprematism completely. But his open hand formed a quadrilateral, and in the painting's corner
was a tiny black square. This was the symbol of a man who suffered
through wars and revolutions, but never stopped pushing
to create a new art— a refuge of pure feeling that lay
beyond the burden of objects and the suffering of a divided world.

**Transcript**:
On December 19th, 1915,
an exhibition of radical artworks opened in what’s known today
as St. Petersburg, Russia. Many of these pieces pushed
the boundaries of form and style, but one was particularly controversial. Hanging in the room’s corner—
symbolically occupying a space traditionally reserved
for religious icons— was Kazimir Malevich’s “Black Square.” One attendee scoffed
at the painting’s simplicity, claiming that even a child
could have done it. Another went further, writing that
the “Black Square” would “lead us all to our doom.” Such critiques have plagued paintings
like Malevich’s ever since, their outward simplicity inspiring
outrage and confusion. But a closer look reveals that
not only is Malevich’s work more complicated than it first appears— it may not even be a painting
of a black square at all. Despite its name, you’ll find
the painting’s central form is neither perfectly black
nor perfectly square. Its sides aren't parallel
or equal in length, and the shape isn't quite
centered on the canvas. Instead, Malevich placed the form
slightly off-kilter, giving it the appearance of movement and the white surrounding it
a living, vibrating quality. Technical analysis has revealed that
Malevich already used the canvas for two other paintings. Today, cracks in the aging paint—
known as craquelure— reveal fragments of dusty yellows,
vibrant reds, and faded emeralds, hinting at all the stages Malevich
went through before arriving at the
painting’s final form. His creative process is also evident
in the vigorous brushstrokes, which are displayed proudly
and move in a multitude of directions. Fragments of hair
and Malevich’s fingerprints are also ingrained in the paint, adding both metaphorical
and literal texture to the work. In many ways, Malevich’s whole history

**Transcript**:
Here we see an early bird and
a night owl in their natural habitats. The early bird rises with the sun,
springing out of bed abuzz with energy. As the day goes on, they slowly get
more and more exhausted until finally crashing around sunset. Meanwhile, the night owl rises
long after the sun, stumbling groggily from their bed. After about 30 minutes—
or a cup of coffee— they begin to come to life. But they don’t really hit their stride
until later in the day, at which point they comfortably
coast past sunset, only heading to bed in the early hours
of the morning. For many, this is a familiar story,
and one that’s easy to cast yourself in. But how many people are truly
night owls or early birds? And are our natural sleep schedules
predetermined at birth, or can we change them? The truth is there’s a lot of space
between these extremes, and most people fall somewhere
in the middle. These behaviors are determined
by our circadian system— which is anchored by a pair
of nerve cell clusters located in the anterior hypothalamus. These nerve cells respond to light
exposure coming in through your eyes to track the day-night cycle that dictates
your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm. That steady rhythm helps determine
the body’s flow of hormones, with the broader circadian system
acting like a conductor that keeps your organs functioning
in time with one another. And a major part of that performance
is managing the body’s transitions between being awake and being asleep. Now, your circadian system can't just
decide its bedtime and knock you out. However, by tracking how much
light you typically get and when in your waking hours
you usually get it, the system can make predictions about
when you’re likely to need sleep and prepare your body accordingly. For example, if you consistently
go to sleep around 10 pm, your circadian system will start producing
sleep-inducing melatonin around two hours before then
to tell your body it’s time for bed. So if this rhythm is molded
by our sleep habits, can we change it just by sticking
to a strict schedule? To a degree. Everyone’s bodies are unique, so even two people with the same sleep
schedule might have different experiences based on their circadian system’s 
hormonal quirks. For example, where early birds generally
flood with cortisol just before waking up, night owls often have their cortisol peak
roughly 30 minutes after getting up. Hormonal differences like these determine
how you experience your circadian rhythm. And while these factors
can shift with age, you’re unlikely to grow out of your body’s
preferred sleep schedule. That said, you can cultivate habits
to help or hinder your circadian rhythm. Keeping consistent sleeping hours helps
your body accurately predict when to send out hormones, making it easier to stick
to your schedule. Conversely, research in sleep deprived
college students has found their unpredictable
sleeping habits weaken their entire circadian system. Compromised circadian rhythms
are less effective at coordinating organ functioning
and can incur health risks like metabolic disorders
and vulnerable immune systems. But perhaps just as important
as sleep hygiene is light hygiene. Getting sufficient contrast between
bright daylight and dimmer nighttime light is essential for synchronizing
your circadian rhythm, and nothing establishes this contrast
better than sunlight. Even on overcast days, sunlight is much
brighter than standard indoor lighting. So if you're typically
awake during the day, try getting outside as soon as possible
to teach your body when to be active and alert. It’s difficult to maintain
a sleep schedule that pushes against your
body’s preferences. And even if you succeed for months, it only takes one bad night to send
your circadian system back to baseline. But whether you’re an early bird,
night owl, or somewhere in between, it’s important to remember
that as long as you’re consistent, there’s no wrong time
to wake up or go to sleep. What matters most is getting enough rest
for the day ahead.

**Transcript**:
Here we see an early bird and
a night owl in their natural habitats. The early bird rises with the sun,
springing out of bed abuzz with energy. As the day goes on, they slowly get
more and more exhausted until finally crashing around sunset. Meanwhile, the night owl rises
long after the sun, stumbling groggily from their bed. After about 30 minutes—
or a cup of coffee— they begin to come to life. But they don’t really hit their stride
until later in the day, at which point they comfortably
coast past sunset, only heading to bed in the early hours
of the morning. For many, this is a familiar story,
and one that’s easy to cast yourself in. But how many people are truly
night owls or early birds? And are our natural sleep schedules
predetermined at birth, or can we change them? The truth is there’s a lot of space
between these extremes, and most people fall somewhere
in the middle. These behaviors are determined
by our circadian system— which is anchored by a pair
of nerve cell clusters located in the anterior hypothalamus. These nerve cells respond to light
exposure coming in through your eyes to track the day-night cycle that dictates
your body’s internal clock, or circadian rhythm. That steady rhythm helps determine
the body’s flow of hormones, with the broader circadian system
acting like a conductor that keeps your organs functioning
in time with one another. And a major part of that performance
is managing the body’s transitions between being awake and being asleep. Now, your circadian system can't just
decide its bedtime and knock you out. However, by tracking how much
light you typically get and when in your waking hours
you usually get it, the system can make predictions about
when you’re likely to need sleep and prepare your body accordingly. For example, if you consistently
go to sleep around 10 pm, your circadian system will start producing
sleep-inducing melatonin around two hours before then
to tell your body it’s time for bed. So if this rhythm is molded
by our sleep habits, can we change it just by sticking
to a strict schedule? To a degree. Everyone’s bodies are unique, so even two people with the same sleep
schedule might have different experiences based on their circadian system’s 
hormonal quirks. For example, where early birds generally
flood with cortisol just before waking up, night owls often have their cortisol peak
roughly 30 minutes after getting up. Hormonal differences like these determine
how you experience your circadian rhythm. And while these factors
can shift with age, you’re unlikely to grow out of your body’s
preferred sleep schedule. That said, you can cultivate habits
to help or hinder your circadian rhythm. Keeping consistent sleeping hours helps
your body accurately predict when to send out hormones, making it easier to stick
to your schedule. Conversely, research in sleep deprived
college students has found their unpredictable
sleeping habits weaken their entire circadian system. Compromised circadian rhythms
are less effective at coordinating organ functioning
and can incur health risks like metabolic disorders
and vulnerable immune systems. But perhaps just as important
as sleep hygiene is light hygiene. Getting sufficient contrast between
bright daylight and dimmer nighttime light is essential for synchronizing
your circadian rhythm, and nothing establishes this contrast
better than sunlight. Even on overcast days, sunlight is much
brighter than standard indoor lighting. So if you're typically
awake during the day, try getting outside as soon as possible
to teach your body when to be active and alert. It’s difficult to maintain
a sleep schedule that pushes against your
body’s preferences. And even if you succeed for months, it only takes one bad night to send
your circadian system back to baseline. But whether you’re an early bird,
night owl, or somewhere in between, it’s important to remember
that as long as you’re consistent, there’s no wrong time
to wake up or go to sleep. What matters most is getting enough rest
for the day ahead.

**Transcript**:
I know a lot of us are, like, ignoring COVID now. Sure it’s still a thing out there you can catch, but most people seem tired of hearing about it. But not only is COVID not going anywhere – for some people, infection is followed by a protracted, debilitating condition known 
informally as long COVID. The good news is that scientists 
are hard at work on solving that. And while we don’t know 
what causes long COVID yet, we’re getting closer to 
understanding what’s involved, which points at ways to treat it. Today, let’s talk about one area 
where we’ve made some progress. And it has to do with sticky notes on your DNA. [Intro Music] Symptoms of long COVID vary 
dramatically between individuals, but depending on who you ask, it’s defined as experiencing 
signs of illness somewhere between 4 weeks and 3 months following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These effects can be devastating, and have dramatic effects on 
a patient's quality of life, including their ability to work. Now, there is a flurry of interest in this topic – which is great! and you can find scientists looking at everything from the heart to the brain to the lungs to the everywhere. But a few research groups are thinking smaller. Way smaller, down to the fine print and the genes that dictate 
our response to infection. While most every cell in your body has the same sequence of DNA in its nucleus, there are a lot of ways for the cell to decide what genes to use when. They don’t all get used the same 
amount, or at the same rate. Think of it like a textbook that 
you don’t read cover to cover. You’re probably going to reference 
some important sections more often, and skip over others that 
are less relevant to you. You might even use sticky notes to mark a page you want to come back to often. Well, cells have their own version of 
sticky notes in their genetic libraries. Genes may get marked up with tags that tell the cell’s machinery to 
use that gene more or less often. This is the basis for the science of epigenetics a way for the cell to modulate genetic information without changing the sequence of DNA. The kind of epigenetic sticky note we’re going to be talking about 
is called DNA methylation. The best-understood version of methylation usually adds a tag to quiet the gene down, causing it to be read out less 
often than it would otherwise. And we have good reason to think the virus that causes COVID-19 may affect epigenetic signals in our cells. Back in 2017, before anyone had ever heard the word “COVID”, researchers were looking into the epigenetic 
effects of SARS and MERS infections, which are both coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. It's unlikely that the virus is moving genetic sticky notes itself  Rather, the thinking seems to be that our own bodies produce more or less of the products of certain genes to make infection less severe. In long COVID, research is starting to suggest that the changes to these signals persist when the body should have scaled 
them back after infection. And here’s the thing – we can read these epigenetic signals. So if we can identify genes whose signals are consistently changed in 
patients with long COVID, we might be able to both 
diagnose long COVID more easily, and shake those genes down for answers about how to treat those patients. A research group based in Sweden has studied DNA methylation in the blood cells of patients with long COVID. In the study, published in the 
journal Clinical Epigenetics in 2022. they found several genes and groups of genes with changes in their methylation after infection. These included some seriously tantalizing hits: genes involved in regulating ACE2, the now-famous protein that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to invade cells. Some genes were also involved 
in histamine signaling, which lines up with the evidence that some antihistamine medications can benefit long COVID patients. Most intriguing, some of these methylated genes were related to taste and smell, which makes sense given that one of COVID’s signature symptoms is loss of those senses. Before we get too excited, though, this was a small study with 
only 10 long COVID patients. So while it isn’t as robust as we would like, that’s unfortunately the case for 
a lot of COVID-related research because it’s just so new. Another research group, this one based in the US, looked at patients recovering from COVID in a pair of papers between 2021 and 2022. They had a total of 102 participants with COVID in their first study, and followed up one year later with 15 of them who reported symptoms of long COVID. They also found changes in DNA methylation that persisted after infection… but in pretty much totally different 
genes than the Swedish study identified. Their previous study had found about 1500 genes whose methylation status changed during acute COVID-19 infection. Of those, 71 remained altered a year later. Broadly speaking, those genes tended to be related to inflammation and response to infection. Basically, a totally different group of genes than what the Swedish team found, although at least some of those 
genes had similar functions. Unfortunately, not all of the studies on 
methylation and long COVID have supported a connection between them. A third study found no difference in methylation between people with long 
COVID and people in remission. These studies were all on the smaller side, with tons of differences between the patients who participated in them. But just for fun, let’s revisit a few of the methylated genes that those studies did find. Because they do all seem relevant to long COVID if larger studies can validate their involvement. For example, the US-based group says that the pattern of 
gene expression they found could help to explain the increase in cardiovascular events that follows COVID-19. And the Swedish group identified 
genes related to ACE2, which interestingly lines 
up with an idea out there that patients develop antibodies to their own ACE2 after infection, which might contribute to 
inflammation occurring in long COVID. Even more interestingly, this group also noticed that their patients had some 
similar self-antibodies floating around to patients with MECFS – what you might know as chronic fatigue syndrome. And they noticed epigenetic changes to 
those self-antibody receptors as well. I don’t want to get too excited 
about such a small study, but the evidence for a link between long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome is piling up everywhere you look. And what’s better than understanding one disease? Understanding two. So while it’s early days for this research, there’s a lot going on in the world 
of COVID-19 epigenetic studies, and studies of COVID-19 in general. But as we discover more about 
how this spiky little virus is messing with our sticky notes, we can hopefully find ways to get 
our DNA textbooks back in order. Which is something that’s worth learning, even if you’re tired of hearing about COVID. This video was made possible thanks to our supporters on Patreon. Our patrons allow us to

**Transcript**:
I know a lot of us are, like, ignoring COVID now. Sure it’s still a thing out there you can catch, but most people seem tired of hearing about it. But not only is COVID not going anywhere – for some people, infection is followed by a protracted, debilitating condition known 
informally as long COVID. The good news is that scientists 
are hard at work on solving that. And while we don’t know 
what causes long COVID yet, we’re getting closer to 
understanding what’s involved, which points at ways to treat it. Today, let’s talk about one area 
where we’ve made some progress. And it has to do with sticky notes on your DNA. [Intro Music] Symptoms of long COVID vary 
dramatically between individuals, but depending on who you ask, it’s defined as experiencing 
signs of illness somewhere between 4 weeks and 3 months following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These effects can be devastating, and have dramatic effects on 
a patient's quality of life, including their ability to work. Now, there is a flurry of interest in this topic – which is great! and you can find scientists looking at everything from the heart to the brain to the lungs to the everywhere. But a few research groups are thinking smaller. Way smaller, down to the fine print and the genes that dictate 
our response to infection. While most every cell in your body has the same sequence of DNA in its nucleus, there are a lot of ways for the cell to decide what genes to use when. They don’t all get used the same 
amount, or at the same rate. Think of it like a textbook that 
you don’t read cover to cover. You’re probably going to reference 
some important sections more often, and skip over others that 
are less relevant to you. You might even use sticky notes to mark a page you want to come back to often. Well, cells have their own version of 
sticky notes in their genetic libraries. Genes may get marked up with tags that tell the cell’s machinery to 
use that gene more or less often. This is the basis for the science of epigenetics a way for the cell to modulate genetic information without changing the sequence of DNA. The kind of epigenetic sticky note we’re going to be talking about 
is called DNA methylation. The best-understood version of methylation usually adds a tag to quiet the gene down, causing it to be read out less 
often than it would otherwise. And we have good reason to think the virus that causes COVID-19 may affect epigenetic signals in our cells. Back in 2017, before anyone had ever heard the word “COVID”, researchers were looking into the epigenetic 
effects of SARS and MERS infections, which are both coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2. It's unlikely that the virus is moving genetic sticky notes itself  Rather, the thinking seems to be that our own bodies produce more or less of the products of certain genes to make infection less severe. In long COVID, research is starting to suggest that the changes to these signals persist when the body should have scaled 
them back after infection. And here’s the thing – we can read these epigenetic signals. So if we can identify genes whose signals are consistently changed in 
patients with long COVID, we might be able to both 
diagnose long COVID more easily, and shake those genes down for answers about how to treat those patients. A research group based in Sweden has studied DNA methylation in the blood cells of patients with long COVID. In the study, published in the 
journal Clinical Epigenetics in 2022. they found several genes and groups of genes with changes in their methylation after infection. These included some seriously tantalizing hits: genes involved in regulating ACE2, the now-famous protein that the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses to invade cells. Some genes were also involved 
in histamine signaling, which lines up with the evidence that some antihistamine medications can benefit long COVID patients. Most intriguing, some of these methylated genes were related to taste and smell, which makes sense given that one of COVID’s signature symptoms is loss of those senses. Before we get too excited, though, this was a small study with 
only 10 long COVID patients. So while it isn’t as robust as we would like, that’s unfortunately the case for 
a lot of COVID-related research because it’s just so new. Another research group, this one based in the US, looked at patients recovering from COVID in a pair of papers between 2021 and 2022. They had a total of 102 participants with COVID in their first study, and followed up one year later with 15 of them who reported symptoms of long COVID. They also found changes in DNA methylation that persisted after infection… but in pretty much totally different 
genes than the Swedish study identified. Their previous study had found about 1500 genes whose methylation status changed during acute COVID-19 infection. Of those, 71 remained altered a year later. Broadly speaking, those genes tended to be related to inflammation and response to infection. Basically, a totally different group of genes than what the Swedish team found, although at least some of those 
genes had similar functions. Unfortunately, not all of the studies on 
methylation and long COVID have supported a connection between them. A third study found no difference in methylation between people with long 
COVID and people in remission. These studies were all on the smaller side, with tons of differences between the patients who participated in them. But just for fun, let’s revisit a few of the methylated genes that those studies did find. Because they do all seem relevant to long COVID if larger studies can validate their involvement. For example, the US-based group says that the pattern of 
gene expression they found could help to explain the increase in cardiovascular events that follows COVID-19. And the Swedish group identified 
genes related to ACE2, which interestingly lines 
up with an idea out there that patients develop antibodies to their own ACE2 after infection, which might contribute to 
inflammation occurring in long COVID. Even more interestingly, this group also noticed that their patients had some 
similar self-antibodies floating around to patients with MECFS – what you might know as chronic fatigue syndrome. And they noticed epigenetic changes to 
those self-antibody receptors as well. I don’t want to get too excited 
about such a small study, but the evidence for a link between long COVID and chronic fatigue syndrome is piling up everywhere you look. And what’s better than understanding one disease? Understanding two. So while it’s early days for this research, there’s a lot going on in the world 
of COVID-19 epigenetic studies, and studies of COVID-19 in general. But as we discover more about 
how this spiky little virus is messing with our sticky notes, we can hopefully find ways to get 
our DNA textbooks back in order. Which is something that’s worth learning, even if you’re tired of hearing about COVID. This video was made possible thanks to our supporters on Patreon. Our patrons allow us to

**Transcript**:
Over the past two decades, jellyfish
have begun to overwhelm our oceans. In New Zealand, divers swat off millions
of stinging jellyfish each no larger than a grain of pepper. In Sweden, a massive cluster
of moon jellyfish shut down one of the world’s largest
nuclear reactors by clogging the plant’s essential pipes. And in the Sea of Japan, thousands
of 200 kilogram Nomura’s jellyfish with bells two meters in diameter
swarm fishermen, snapping nets and devouring local fish. Around the world, these animals
voraciously consume fish eggs and larvae, routinely undermine
marine farming efforts, and outcompete adult fish by consuming
the resources they need to survive. If things stay on their
current trajectory, we could be headed for a future where
the entire ocean is thick with jellyfish. So, is there anything that can keep these
gelatinous creatures under control? Enter, the humble sea turtle. There are a wide range of marine animals
that feed on jellyfish, but sea turtles are among
their most ancient predators. And while every known species
of sea turtle preys on jellyfish at some point in their lives, none consume quite as many
as the leatherback. Leatherbacks are the largest species
of sea turtle, and they eat jellyfish almost exclusively, devouring well over 1,000 metric tons of
them over their roughly 50-year lifespans. This is particularly remarkable
because jellyfish are 95% water and very low in calories, so to maintain a healthy weight, the average 500 kilogram leatherback needs to eat roughly 400 kilograms
of jellyfish every day. That’s roughly the same weight
as a grand piano. And while some sea turtle species
have been documented selectively eating their preys’
protein-rich gonads, leatherbacks eat jellyfish whole— mowing down huge swaths
of unsuspecting jellies. Normally, jellyfish aren't
quite this defenseless. Most species have tentacles covered
in cells called cnidocytes, which contain venomous harpoons
coiled and ready to launch. These barbed structures, 
known as nematocysts, are released on contact. Jellyfish frequently use this sting
to paralyze and kill their food, and it can also irritate the skin
of would-be intruders. But it's completely useless
against sea turtles. Most of these reptiles have thick
scales covered in keratin— the same material that makes
up nails and claws. This leathery armor protects
their skin while they hunt, and any captured prey that tries
to escape is impaled on the keratinized spikes
lining the leatherback’s esophagus. For most sea turtles, these adaptations
make individual jellyfish easy prey. However, a jelly population’s
true defense mechanism is in how quickly they can reproduce. Almost all jellyfish species have evolved
to reproduce both sexually and asexually, allowing them to increase their numbers
with or without a partner. In tropical environments, jellyfish reproduce constantly
throughout the year. But in more temperate climates, species often reproduce all at once
in a massive bloom, where jellies multiply at alarming rates. And humanity is making these blooms
much more frequent. Fertilizer runoff from farms
introduces chemicals that simultaneously kill other fish
and prompt blooms. High water temperatures
caused by climate change speed up jellyfish reproduction
and extend the reproductive season. Meanwhile, both marine
construction and pollution dramatically increase the surface area
for jellyfish polyps to attach, grow, and mature. All these issues require a wide range
of policy-based solutions. But one major way to prevent jellyfish
populations from getting out of hand is to protect their natural predators— many of whom are currently under threat. Small-scale fisheries that are essential
to communities in Mexico and Peru often use gillnets, which unintentionally capture and kill
hundreds of sea turtles each year. In the Eastern Pacific, these practices
could drive leatherbacks to extinction in the next 60 years. Fortunately, some researchers have already
developed inexpensive tools to minimize these risks. Attaching green LED lights to gillnets
has proven useful for allowing sea turtles, dolphins,
and even seabirds to avoid fishing gear. Solutions like this should 
allow small-scale fishers to support their communities while minimizing their impact
on our leathery ocean defenders.

because jellyfish are 95% water and very low in calories, so to maintain a healthy weight, the average 500 kilogram leatherback needs to eat roughly 400 kilograms
of jellyfish every day. That’s roughly the same weight
as a grand piano. And while some sea turtle species
have been documented selectively eating their preys’
protein-rich gonads, leatherbacks eat jellyfish whole— mowing down huge swaths
of unsuspecting jellies. Normally, jellyfish aren't
quite this defenseless. Most species have tentacles covered
in cells called cnidocytes, which contain venomous harpoons
coiled and ready to launch. These barbed structures, 
known as nematocysts, are released on contact. Jellyfish frequently use this sting
to paralyze and kill their food, and it can also irritate the skin
of would-be intruders. But it's completely useless
against sea turtles. Most of these reptiles have thick
scales covered in keratin— the same material that makes
up nails and claws. This leathery armor protects
their skin while they hunt, and any captured prey that tries
to escape is impaled on the keratinized spikes
lining the leatherback’s esophagus. For most sea turtles, these adaptations
make individual jellyfish easy prey. However, a jelly population’s
true defense mechanism is in how quickly they can reproduce. Almost all jellyfish species have evolved
to reproduce both sexually and asexually, allowing them to increase their numbers
with or without a partner. In tropical environments, jellyfish reproduce constantly
throughout the year. But in more temperate climates, species often reproduce all at once
in a massive bloom, where jellies multiply at alarming rates. And humanity is making these blooms
much more frequent. Fertilizer runoff from farms
introduces chemicals that simultaneously kill other fish
and prompt blooms. High water temperatures
caused by climate change speed up jellyfish reproduction
and extend the reproductive season. Meanwhile, both marine
construction and pollution dramatically increase the surface area
for jellyfish polyps to attach, grow, and mature. All these issues require a wide range
of policy-based solutions. But one major way to prevent jellyfish
populations from getting out of hand is to protect their natural predators— many of whom are currently under threat. Small-scale fisheries that are essential
to communities in Mexico and Peru often use gillnets, which unintentionally capture and kill
hundreds of sea turtles each year. In the Eastern Pacific, these practices
could drive leatherbacks to extinction in the next 60 years. Fortunately, some researchers have already
developed inexpensive tools to minimize these risks. Attaching green LED lights to gillnets
has proven useful for allowing sea turtles, dolphins,
and even seabirds to avoid fishing gear. Solutions like this should 
allow small-scale fishers to support their communities while minimizing their impact
on our leathery ocean defenders.

**Transcript**:
Over the past two decades, jellyfish
have begun to overwhelm our oceans. In New Zealand, divers swat off millions
of stinging jellyfish each no larger than a grain of pepper. In Sweden, a massive cluster
of moon jellyfish shut down one of the world’s largest
nuclear reactors by clogging the plant’s essential pipes. And in the Sea of Japan, thousands
of 200 kilogram Nomura’s jellyfish with bells two meters in diameter
swarm fishermen, snapping nets and devouring local fish. Around the world, these animals
voraciously consume fish eggs and larvae, routinely undermine
marine farming efforts, and outcompete adult fish by consuming
the resources they need to survive. If things stay on their
current trajectory, we could be headed for a future where
the entire ocean is thick with jellyfish. So, is there anything that can keep these
gelatinous creatures under control? Enter, the humble sea turtle. There are a wide range of marine animals
that feed on jellyfish, but sea turtles are among
their most ancient predators. And while every known species
of sea turtle preys on jellyfish at some point in their lives, none consume quite as many

**Transcript**:
It's 5000 BCE in the verdant
swamps of North America, and this young deer has
no idea it’s being hunted. Suddenly, an alligator hurtles out of the
water at almost 50 kilometers an hour, locking its jaws around its prey and swinging wildly in a signature move
known as the death roll. This deer never stood a chance, but then, nothing in this region can
compete with this apex predator. These alligators easily devour
the birds, turtles, and small fish living in what’s known today
as Everglades National Park. But despite ruling the swamp
for millennia, the last 500 years have brought
deadly new predators that challenge the alligators’ reign. And the origins of these international
invaders are just as unexpected as their impact on the Everglades. We tend to think of swamps
as hostile landscapes since they’re overflowing
with plant and animal life. But all this biodiversity makes these
environments vital to regional food webs. And the Everglades are no exception. The park's subtropical climate can support
species from around the world, and its borders are full of ecotones—
transition areas between habitats— that connect the region’s
freshwater prairies, rocky pinelands, mangrove forests,
and more. Human activity has made the region
even more biodiverse, developing Florida into a major port that welcomes countless human
and non-human migrants. In the 1500s, Spanish colonizers
brought wild boar to the area, which quickly multiplied
and uprooted the wetlands. They devoured alligator eggs and spread
European parasites to local panthers. Then, in the 1800s,
Florida’s shipping industry exploded, bringing all manner
of new invasive species. Brazilian peppertrees blocked out the sun,
water hyacinths clogged the rivers, and brown anole lizards
upset the food chain. Alligator populations mostly
endured this onslaught, but in the late 19th century, human intervention kicked
things up a notch. Government and business officials wanted
to turn the Everglades into farmland and began building canals
to drain the swamp. They also planted non-native trees
which crowded out the plants local birds relied on for
food and shelter, which in turn limited
the alligators’ supply of prey. Interventions like this wreaked havoc
on the Everglades for decades, until a conservationist named 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas finally came to their defense. In 1947, Douglas published a landmark book
explaining that the Everglades were not only a unique
and precious ecosystem, but that the region’s most fearsome
residents were actually vital to sustaining it. During the wet season, alligators are constantly shaping
the muddy landscape, drawing lines with their bodies and digging holes
with their snouts, claws, and tails. In the dry season, these indentations become essential
watering holes and firebreaks, maintaining and protecting
the swamp’s other residents. In the wake of Douglas’ book,
Everglades National Park was established to formally begin protecting
the landscape and its scaly stewards. But outside the park, conditions were brewing
for the most dangerous invasion yet. Over the next 40 years,
the exotic pet trade brought parakeets, iguanas,
and relatives of piranhas to the region. In the 1990s, Burmese pythons became
a cheap, popular pet for many Floridians. Some snake owners released their pets
into the wild when they grew too large. But the python population
really exploded in 1992 when a hurricane destroyed
a breeding facility and released countless snakes
into the wild. Since then, pythons have been
connected to a 90% decrease in some local mammal populations, decimating the alligators’ food supply. And with help from other invasive
reptiles like black and white tegus— giant lizards who devour alligator eggs— these snakes have made a serious play
for the top of the local food chain. Today, Florida ranks among the regions
with the most invasive species in the world. Some researchers suggest
hunting these invaders down, while others recommend bringing in yet
more creatures to balance the scales, such as releasing insects
to eat invasive plants. It might seem absurd to try solving
this problem with more foreign fauna. But perhaps a new arrival could
fight invaders and feed the alligators— giving them the boost they need
to reclaim their ancient home.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
It's 5000 BCE in the verdant
swamps of North America, and this young deer has
no idea it’s being hunted. Suddenly, an alligator hurtles out of the
water at almost 50 kilometers an hour, locking its jaws around its prey and swinging wildly in a signature move
known as the death roll. This deer never stood a chance, but then, nothing in this region can
compete with this apex predator. These alligators easily devour
the birds, turtles, and small fish living in what’s known today
as Everglades National Park. But despite ruling the swamp
for millennia, the last 500 years have brought
deadly new predators that challenge the alligators’ reign. And the origins of these international
invaders are just as unexpected as their impact on the Everglades. We tend to think of swamps
as hostile landscapes since they’re overflowing
with plant and animal life. But all this biodiversity makes these
environments vital to regional food webs. And the Everglades are no exception. The park's subtropical climate can support
species from around the world, and its borders are full of ecotones—
transition areas between habitats— that connect the region’s
freshwater prairies, rocky pinelands, mangrove forests,
and more. Human activity has made the region
even more biodiverse, developing Florida into a major port that welcomes countless human
and non-human migrants. In the 1500s, Spanish colonizers
brought wild boar to the area, which quickly multiplied
and uprooted the wetlands. They devoured alligator eggs and spread
European parasites to local panthers. Then, in the 1800s,
Florida’s shipping industry exploded, bringing all manner
of new invasive species. Brazilian peppertrees blocked out the sun,
water hyacinths clogged the rivers, and brown anole lizards
upset the food chain. Alligator populations mostly
endured this onslaught, but in the late 19th century, human intervention kicked
things up a notch. Government and business officials wanted
to turn the Everglades into farmland and began building canals
to drain the swamp. They also planted non-native trees
which crowded out the plants local birds relied on for
food and shelter, which in turn limited
the alligators’ supply of prey. Interventions like this wreaked havoc
on the Everglades for decades, until a conservationist named 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas finally came to their defense. In 1947, Douglas published a landmark book
explaining that the Everglades were not only a unique
and precious ecosystem, but that the region’s most fearsome
residents were actually vital to sustaining it. During the wet season, alligators are constantly shaping
the muddy landscape, drawing lines with their bodies and digging holes
with their snouts, claws, and tails. In the dry season, these indentations become essential
watering holes and firebreaks, maintaining and protecting
the swamp’s other residents. In the wake of Douglas’ book,
Everglades National Park was established to formally begin protecting
the landscape and its scaly stewards. But outside the park, conditions were brewing
for the most dangerous invasion yet. Over the next 40 years,
the exotic pet trade brought parakeets, iguanas,
and relatives of piranhas to the region. In the 1990s, Burmese pythons became
a cheap, popular pet for many Floridians. Some snake owners released their pets
into the wild when they grew too large. But the python population
really exploded in 1992 when a hurricane destroyed
a breeding facility and released countless snakes
into the wild. Since then, pythons have been
connected to a 90% decrease in some local mammal populations, decimating the alligators’ food supply. And with help from other invasive
reptiles like black and white tegus— giant lizards who devour alligator eggs— these snakes have made a serious play
for the top of the local food chain. Today, Florida ranks among the regions
with the most invasive species in the world. Some researchers suggest
hunting these invaders down, while others recommend bringing in yet
more creatures to balance the scales, such as releasing insects
to eat invasive plants. It might seem absurd to try solving
this problem with more foreign fauna. But perhaps a new arrival could
fight invaders and feed the alligators— giving them the boost they need
to reclaim their ancient home.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 2021, a survey of over 1,000 Americans
found that nearly two-thirds had eaten plant-based meat alternatives
in the past year. Many cited potential health
and environmental benefits as their motivation. But are these alternative meats actually
better for us and the planet? First, let’s introduce the contenders. Meat from butchered animals,
which we’ll call farmed meat, is a complex structure of muscle fibers,
connective tissues, and fat. You may recognize meat
from its role in the human diet, stretching back to our species’
very beginnings. Our next challenger, 
the plant-based meat alternative, may look and taste like meat, but it’s built with proteins,
carbohydrates, fats, and other molecules from plants. Transforming plant molecules
into something that resembles meat takes effort. Meat’s fibrous texture is created
by long rod-like proteins. To replicate this structure, a plant’s ball-shaped proteins can be
pushed through an extruder device which forces them to unwind
and join into long filaments. To mimic animal fat, companies mix
in fats and oils extracted from plants. One popular brand adds
a beet juice pigment that changes the patty’s color
as it cooks. Another adds an iron-containing molecule
called heme, which their team says
is key to its meaty flavor. The resulting products come in many forms. Finally, our last entrant:
lab-grown meat. Also known as cell-based meat
and cultured meat, these products begin as animal stem cells that researchers coax to multiply
and form into muscle. It’s worth noting that lab-grown meats
are largely still in development, so the exact process may change
when they’re produced at greater commercial scale. So which meat or lookalike
is best for your health? Farmed meat is a vital source of protein
and nutrients for many people. But researchers have also found links
between diets high in red and processed meats and health concerns like
type 2 diabetes and heart disease. One 2012 study concluded
that swapping red meat for other options like chicken, nuts,
or legumes for one meal a day can potentially reduce mortality risk
by 7 to 19%. There is not enough data to know
whether replacing red meat with a plant-based patty
would have the same effect. Plant-based meats, while containing
just as much protein, calories, and iron as farmed meat, are highly processed and, therefore,
high in sodium. And many contain coconut oil,
which has a lot of saturated fat, and, like red meat,
may elevate heart disease risk. Lab-grown meat, meanwhile, has the potential to offer the same
nutritional qualities and health risks as farmed meat. But we won’t know for sure until
product development is further along. So which contender is better
for the environment? Animal agriculture generates
an estimated 14.5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that producing
plant-based meat substitutes results in, on average, around 90% less
greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent amount of beef, 63% less than pork,
and 51% less than poultry. Plant-based meat alternatives also tend
to require far less land and water than farmed meat. And their production results in much lower
levels of pollutants running off farms and entering waterways— which threaten both the environment
and public health. As for lab-grown meat, today the industry largely takes
its stem cells from the muscle tissue of livestock. But how many animals will be required
for these biopsies once production scales up? It also isn’t clear to what degree
alternative meats will reduce the environmental impact
of the farmed meats industry. What if, instead of replacing
meat with alternatives, people continue to consume
the same amount of farmed meat while also eating newer options? While the verdict is still out on which
meat is nutritionally superior, if you care about your personal
impact on animal welfare, public health, and the environment, plant-based meat tends to come out on top. And switching to meat alternatives doesn’t
have to be an all-or-nothing decision. In fact, a 2022 study estimated that
forgoing red meat at just one meal a day can decrease your personal dietary
carbon emissions by as much as 48%.

by long rod-like proteins. To replicate this structure, a plant’s ball-shaped proteins can be
pushed through an extruder device which forces them to unwind
and join into long filaments. To mimic animal fat, companies mix
in fats and oils extracted from plants. One popular brand adds
a beet juice pigment that changes the patty’s color
as it cooks. Another adds an iron-containing molecule
called heme, which their team says
is key to its meaty flavor. The resulting products come in many forms. Finally, our last entrant:
lab-grown meat. Also known as cell-based meat
and cultured meat, these products begin as animal stem cells that researchers coax to multiply
and form into muscle. It’s worth noting that lab-grown meats
are largely still in development, so the exact process may change
when they’re produced at greater commercial scale. So which meat or lookalike
is best for your health? Farmed meat is a vital source of protein
and nutrients for many people. But researchers have also found links
between diets high in red and processed meats and health concerns like
type 2 diabetes and heart disease. One 2012 study concluded
that swapping red meat for other options like chicken, nuts,
or legumes for one meal a day can potentially reduce mortality risk
by 7 to 19%. There is not enough data to know
whether replacing red meat with a plant-based patty
would have the same effect. Plant-based meats, while containing
just as much protein, calories, and iron as farmed meat, are highly processed and, therefore,
high in sodium. And many contain coconut oil,
which has a lot of saturated fat, and, like red meat,
may elevate heart disease risk. Lab-grown meat, meanwhile, has the potential to offer the same
nutritional qualities and health risks as farmed meat. But we won’t know for sure until
product development is further along. So which contender is better
for the environment? Animal agriculture generates
an estimated 14.5% of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers estimate that producing
plant-based meat substitutes results in, on average, around 90% less
greenhouse gas emissions than an equivalent amount of beef, 63% less than pork,
and 51% less than poultry. Plant-based meat alternatives also tend
to require far less land and water than farmed meat. And their production results in much lower
levels of pollutants running off farms and entering waterways— which threaten both the environment
and public health. As for lab-grown meat, today the industry largely takes
its stem cells from the muscle tissue of livestock. But how many animals will be required
for these biopsies once production scales up? It also isn’t clear to what degree
alternative meats will reduce the environmental impact
of the farmed meats industry. What if, instead of replacing
meat with alternatives, people continue to consume
the same amount of farmed meat while also eating newer options? While the verdict is still out on which
meat is nutritionally superior, if you care about your personal
impact on animal welfare, public health, and the environment, plant-based meat tends to come out on top. And switching to meat alternatives doesn’t
have to be an all-or-nothing decision. In fact, a 2022 study estimated that
forgoing red meat at just one meal a day can decrease your personal dietary
carbon emissions by as much as 48%.

**Transcript**:
On September 19th, 1991,
two hikers traversing the Ötzal Alps on the border of Austria and Italy
discovered a corpse emerging from the ice. Researchers soon realized they weren’t
looking at the victim of a recent climbing accident,
as initially assumed, but the mummified body of a man
who’d lived about 5,300 years ago, who they came to call Ötzi the Iceman. One early theory for Ötzi’s alpine death
was that he was a local shepherd or hunter who got caught in bad weather and froze. However, a shocking discovery eventually
revealed his true cause of death and upended his story. So, what do we know about Ötzi? And how did he die? Over the millennia, the Alpine cold 
and sun protected Ötzi’s body from decomposition, 
freezing and drying it out in cycles, and leaving critical clues
for researchers. Ötzi was about 160 centimeters tall,
weighed some 50 kilograms, and died between 40- and 50-years-old. He led an active life but had
a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular diseases. His intestines were also parasitized
by whipworms and his stomach contained
ulcer-causing bacteria, all of which might have caused
some unpleasant symptoms. He died hundreds of years before
Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid were constructed, around 3350 BCE. Ötzi lived during the late
Neolithic Copper Age, when metal extraction
and crafting practices were spreading throughout Eurasia. Indeed, along with stone arrowheads
and knives, Ötzi carried an axe made of copper
from what is now Tuscany. Swaths of his clothing were made
of sheep and goat leather, and his diet included cultivated grains, all of which suggested that Ötzi’s people
relied on certain domesticated animals and crops. And when researchers 
inspected Ötzi’s skin with light ranging from infrared to UV, they found a total of 61 tattoos. Interestingly, the markings corresponded
with areas of Ötzi’s body where he probably experienced pain, like from degeneration observed
in his knees, ankles, and spine. Researchers think that the tattoos
might have been intended as treatment— perhaps an early form of acupuncture. Close scrutiny also clarified
the circumstances of Ötzi’s death— and led to a tantalizing prehistoric
murder mystery. A decade into studying Ötzi,
a CT scan picked up a crucial detail: there was a flint arrowhead lodged
in Ötzi’s left shoulder. Soon enough, researchers started piecing
Ötzi’s final days together. A deep cut wound on Ötzi’s hand
showed initial signs of healing and must have occurred
just days before his death. It was likely a defensive wound
which indicated that Ötzi was attacked with a sharp blade
but fought back and survived. Ötzi may have dressed
the wound with bog moss, which has antiseptic properties
and was found with his remains. Meanwhile, the types and location
of pollen in Ötzi’s digestive tract indicated that it was spring
or early summer and that his last three days were hectic. Ötzi seemed to be fleeing something. About 33 hours before his death, Ötzi was at an altitude
of around 2,500 meters, near the timber line. Then, approximately 24 hours later, he descended to at least 1,200 meters,
to a zone of warmth-loving trees. In his final hours, Ötzi reached
an altitude of around 3,000 meters where grasses, sedges,
and certain wildflowers dominated. His last meal included a large helping
of dried wild ibex, roe deer, and grains. Then, despite Ötzi’s apparent efforts
to escape the conflict, someone at a distant vantage
shot him from behind. The arrow pierced a major artery
and embedded itself in his left shoulder, causing extensive blood loss. Ötzi probably died soon after, his remains and all his belongings left
undisturbed in the glacier for millennia. This 5,300-year-old cold case has offered
invaluable glimpses into the distant past. But the mystery of who exactly Ötzi was
and why he was killed will probably never be solved— the tangible evidence for the act
degraded and carried away, lost to snow drifts long ago.

to a zone of warmth-loving trees. In his final hours, Ötzi reached
an altitude of around 3,000 meters where grasses, sedges,
and certain wildflowers dominated. His last meal included a large helping
of dried wild ibex, roe deer, and grains. Then, despite Ötzi’s apparent efforts
to escape the conflict, someone at a distant vantage
shot him from behind. The arrow pierced a major artery
and embedded itself in his left shoulder, causing extensive blood loss. Ötzi probably died soon after, his remains and all his belongings left
undisturbed in the glacier for millennia. This 5,300-year-old cold case has offered
invaluable glimpses into the distant past. But the mystery of who exactly Ötzi was
and why he was killed will probably never be solved— the tangible evidence for the act
degraded and carried away, lost to snow drifts long ago.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
On September 19th, 1991,
two hikers traversing the Ötzal Alps on the border of Austria and Italy
discovered a corpse emerging from the ice. Researchers soon realized they weren’t
looking at the victim of a recent climbing accident,
as initially assumed, but the mummified body of a man
who’d lived about 5,300 years ago, who they came to call Ötzi the Iceman. One early theory for Ötzi’s alpine death
was that he was a local shepherd or hunter who got caught in bad weather and froze. However, a shocking discovery eventually
revealed his true cause of death and upended his story. So, what do we know about Ötzi? And how did he die? Over the millennia, the Alpine cold 
and sun protected Ötzi’s body from decomposition, 
freezing and drying it out in cycles, and leaving critical clues
for researchers. Ötzi was about 160 centimeters tall,
weighed some 50 kilograms, and died between 40- and 50-years-old. He led an active life but had
a strong genetic predisposition for cardiovascular diseases. His intestines were also parasitized
by whipworms and his stomach contained
ulcer-causing bacteria, all of which might have caused
some unpleasant symptoms. He died hundreds of years before
Stonehenge and the Great Pyramid were constructed, around 3350 BCE. Ötzi lived during the late
Neolithic Copper Age, when metal extraction
and crafting practices were spreading throughout Eurasia. Indeed, along with stone arrowheads
and knives, Ötzi carried an axe made of copper
from what is now Tuscany. Swaths of his clothing were made
of sheep and goat leather, and his diet included cultivated grains, all of which suggested that Ötzi’s people
relied on certain domesticated animals and crops. And when researchers 
inspected Ötzi’s skin with light ranging from infrared to UV, they found a total of 61 tattoos. Interestingly, the markings corresponded
with areas of Ötzi’s body where he probably experienced pain, like from degeneration observed
in his knees, ankles, and spine. Researchers think that the tattoos
might have been intended as treatment— perhaps an early form of acupuncture. Close scrutiny also clarified
the circumstances of Ötzi’s death— and led to a tantalizing prehistoric
murder mystery. A decade into studying Ötzi,
a CT scan picked up a crucial detail: there was a flint arrowhead lodged
in Ötzi’s left shoulder. Soon enough, researchers started piecing
Ötzi’s final days together. A deep cut wound on Ötzi’s hand
showed initial signs of healing and must have occurred
just days before his death. It was likely a defensive wound
which indicated that Ötzi was attacked with a sharp blade
but fought back and survived. Ötzi may have dressed
the wound with bog moss, which has antiseptic properties
and was found with his remains. Meanwhile, the types and location
of pollen in Ötzi’s digestive tract indicated that it was spring
or early summer and that his last three days were hectic. Ötzi seemed to be fleeing something. About 33 hours before his death, Ötzi was at an altitude
of around 2,500 meters, near the timber line. Then, approximately 24 hours later, he descended to at least 1,200 meters,
to a zone of warmth-loving trees. In his final hours, Ötzi reached
an altitude of around 3,000 meters where grasses, sedges,
and certain wildflowers dominated. His last meal included a large helping
of dried wild ibex, roe deer, and grains. Then, despite Ötzi’s apparent efforts

and embedded itself in his left shoulder, causing extensive blood loss. Ötzi probably died soon after, his remains and all his belongings left

**Transcript**:
A tennis player wins
her second straight set, feeling like she can predict
her opponent's next move. A musician works to master
a chord progression, unfazed by mistakes as he repeatedly
plays the same four bars. A scientist fails to notice her morning
alarm blare from the next room, having analyzed data through the night. While each of these people is immersed
in a different activity, requiring specific skills
and knowledge sets, all three are experiencing
what is known as flow— a unique mental state
of effortless engagement. And while you may not be a scientist
or professional athlete, anyone can find flow. This is a good thing, as those who more frequently 
experience flow report higher levels of positive emotions, creativity,
and feelings of accomplishment. Further, research has linked it
to increased productivity, enhanced learning,
and academic achievement. But what exactly is flow?
And how can we find it in our daily lives? Flow is more than just concentrating
or paying attention. Psychologists go so far as to define flow
as an altered state of consciousness with several defining features. First, those in flow tend to feel
so effortlessly engaged in a task that time seems to fly by. They are not easily distracted. In contrast with cycles
of procrastination, when it can feel impossible
to start an activity, during flow it can feel difficult to stop. Flow also tends to diminish feelings
of worry or self-judgment, in turn fostering creativity. And people report experiencing a sense
of oneness with what they’re doing, allowing for peak performance. Further, brain imaging studies have shown
that flow is accompanied by changes in neural activity, notably in regions that play a role in attention, self-awareness,
and self-consciousness. Despite decades of research, 
many questions still remain. How do the brains of those in flow compare to those in other states of consciousness,
like meditation? Does flow arising from physical
activities like sports recruit the same brain areas
as more mental tasks like writing or math? And scientists are still working
to understand why certain activities are more likely to elicit flow
than others. While we don't know for sure,
there are several theories. For example, people more often report
finding flow when doing things they find intrinsically motivating, meaning activities they find purpose,
meaning, or enjoyment in. This may include participating
in a favorite hobby, but also tackling gratifying
assignments at work, studying topics you find interesting,
or even completing satisfying chores. Likewise, it may be more difficult
to find flow in tasks you do only because you have to, 
not because you want to. Other research suggests balancing
personal skill level with the activity’s challenge
is key for finding flow. In other words, if a task is too easy,
you may get distracted or feel bored. If it’s too challenging,
you may become discouraged. The classically mesmerizing game
of Tetris, for example, keeps skill-challenge levels in balance
by increasing the fall speed of blocks as players get better at the game. Still, other studies suggest 
that it’s most important that activities have clear goals and allow you to assess
your progress along the way. For example, practicing a song allows
you to gauge your performance with each note. This also may be why people find
flow when playing games of chance, even though those games
don't require skill. Moment-to-moment feedback may be enough
to motivate deep engagement. While no single protocol
can guarantee flow, there are steps you can take
to increase your chances. Find a quiet environment free
from distracting noises or devices. Break your tasks into small, specific
segments that are easy to track and learn from. Set clear end goals that are
challenging but not frustratingly so. If you find the task to be tedious, set additional parameters
to up the stakes. For example, when cleaning your dishes, attempt to finish them all
in a certain amount of time. When running, try to keep pace
with the beat of a song. Most importantly,
and perhaps most frustratingly, don't focus too much on reaching flow. That sort of distraction might just
prevent you from finding it.
