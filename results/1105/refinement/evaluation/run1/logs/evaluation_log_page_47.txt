**Transcript**:
"Hi, Bob." "Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great." Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells,
that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose. As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell 
separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction 
of the smell's source so that within the first 
few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not
just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue 
divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing 
and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot. And everything in the street,
every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much 
more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various 
emotional states, and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby, and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something
at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish. In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness
to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us 
to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences 
the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to GPS technology, atomic clocks, and physics, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the number of specialized olfactory receptor cells in dogs.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that Question 5 is the closest match. This question asks about a specific numerical value (the characteristic clock frequency of cesium 133 atoms) and provides multiple-choice options with different numerical values.

But please note that the content and intent of Question 5 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

Index of the most similar generated MCQ: 5 (with a big caveat that it's not similar at all in terms of content and intent)

divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing 
and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot. And everything in the street,
every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much 
more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various 
emotional states, and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby, and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something
at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish. In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness
to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us 
to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences 
the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes.

How does your smartphone
know exactly where you are? The answer lies 12,000 miles 
over your head in an orbiting satellite that keeps time
to the beat of an atomic clock powered by quantum mechanics. Phew. Let's break that down. First of all, why is it so important 
to know what time it is on a satellite when location is what
we're concerned about? The first thing 
your phone needs to determine is how far it is from a satellite. Each satellite constantly 
broadcasts radio signals that travel from space to your phone
at the speed of light. Your phone records 
the signal arrival time and uses it to calculate 
the distance to the satellite using the simple formula,
distance = c x time, where c is the speed of light
and time is how long the signal traveled. But there's a problem. Light is incredibly fast. If we were only able to calculate 
time to the nearest second, every location on Earth, and far beyond, would seem to be the same 
distance from the satellite. So in order to calculate that distance
to within a few dozen feet, we need the best clock ever invented. Enter atomic clocks,
some of which are so precise that they would not gain or lose a second even if they ran 
for the next 300 million years. Atomic clocks work 
because of quantum physics. All clocks must have a constant frequency. In other words, a clock must carry out
some repetitive action to mark off equivalent increments of time. Just as a grandfather clock 
relies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum 
under gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition 
between two energy levels of an atom. This is where quantum physics 
comes into play. Quantum mechanics 
says that atoms carry energy, but they can't take on 
just any arbitrary amount. Instead, atomic energy 
is constrained to a precise set of levels. We call these quanta. As a simple analogy, 
think about driving a car onto a freeway. As you increase your speed, you would normally continuously go 
from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour. Now, if you had a quantum atomic car, you wouldn't accelerate 
in a linear fashion. Instead, you would instantaneously jump,
or transition, from one speed to the next. For an atom, when a transition 
occurs from one energy level to another, quantum mechanics says that the energy difference 
is equal to a characteristic frequency, multiplied by a constant, where the change in energy is equal to 
a number, called Planck's constant, times the frequency. That characteristic frequency 
is what we need to make our clock. GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium
atoms as frequency standards. In the case of cesium 133, the characteristic clock frequency
is 9,192,631,770 Hz. That's 9 billion cycles per second. That's a really fast clock. No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be, every pendulum, wind-up mechanism and quartz crystal resonates 
at a slightly different frequency. However, every cesium 133 atom 
in the universe oscillates at the same exact frequency. So thanks to the atomic clock, we get a time reading accurate
to within 1 billionth of a second, and a very precise measurement
of the distance from that satellite. Let's ignore the fact that you're almost
definitely on Earth. We now know that you're at a fixed 
distance from the satellite. In other words, you're somewhere 
on the surface of a sphere centered around the satellite. Measure your distance 
from a second satellite and you get another overlapping sphere. Keep doing that, and with just four measurements, and a little correction 
using Einstein's theory of relativity, you can pinpoint your location to exactly
one point in space. So that's all it takes: a multibillion-dollar 
network of satellites, oscillating cesium atoms, quantum mechanics, relativity, a smartphone, and you. No problem.

just any arbitrary amount. Instead, atomic energy 
is constrained to a precise set of levels. We call these quanta. As a simple analogy, 
think about driving a car onto a freeway. As you increase your speed, you would normally continuously go 
from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour. Now, if you had a quantum atomic car, you wouldn't accelerate 
in a linear fashion. Instead, you would instantaneously jump,
or transition, from one speed to the next. For an atom, when a transition 
occurs from one energy level to another, quantum mechanics says that the energy difference 
is equal to a characteristic frequency, multiplied by a constant, where the change in energy is equal to 
a number, called Planck's constant, times the frequency. That characteristic frequency 
is what we need to make our clock. GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium
atoms as frequency standards. In the case of cesium 133, the characteristic clock frequency
is 9,192,631,770 Hz. That's 9 billion cycles per second. That's a really fast clock. No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be, every pendulum, wind-up mechanism and quartz crystal resonates 
at a slightly different frequency. However, every cesium 133 atom 
in the universe oscillates at the same exact frequency. So thanks to the atomic clock, we get a time reading accurate
to within 1 billionth of a second, and a very precise measurement
of the distance from that satellite. Let's ignore the fact that you're almost
definitely on Earth. We now know that you're at a fixed 
distance from the satellite. In other words, you're somewhere 
on the surface of a sphere centered around the satellite. Measure your distance 
from a second satellite and you get another overlapping sphere. Keep doing that, and with just four measurements, and a little correction 
using Einstein's theory of relativity, you can pinpoint your location to exactly
one point in space. So that's all it takes: a multibillion-dollar 
network of satellites, oscillating cesium atoms, quantum mechanics, relativity, a smartphone, and you. No problem.

**Transcript**:
How does your smartphone
know exactly where you are? The answer lies 12,000 miles 
over your head in an orbiting satellite that keeps time
to the beat of an atomic clock powered by quantum mechanics. Phew. Let's break that down. First of all, why is it so important 
to know what time it is on a satellite when location is what
we're concerned about? The first thing 
your phone needs to determine is how far it is from a satellite. Each satellite constantly 
broadcasts radio signals that travel from space to your phone
at the speed of light. Your phone records 
the signal arrival time and uses it to calculate 
the distance to the satellite using the simple formula,
distance = c x time, where c is the speed of light
and time is how long the signal traveled. But there's a problem. Light is incredibly fast. If we were only able to calculate 
time to the nearest second, every location on Earth, and far beyond, would seem to be the same 
distance from the satellite. So in order to calculate that distance
to within a few dozen feet, we need the best clock ever invented. Enter atomic clocks,
some of which are so precise that they would not gain or lose a second even if they ran 
for the next 300 million years. Atomic clocks work 
because of quantum physics. All clocks must have a constant frequency. In other words, a clock must carry out
some repetitive action to mark off equivalent increments of time. Just as a grandfather clock 
relies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum 
under gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition 
between two energy levels of an atom. This is where quantum physics 
comes into play. Quantum mechanics 
says that atoms carry energy, but they can't take on 
just any arbitrary amount. Instead, atomic energy 
is constrained to a precise set of levels. We call these quanta. As a simple analogy, 
think about driving a car onto a freeway. As you increase your speed, you would normally continuously go 
from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour. Now, if you had a quantum atomic car, you wouldn't accelerate

You know how sometimes
you go to bake a cake but your bananas have all gone rotten, your utensils have rusted, you trip and pour all of your baking soda
into the vinegar jug, and then your oven explodes? My friend, you and your chemical reactions
have fallen victim to enthalpy and entropy and, boy, are they forces 
to be reckoned with. Now, your reactants are all products. So, what are these "E" words,
and what's their big idea? Let's start with enthalpy, an increase or decrease of energy
during a chemical reaction. Every molecule has a certain amount
of chemical potential energy stored within the bonds between its atoms. Chemicals with more energy 
are less stable, and thus, more likely to react. Let's visualize the energy flow 
in a reaction, the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen,
by playing a round of crazy golf. Our goal is to get a ball, the reactant,
up a small rise and down the other much steeper slope. Where the hill goes up,
we need to add energy to the ball, and where it goes down, the ball releases
energy into its surroundings. The hole represents the product,
or result of the reaction. When the reaction period ends,
the ball is inside the hole, and we have our product: water. This, like when our oven exploded,
is an exothermic reaction, meaning that the chemical's final energy
is less than its starting energy, and the difference has been added
to the surrounding environment as light and heat. We can also play out
the opposite type of reaction, an endothermic reaction, where the final energy is greater 
than the starting energy. That's what we were trying 
to achieve by baking our cake. The added heat from the oven would 
change the chemical structure of the proteins in the eggs
and various compounds in the butter. So that's enthalpy. As you might suspect, exothermic reactions are more likely 
to happen than endothermic ones because they require less energy to occur. But there's another independent factor
that can make reactions happen: entropy. Entropy measures a chemical's randomness. Here's an enormous pyramid of golf balls. Its ordered structure 
means it has low entropy. However, when it collapses, 
we have chaos everywhere, balls bouncing high and wide. So much so that some 
even go over the hill. This shift to instability, 
or higher entropy, can allow reactions to happen. As with the golf balls, 
in actual chemicals this transition from structure to disorder
gets some reactants past the hump and lets them start a reaction. You can see both enthalpy
and entropy at play when you go to light 
a campfire to cook dinner. Your match adds enough energy to activate the exothermic reaction
of combustion, converting the high-energy 
combustible material in the wood to lower energy carbon dioxide and water. Entropy also increases
and helps the reaction along because the neat, organized log of wood is now converted into randomly moving
water vapor and carbon dioxide. The energy shed by this 
exothermic reaction powers the endothermic reaction
of cooking your dinner. Bon appétit!

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Imagine that day by day, your field of vision 
becomes slightly smaller, narrowing or dimming until eventually you go completely blind. We tend to think of blindness
as something you're born with, but in fact, with many diseases
like Retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, blindness can start developing
when you're a kid, or even when you're an adult. Both of these rare genetic diseases
affect the retina, the screen at the back of the eye
that detects light and helps us see. Now imagine if the eye 
could regenerate itself so that a blind person could see again. To understand if that's possible,
we need to grasp how the retina works and what it has to do 
with a multitalented creature named the zebrafish. The human retina is made
of different layers of cells, with special neurons 
that live in the back of the eye called rod and cone photoreceptors. Photoreceptors convert 
the light coming into your eye into signals that the brain uses 
to generate vision. People who have Usher syndrome
and retinitis pigmentosa experience a steady loss 
of these photoreceptors until finally that screen in the eye
can no longer detect light nor broadcast signals to the brain. Unlike most of your body's cells,
photoreceptors don't divide and multiply. We're born with all 
the photoreceptors we'll ever have, which is why babies 
have such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish,
a master regenerator. It can grow back its skin, bones, heart
and retina after they've been damaged. If photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina
are removed or killed by toxins, they just regenerate and rewire 
themselves to the brain to restore sight. Scientists have been investigating
this superpower because zebrafish retina are also 
structured very much like human retina. Scientists can even mimic the effects
of disorders like Usher syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa
on the zebrafish eye. This allows them to see how zebrafish
go about repairing their retinas so they might use similar tactics
to fix human eyes one day, too. So what's behind 
the zebrafish's superpower? The main players are sets of long cells
that stretch across the retina called Müller glia. When the photoreceptors are damaged,
these cells transform, taking on a new character. They become less like Müller cells
and more like stem cells, which can turn into any kind of cell. Then these long cells divide, producing extras that will eventually
grow into new photoreceptors, travel to the back of the eye
and rewire themselves into the brain. And now some researchers even think
they've found the key to how this works with the help of one of two chemicals
that create activity in the brain called glutamate
and aminoadipate. In mouse eyes, these make the Müller glia divide
and transform into photoreceptors, which then travel 
to the back of the retina, like they're replenishing a failing army
with new soldiers. But remember, none of this has happened
in our retinas yet, so the question is how do we trigger 
this transformation of the Müller glia in the human eye? How can we fully control this process? How do photoreceptors 
rewire themselves into the retina? And is it even possible 
to trigger this in humans? Or has this mechanism been lost
over time in evolution? Until we tease apart 
the origins of this ability, retinal regeneration will remain 
a mysterious superpower of the common zebrafish.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Imagine that day by day, your field of vision 
becomes slightly smaller, narrowing or dimming until eventually you go completely blind. We tend to think of blindness
as something you're born with, but in fact, with many diseases
like Retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, blindness can start developing
when you're a kid, or even when you're an adult. Both of these rare genetic diseases
affect the retina, the screen at the back of the eye
that detects light and helps us see. Now imagine if the eye 
could regenerate itself so that a blind person could see again. To understand if that's possible,
we need to grasp how the retina works and what it has to do 
with a multitalented creature named the zebrafish. The human retina is made
of different layers of cells, with special neurons 
that live in the back of the eye called rod and cone photoreceptors. Photoreceptors convert 
the light coming into your eye into signals that the brain uses 
to generate vision. People who have Usher syndrome
and retinitis pigmentosa experience a steady loss 
of these photoreceptors until finally that screen in the eye
can no longer detect light nor broadcast signals to the brain. Unlike most of your body's cells,
photoreceptors don't divide and multiply. We're born with all 
the photoreceptors we'll ever have, which is why babies 
have such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish,
a master regenerator. It can grow back its skin, bones, heart
and retina after they've been damaged. If photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina
are removed or killed by toxins, they just regenerate and rewire 
themselves to the brain to restore sight. Scientists have been investigating
this superpower because zebrafish retina are also 
structured very much like human retina. Scientists can even mimic the effects
of disorders like Usher syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa
on the zebrafish eye. This allows them to see how zebrafish
go about repairing their retinas so they might use similar tactics
to fix human eyes one day, too. So what's behind 
the zebrafish's superpower? The main players are sets of long cells
that stretch across the retina called Müller glia. When the photoreceptors are damaged,
these cells transform, taking on a new character. They become less like Müller cells
and more like stem cells, which can turn into any kind of cell. Then these long cells divide, producing extras that will eventually
grow into new photoreceptors, travel to the back of the eye
and rewire themselves into the brain. And now some researchers even think
they've found the key to how this works with the help of one of two chemicals
that create activity in the brain called glutamate
and aminoadipate. In mouse eyes, these make the Müller glia divide
and transform into photoreceptors, which then travel 
to the back of the retina, like they're replenishing a failing army
with new soldiers. But remember, none of this has happened
in our retinas yet, so the question is how do we trigger 
this transformation of the Müller glia in the human eye? How can we fully control this process? How do photoreceptors 
rewire themselves into the retina? And is it even possible 
to trigger this in humans? Or has this mechanism been lost
over time in evolution? Until we tease apart 
the origins of this ability, retinal regeneration will remain 
a mysterious superpower of the common zebrafish.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs closely match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The ground truth MCQ is related to the effects of Retinitis Pigmentosa and Usher's syndrome on patients' vision, while the generated MCQs seem to be related to brain function, sleep, and neural activity.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ, I would say that none of them match the ground truth MCQ. But if you insist on an answer, I would say Question 4 is the closest, but it's still not a good match.

A better approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the content of the transcript, which discusses the effects of Retinitis Pigmentosa and Usher's syndrome on the retina and the potential for retinal regeneration.

**Transcript**:
You probably don't need to be told 
how important your brain is. After all, every single thing 
you experience, your thoughts and your actions, your perceptions and your memories are processed here 
in your body's control center. But if this already seems like a lot
for a single organ to handle, it's actually only a small 
part of what the brain does. Most of its activities are ones 
you'd never be aware of, unless they suddenly stopped. The brain is made up 
of billions of neurons, and trillions of connections. Neurons can be activated 
by specific stimuli or thoughts, but they are also often 
spontaneously active. Some fire cyclically in a set pattern. Others fire rapidly in short bursts 
before switching off, or remain quiet for long periods until thousands of inputs from other 
neurons line up in just the right way. On a large scale, this results in elaborate rhythms 
of internally generated brain activity, humming quietly in the background whether we're awake, asleep, or trying not to think 
about anything at all. And these spontaneously 
occurring brain functions form the foundation upon which
all other brain functions rely. The most crucial of these automatically
occurring activities are the ones that keep us alive. For example, while you've been
paying attention to this video spontaneous activity in your brain
has been maintaining your breathing at 12 to 16 breaths a minute,
making sure that you don't suffocate. Without any conscious effort, signals from parts of your brainstem
are sent through the spinal cord to the muscles that inflate your lungs, making them expand and contract,
whether or not you're paying attention. The neuronal circuits underlying such 
rhythmic spontaneous activity are called central pattern generators, and control many 
simple repetitive behaviors, like breathing, walking, and swallowing. Ongoing neural activity also underlies
our sensory perception. It may seem that the neurons in your retina
that translate light into neural signals would remain quiet in the dark, but in fact, the retinal ganglion cells 
that communicate with the brain are always active. And the signals they send are increases 
and decreases in the rate of activity, rather than separate bursts. So at every level, our nervous system
is teeming with spontaneous activity that helps it interpret and respond
to any signals it might receive. And our brain's autopilot isn't just 
limited to our basic biological functions. Have you ever been on the way home, started thinking 
about what's for dinner, and then realized you don't remember
walking for the past five minutes? While we don't understand all the details, we do know that the ongoing activity
in multiple parts of your brain is somehow able to coordinate 
what is actually a complex task involving both cognitive 
and motor functions, guiding you down the right path
and moving your legs while you're getting dinner figured out. But perhaps the most interesting thing
about spontaneous brain function is its involvement in one 
of the most mysterious and poorly understood phenomena
of our bodies: sleep. You may shut down 
and become inactive at night, but your brain doesn't. While you sleep, ongoing spontaneous activity gradually 
becomes more and more synchronized, eventually developing into large, 
rhythmic neural oscillations that envelop your brain. This transition to the more 
organized rhythms of sleep starts with small clusters of neurons
tucked in the hypothalamus. Despite their small number, these neurons have a huge effect in turning off brainstem regions
that normally keep you awake and alert, letting other parts, 
like the cortex and thalamus, slowly slip into their 
own default rhythms. The deeper we fall into sleep, the slower and more synchronized
this rhythm becomes, with the deepest stages dominated by large
amplitude, low frequency delta waves. But surprisingly, in the middle 
of this slow wave sleep, the brain's synchronized 
spontaneous activity repeatedly transitions
into the sort of varied bursts that occur when we're wide awake. This is the sleep stage
known as REM sleep, where our eyes move rapidly 
back and forth as we dream. Neuroscientists are still trying to answer
many fundamental questions about sleep, such as its role in rejuvenating
cognitive capacity, cellular homeostasis, and strengthening memory. And more broadly, they are exploring how it is that brain can accomplish 
such important and complex tasks, such as driving, or even breathing,
without our awareness. But for now, until we are better able to understand the inner workings
of their spontaneous functioning, we need to give our brains credit
for being much smarter than we ourselves are.

**Transcript**:
You probably don't need to be told 
how important your brain is. After all, every single thing 
you experience, your thoughts and your actions, your perceptions and your memories are processed here 
in your body's control center. But if this already seems like a lot
for a single organ to handle, it's actually only a small 
part of what the brain does. Most of its activities are ones 
you'd never be aware of, unless they suddenly stopped. The brain is made up 
of billions of neurons, and trillions of connections. Neurons can be activated 
by specific stimuli or thoughts, but they are also often 
spontaneously active. Some fire cyclically in a set pattern. Others fire rapidly in short bursts 
before switching off, or remain quiet for long periods until thousands of inputs from other 
neurons line up in just the right way. On a large scale, this results in elaborate rhythms 
of internally generated brain activity, humming quietly in the background whether we're awake, asleep, or trying not to think 
about anything at all. And these spontaneously 
occurring brain functions form the foundation upon which
all other brain functions rely. The most crucial of these automatically
occurring activities are the ones that keep us alive. For example, while you've been
paying attention to this video spontaneous activity in your brain
has been maintaining your breathing at 12 to 16 breaths a minute,
making sure that you don't suffocate. Without any conscious effort, signals from parts of your brainstem
are sent through the spinal cord to the muscles that inflate your lungs, making them expand and contract,
whether or not you're paying attention. The neuronal circuits underlying such 
rhythmic spontaneous activity are called central pattern generators, and control many 
simple repetitive behaviors, like breathing, walking, and swallowing. Ongoing neural activity also underlies
our sensory perception. It may seem that the neurons in your retina
that translate light into neural signals would remain quiet in the dark, but in fact, the retinal ganglion cells 
that communicate with the brain are always active. And the signals they send are increases 
and decreases in the rate of activity, rather than separate bursts. So at every level, our nervous system
is teeming with spontaneous activity that helps it interpret and respond

limited to our basic biological functions. Have you ever been on the way home, started thinking 
about what's for dinner, and then realized you don't remember

**Transcript**:
You probably don't need to be told 
how important your brain is. After all, every single thing 
you experience, your thoughts and your actions, your perceptions and your memories are processed here 
in your body's control center. But if this already seems like a lot
for a single organ to handle, it's actually only a small 
part of what the brain does. Most of its activities are ones 
you'd never be aware of, unless they suddenly stopped. The brain is made up 
of billions of neurons, and trillions of connections. Neurons can be activated 
by specific stimuli or thoughts, but they are also often 
spontaneously active. Some fire cyclically in a set pattern. Others fire rapidly in short bursts 
before switching off, or remain quiet for long periods until thousands of inputs from other 
neurons line up in just the right way. On a large scale, this results in elaborate rhythms 
of internally generated brain activity, humming quietly in the background whether we're awake, asleep, or trying not to think 
about anything at all. And these spontaneously 
occurring brain functions form the foundation upon which
all other brain functions rely. The most crucial of these automatically
occurring activities are the ones that keep us alive. For example, while you've been
paying attention to this video spontaneous activity in your brain
has been maintaining your breathing at 12 to 16 breaths a minute,
making sure that you don't suffocate. Without any conscious effort, signals from parts of your brainstem
are sent through the spinal cord to the muscles that inflate your lungs, making them expand and contract,
whether or not you're paying attention. The neuronal circuits underlying such 
rhythmic spontaneous activity are called central pattern generators, and control many 
simple repetitive behaviors, like breathing, walking, and swallowing. Ongoing neural activity also underlies
our sensory perception. It may seem that the neurons in your retina
that translate light into neural signals would remain quiet in the dark, but in fact, the retinal ganglion cells 
that communicate with the brain are always active. And the signals they send are increases 
and decreases in the rate of activity, rather than separate bursts. So at every level, our nervous system
is teeming with spontaneous activity that helps it interpret and respond
to any signals it might receive. And our brain's autopilot isn't just 
limited to our basic biological functions. Have you ever been on the way home, started thinking 
about what's for dinner, and then realized you don't remember
walking for the past five minutes? While we don't understand all the details, we do know that the ongoing activity
in multiple parts of your brain is somehow able to coordinate 
what is actually a complex task involving both cognitive 
and motor functions, guiding you down the right path
and moving your legs while you're getting dinner figured out. But perhaps the most interesting thing
about spontaneous brain function is its involvement in one 
of the most mysterious and poorly understood phenomena
of our bodies: sleep. You may shut down 
and become inactive at night, but your brain doesn't. While you sleep, ongoing spontaneous activity gradually 
becomes more and more synchronized, eventually developing into large, 
rhythmic neural oscillations that envelop your brain. This transition to the more 
organized rhythms of sleep starts with small clusters of neurons
tucked in the hypothalamus. Despite their small number, these neurons have a huge effect in turning off brainstem regions
that normally keep you awake and alert, letting other parts, 
like the cortex and thalamus, slowly slip into their 
own default rhythms. The deeper we fall into sleep, the slower and more synchronized
this rhythm becomes, with the deepest stages dominated by large
amplitude, low frequency delta waves. But surprisingly, in the middle 
of this slow wave sleep, the brain's synchronized 
spontaneous activity repeatedly transitions
into the sort of varied bursts that occur when we're wide awake. This is the sleep stage
known as REM sleep, where our eyes move rapidly 
back and forth as we dream. Neuroscientists are still trying to answer
many fundamental questions about sleep, such as its role in rejuvenating
cognitive capacity, cellular homeostasis, and strengthening memory. And more broadly, they are exploring how it is that brain can accomplish 
such important and complex tasks, such as driving, or even breathing,
without our awareness. But for now, until we are better able to understand the inner workings
of their spontaneous functioning, we need to give our brains credit
for being much smarter than we ourselves are.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: When we fall asleep the brain gradually transitions into slow, synchronized patterns of activity. This "slow wave sleep" is interrupted by more random, de-synchronized bursts of activity during what sleep stage?
Options: A. Stage 2, B. Stage 3, C. Stage 4, D. REM sleep
Correct Option: D

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner injected material from a cowpox virus
into an eight-year-old boy with a hunch that this would provide
the protection needed to save people from deadly outbreaks
of the related smallpox virus. It was a success. The eight-year-old was inoculated
against the disease and this became the first ever vaccine. But why did it work? To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system
defends us against contagious diseases in the first place. When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers
a series of responses in an attempt to identify
and remove them from our bodies. The signs that this immune
response is working are the coughing, sneezing,
inflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body
of threatening things, like bacteria. These innate immune responses
also trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity. Special cells called B cells and T cells
are recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what
the invaders look like, and how best to fight them. This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen
invades the body again. But despite this smart response,
there's still a risk involved. The body takes time to learn
how to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses. And even then, if a body is too weak or young
to fight back when it's invaded, it might face very serious risk
if the pathogen is particularly severe. But what if we could prepare
the body's immune response, readying it before someone even got ill? This is where vaccines come in. Using the same principles
that the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger
the body's adaptive immune system, without exposing humans
to the full strength disease. This has resulted in many vaccines,
which each work uniquely, separated into many different types. First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself
but a much weaker and tamer version. Next, we have inactive vaccines,
in which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation
in both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don't develop
into the full blown disease. But just like a disease,
they trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile
of pathogens in preparation. The downside is that live attenuated
vaccines can be difficult to make, and because they're live
and quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems
can't have them, while inactive vaccines
don't create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part
of the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers
the immune response. By even further isolating
specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt
specific responses. Scientists are now building
a whole new range of vaccines called DNA vaccines. For this variety, they isolate the very
genes that make the specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune
response to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells
in the body to make the antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body
for any future threats, and because the vaccine only includes
specific genetic material, it doesn't contain any other ingredients
from the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease
and harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success, we might be able to build
more effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come. Just like Edward Jenner's
amazing discovery spurred on modern medicine
all those decades ago, continuing the development of vaccines might even allow us
to treat diseases like HIV, malaria, or Ebola, one day.

**Transcript**:
In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner injected material from a cowpox virus
into an eight-year-old boy with a hunch that this would provide
the protection needed to save people from deadly outbreaks
of the related smallpox virus. It was a success. The eight-year-old was inoculated
against the disease and this became the first ever vaccine. But why did it work? To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system
defends us against contagious diseases in the first place. When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers
a series of responses in an attempt to identify
and remove them from our bodies. The signs that this immune
response is working are the coughing, sneezing,
inflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body
of threatening things, like bacteria. These innate immune responses
also trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity. Special cells called B cells and T cells
are recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what
the invaders look like, and how best to fight them. This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen
invades the body again. But despite this smart response,
there's still a risk involved. The body takes time to learn
how to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses. And even then, if a body is too weak or young
to fight back when it's invaded, it might face very serious risk
if the pathogen is particularly severe. But what if we could prepare
the body's immune response, readying it before someone even got ill? This is where vaccines come in. Using the same principles
that the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger
the body's adaptive immune system, without exposing humans
to the full strength disease. This has resulted in many vaccines,
which each work uniquely, separated into many different types. First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself
but a much weaker and tamer version. Next, we have inactive vaccines,
in which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation
in both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don't develop
into the full blown disease. But just like a disease,
they trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile
of pathogens in preparation. The downside is that live attenuated
vaccines can be difficult to make, and because they're live
and quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems
can't have them, while inactive vaccines
don't create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part
of the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers
the immune response. By even further isolating
specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt
specific responses. Scientists are now building
a whole new range of vaccines called DNA vaccines. For this variety, they isolate the very
genes that make the specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune
response to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells
in the body to make the antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body
for any future threats, and because the vaccine only includes
specific genetic material, it doesn't contain any other ingredients
from the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease
and harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success, we might be able to build
more effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come. Just like Edward Jenner's
amazing discovery spurred on modern medicine
all those decades ago, continuing the development of vaccines might even allow us
to treat diseases like HIV, malaria, or Ebola, one day.

**Transcript**:
The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere 
from a few photons to direct sunlight, or switch focus from 
the screen in front of you to the distant horizon 
in a third of a second. In fact, the structures required
for such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged
that the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd in the 
highest possible degree. And yet, that is exactly what happened,
starting more than 500 million years ago. The story of the human eye begins
with a simple light spot, such as the one found 
in single-celled organisms, like euglena. This is a cluster 
of light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's flagellum, activating when it finds light
and, therefore, food. A more complex version of this light spot
can be found in the flat worm, planaria. Being cupped, rather than flat, enables it to better sense
the direction of the incoming light. Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism
to seek out shade and hide from predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper
in some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing
a thin beam of light into the eye. The nautilus, 
an ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows
for simple images, the key step towards the eye 
as we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering 
the opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity
and processing. Crystalline proteins 
forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina. It is this lens that is the key
to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera
with a lens served as the basis for what would 
eventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount 
of light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer,
known as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete 
a protective film. But equally important was the accompanying evolution
of the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper
and more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces
of its step by step evolution. For example,
the human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away
from the eye opening. This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve
must pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive 
layer in the back. The similar looking eyes 
of cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina,
allowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections
for looking above and under water, perfect for spotting 
both predators and prey. Cats, classically nighttime hunters,
have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light
the eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision,
as well as their signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom. So if you could design an eye, 
would you do it any differently? This question isn't as strange 
as it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking
at different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants
for the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision
and flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass
its own evolution.

**Transcript**:
The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere 
from a few photons to direct sunlight, or switch focus from 
the screen in front of you to the distant horizon 
in a third of a second. In fact, the structures required
for such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged
that the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd in the 
highest possible degree. And yet, that is exactly what happened,
starting more than 500 million years ago. The story of the human eye begins
with a simple light spot, such as the one found 
in single-celled organisms, like euglena. This is a cluster 
of light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's flagellum, activating when it finds light
and, therefore, food. A more complex version of this light spot
can be found in the flat worm, planaria. Being cupped, rather than flat, enables it to better sense
the direction of the incoming light. Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism
to seek out shade and hide from predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper
in some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing
a thin beam of light into the eye. The nautilus, 
an ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows
for simple images, the key step towards the eye 
as we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering 
the opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity
and processing. Crystalline proteins 
forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina. It is this lens that is the key
to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera
with a lens served as the basis for what would 
eventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount 
of light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer,
known as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete 
a protective film. But equally important was the accompanying evolution
of the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper
and more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces
of its step by step evolution. For example,
the human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away
from the eye opening. This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve
must pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive 
layer in the back. The similar looking eyes 
of cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina,
allowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections
for looking above and under water, perfect for spotting 
both predators and prey. Cats, classically nighttime hunters,
have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light
the eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision,
as well as their signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom. So if you could design an eye, 
would you do it any differently? This question isn't as strange 
as it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking
at different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants
for the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision
and flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass
its own evolution.

to seek out shade and hide from predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper
in some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing
a thin beam of light into the eye. The nautilus, 
an ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows
for simple images, the key step towards the eye 
as we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering 
the opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity
and processing. Crystalline proteins 
forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina. It is this lens that is the key
to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera
with a lens served as the basis for what would 
eventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount 
of light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer,
known as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete 
a protective film. But equally important was the accompanying evolution
of the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper
and more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces
of its step by step evolution. For example,
the human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away
from the eye opening. This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve
must pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive 
layer in the back. The similar looking eyes 
of cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina,
allowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections
for looking above and under water, perfect for spotting 
both predators and prey. Cats, classically nighttime hunters,
have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light
the eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision,
as well as their signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom. So if you could design an eye, 
would you do it any differently? This question isn't as strange 
as it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking
at different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants
for the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision
and flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass
its own evolution.

**Transcript**:
Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So today I'm in California and I have the great privilege of introducing the MAN... Alan Sailer.
- Hello
- Alan Sailer is, if you don't know, one of the best high speed photographers that currently does the art. So I'm here in his garden, back behind his house, and we're going to basically study explosions underwater with some firecrackers. (Destin) You typically do it with the high speed photography method right?
- Yeah it's just a instant of detonation and I'm really looking forward to seeing uh... time.
- Yeah exactly it's not just one moment. (Destin) This is a M320 Miro Phantom camera and what do you hope to learn here?
(Alan) I just want to be impressed, so uh.. do it. 3..2..1..0 [bang] Alright! [laughs] - Pretty cool. Let's look at the video. [music] - Oh yeah
- Ripple.
- Yeah. OK so we decided we wanted a lower exposure time and also a higher frame rate so what we're gonna do is we're gonna change the lens. 3..2..1..0.. [bang] [falling debris]
- about 20 feet...
- Yep. Man the uh.. I wonder if that was from impact or if the bottle itself...
- No it sucks in... There's cavitation appears on the top if you looked at the photograph.
-Yeah? Alright let's just look at the video. Alright. I have a scientific mystery that I need your help figuring out. Let's first define what an explosion is. Right? So basically it's a rapid formation of gas and you have it contained in some type of mechanical device and it increases pressure. And that mechanical restraining device will eventually fail and blow outwards, correct? But here's the question. After each shot I would go find the bottle on the ground and the bottle would be sucked in on the top instead of blown out like you would think. This is counter intuitive and we have to figure out why. My theory is that as the bottle blows up on the bottom it begins to shoot up like a rocket, and when it does this it starts to wrinkle like grandma legs if you can see it, as it pushes the rest of the bottle forward. Now the cap has more mass than the side walls of the bottle, so my theory was that the bottle was pushing the cap, but the cap weighs too much and so the bottle is out-running the cap. Alan on the other hand disagreed with me. My position is that after detonation there's nothing but high pressure in the bottle, but Alan referenced me back to some of his photos from his Flickr stream. He always sees bubbles after detonation. Always. What causes bubbles to form in a liquid? Of course. Cavitation. A phase diagram is a fancy chart that uses pressure and temperature to describe what state the matter should be in. We're located about right here which is 23 degrees celcius. Now there's only a couple of ways we can go from liquid over to vapor. One is we can move along the right here and increase the temperature I don't think we're heating the water up enough in order to do that, so I would conclude that Alan is correct. I believe we are lowering the pressure enough that we go beyond this vapor boundary and turn into vapor. And all we have to do to turn it back into a liquid is repressurize. OK let's look at the cavitation. Immediately after detonation we're seeing bubbles all over the bottle. That's interesting but 150 microseconds later on the next frame, all the bubbles seem to be confined in one area. Basically the shock waves are bouncing off the sides of the cylindrical bottle on the inside and they're bouncing back toward each other and then they're interfering with each other and creating a low pressure spot. I think that's pretty cool because you can already see the cap beginning to suck in. On the next frame you can see what I call the "Wrinkly Grandma Leg Effect." Now I think it's pretty interesting that the bubble is collapsing from the left to the right, which might mean that's a compression wave going towards the front of the bottle, but what's confusing to me is the cap of the bottle is still being sucked in. So I convinced Alan to do a self-portrait with me but what I didn't realize is this self-portrait would reveal more information than any of the other videos. At the point of detonation clearly we have high pressure in the bottle. Then you can see the lid suck in and then.. check that out. The lid shoots off. So that implies to me that you have low pressure, and then high pressure. Once the fluid is blown out of the bottom of that bottle, it begins to pull fluid out of the top of the bottle with it. So we have an oscillation in pressure Where have we seen something like that before? Sometimes when I'm drinking with a straw I like to put my finger over the end of the straw and bring the fluid up out of the cup. And then I'll release my finger and watch what the liquid does. It oscillates. That's pretty cool and I think that's caused by fluid momentum or the inertia of the fluid itself. So this momentum effect of fluid applies to what we're doing too. As the fluid is blown out of the bottom of that bottle you can see that it starts to pull liquid out of the top of the bottle and collapse the side walls of the bottle. That's pretty cool too. So seriously, thanks for your time. It's way more fun to think this through with you. Anyway, if you want the high speed footage feel free to download it. Draw me some pictures and show me what you think the shock waves are doing on the video. This guy did it. I don't think he's exactly right but he took a good stab at it. I'm Destin. You're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. 2..1..0.. [bang] By the way, Alan Sailer grows very good apricots. The Russians have developed a way to use cavitation to create a bubble on the front of the torpedo. This is called super cavitation. If you fly the torpedo in that bubble you have way less drag and you can move that torpedo way fast. [ Captions by Andrew Jackson ]

**Transcript**:
As 1905 dawned, the soon-to-be 26-year-old Albert Einstein
faced life as a failed academic. Most physicists of the time
would have scoffed at the idea that this minor civil servant
could have much to contribute to science. Yet within the following year, Einstein would publish not one, not two, not three, but four extraordinary papers,
each on a different topic, that were destined to radically transform
our understanding of the universe. The myth that Einstein
had failed math is just that. He had mastered calculus on his own
by the age of 15 and done well at both
his Munich secondary school and at the Swiss Polytechnic, where he studied for
a math and physics teaching diploma. But skipping classes to spend
more time in the lab and neglecting to show proper deference
to his professors had derailed his intended career path. Passed over even
for a lab assistant position, he had to settle for a job
at the Swiss patent office, obtained with the help
of a friend's father. Working six days a week as a patent clerk, Einstein still managed to make
some time for physics, discussing the latest work
with a few close friends, and publishing a couple of minor papers. It came as a major surprise when in March 1905 he submitted
a paper with a shocking hypothesis. Despite decades of evidence
that light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it could,
in fact, be a particle, showing that mysterious phenomena,
such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by his hypothesis. The idea was derided for years to come, but Einstein was simply
twenty years ahead of his time. Wave-particle duality was slated to become
a cornerstone of the quantum revolution. Two months later in May,
Einstein submitted a second paper, this time tackling the centuries old
question of whether atoms actually exist. Though certain theories were built on
the idea of invisible atoms, some prominent scientists still
believed them to be a useful fiction, rather than actual physical objects. But Einstein used an ingenious argument, showing that the behavior
of small particles randomly moving around in a liquid,
known as Brownian motion, could be precisely predicted by the collisions of millions
of invisible atoms. Experiments soon confirmed
Einstein's model, and atomic skeptics threw in the towel. The third paper came in June. For a long time, Einstein had been troubled
by an inconsistency between two fundamental
principles of physics. The well established
principle of relativity, going all the way back to Galileo, stated that absolute motion
could not be defined. Yet electromagnetic theory,
also well established, asserted that absolute motion did exist. The discrepancy,
and his inability to resolve it, left Einstein in what he described
as a state of psychic tension. But one day in May, after he had mulled over the puzzle
with his friend Michele Besso, the clouds parted. Einstein realized
that the contradiction could be resolved if it was the speed of light
that remained constant, regardless of reference frame, while both time and space
were relative to the observer. It took Einstein only a few weeks
to work out the details and formulate what came to be known
as special relativity. The theory not only shattered
our previous understanding of reality but would also pave the way
for technologies, ranging from particle accelerators, to the global positioning system. One might think that this was enough, but in September, a fourth paper arrived as a "by the way"
follow-up to the special relativity paper. Einstein had thought a little bit more
about his theory, and realized it also implied
that mass and energy, one apparently solid
and the other supposedly ethereal, were actually equivalent. And their relationship could be expressed
in what was to become the most famous and consequential equation in history: E=mc^2. Einstein would not become a world famous
icon for nearly another fifteen years. It was only after his later general theory
of relativity was confirmed in 1919 by measuring the bending of starlight
during a solar eclipse that the press would turn him
into a celebrity. But even if he had disappeared back
into the patent office and accomplished nothing else after 1905, those four papers of his miracle year would have remained the gold standard
of startling unexpected genius.

**Transcript**:
As 1905 dawned, the soon-to-be 26-year-old Albert Einstein
faced life as a failed academic. Most physicists of the time
would have scoffed at the idea that this minor civil servant
could have much to contribute to science. Yet within the following year, Einstein would publish not one, not two, not three, but four extraordinary papers,
each on a different topic, that were destined to radically transform
our understanding of the universe. The myth that Einstein
had failed math is just that. He had mastered calculus on his own
by the age of 15 and done well at both
his Munich secondary school and at the Swiss Polytechnic, where he studied for
a math and physics teaching diploma. But skipping classes to spend
more time in the lab and neglecting to show proper deference
to his professors had derailed his intended career path. Passed over even
for a lab assistant position, he had to settle for a job
at the Swiss patent office, obtained with the help
of a friend's father. Working six days a week as a patent clerk, Einstein still managed to make
some time for physics, discussing the latest work
with a few close friends, and publishing a couple of minor papers. It came as a major surprise when in March 1905 he submitted
a paper with a shocking hypothesis. Despite decades of evidence
that light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it could,
in fact, be a particle, showing that mysterious phenomena,
such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by his hypothesis. The idea was derided for years to come, but Einstein was simply
twenty years ahead of his time. Wave-particle duality was slated to become
a cornerstone of the quantum revolution. Two months later in May,
Einstein submitted a second paper, this time tackling the centuries old
question of whether atoms actually exist. Though certain theories were built on
the idea of invisible atoms, some prominent scientists still
believed them to be a useful fiction, rather than actual physical objects. But Einstein used an ingenious argument, showing that the behavior
of small particles randomly moving around in a liquid,
known as Brownian motion, could be precisely predicted by the collisions of millions
of invisible atoms. Experiments soon confirmed
Einstein's model, and atomic skeptics threw in the towel. The third paper came in June. For a long time, Einstein had been troubled
by an inconsistency between two fundamental
principles of physics. The well established
principle of relativity, going all the way back to Galileo, stated that absolute motion
could not be defined. Yet electromagnetic theory,
also well established, asserted that absolute motion did exist. The discrepancy,
and his inability to resolve it, left Einstein in what he described
as a state of psychic tension. But one day in May, after he had mulled over the puzzle
with his friend Michele Besso, the clouds parted. Einstein realized
that the contradiction could be resolved if it was the speed of light
that remained constant, regardless of reference frame, while both time and space
were relative to the observer. It took Einstein only a few weeks
to work out the details and formulate what came to be known
as special relativity. The theory not only shattered
our previous understanding of reality but would also pave the way
for technologies, ranging from particle accelerators, to the global positioning system. One might think that this was enough, but in September, a fourth paper arrived as a "by the way"
follow-up to the special relativity paper. Einstein had thought a little bit more
about his theory, and realized it also implied
that mass and energy, one apparently solid
and the other supposedly ethereal, were actually equivalent. And their relationship could be expressed
in what was to become the most famous and consequential equation in history: E=mc^2. Einstein would not become a world famous
icon for nearly another fifteen years. It was only after his later general theory
of relativity was confirmed in 1919 by measuring the bending of starlight
during a solar eclipse that the press would turn him
into a celebrity. But even if he had disappeared back
into the patent office and accomplished nothing else after 1905, those four papers of his miracle year would have remained the gold standard
of startling unexpected genius.

This holiday season, people around the world will give
and receive presents. You might even get 
a knitted sweater from an aunt. But what if instead of saying "thanks"
before consigning it to the closet, the polite response expected from you was to show up to her house 
in a week with a better gift? Or to vote for her in the town election? Or let her adopt your firstborn child? All of these things might not 
sound so strange if you are involved in a gift economy. This phrase might seem contradictory. After all, isn't a gift given for free? But in a gift economy,
gifts given without explicit conditions are used to foster a system
of social ties and obligations. While the market economies we know 
are formed by relationships between the things being traded, a gift economy consists 
of the relationships between the people doing the trading. Gift economies have existed 
throughout human history. The first studies of the concept came from anthropologists 
Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss who describe the natives 
of the Trobriand islands making dangerous canoe journeys 
across miles of ocean to exchange shell necklaces
and arm bands. The items traded through this process,
known as the kula ring, have no practical use, but derive importance 
from their original owners and carry an obligation 
to continue the exchange. Other gift economies 
may involve useful items, such as the potlatch feast 
of the Pacific Northwest, where chiefs compete for prestige 
by giving away livestock and blankets. We might say that instead 
of accumulating material wealth, participants in a gift economy 
use it to accumulate social wealth. Though some instances of gift economies
may resemble barter, the difference is that the original gift 
is given without any preconditions or haggling. Instead, the social norm of reciprocity obligates recipients to voluntarily 
return the favor. But the rules for how and when to do so 
vary between cultures, and the return on a gift 
can take many forms. A powerful chief giving 
livestock to a poor man may not expect goods in return, but gains social prestige 
at the debtor's expense. And among the Toraja people of Indonesia, the status gained from gift ceremonies 
even determines land ownership. The key is to keep the gift cycle going, with someone always 
indebted to someone else. Repaying a gift immediately, or with something of exactly equal value, may be read as ending 
the social relationship. So, are gift economies exclusive 
to small-scale societies outside the industrialized world? Not quite. For one thing, even in these cultures, gift economies function alongside 
a market system for other exchanges. And when we think about it, parts of our own societies 
work in similar ways. Communal spaces, such as Burning Man, operate as a mix of barter 
and a gift economy, where selling things 
for money is strictly taboo. In art and technology, gift economies are emerging 
as an alternative to intellectual property where artists, musicians, and open-source developers distribute their creative works, 
not for financial profit, but to raise their social profile 
or establish their community role. And even potluck dinners 
and holiday gift traditions involve some degree 
of reciprocity and social norms. We might wonder if a gift is truly a gift if it comes with obligations 
or involves some social pay off. But this is missing the point. Our idea of a free gift 
without social obligations prevails only if we already think 
of everything in market terms. And in a commericalized world, the idea of strengthening bonds 
through giving and reciprocity may not be such a bad thing,
wherever you may live.

a knitted sweater from an aunt. But what if instead of saying "thanks"

a knitted sweater from an aunt. But what if instead of saying "thanks"
before consigning it to the closet, the polite response expected from you was to show up to her house

sound so strange if you are involved in a gift economy. This phrase might seem contradictory. After all, isn't a gift given for free? But in a gift economy,
gifts given without explicit conditions are used to foster a system
of social ties and obligations. While the market economies we know 
are formed by relationships between the things being traded, a gift economy consists 
of the relationships between the people doing the trading. Gift economies have existed 
throughout human history. The first studies of the concept came from anthropologists 
Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss who describe the natives 
of the Trobriand islands making dangerous canoe journeys 
across miles of ocean to exchange shell necklaces
and arm bands. The items traded through this process,
known as the kula ring, have no practical use, but derive importance 
from their original owners and carry an obligation 
to continue the exchange. Other gift economies 
may involve useful items, such as the potlatch feast 
of the Pacific Northwest, where chiefs compete for prestige 
by giving away livestock and blankets. We might say that instead 
of accumulating material wealth, participants in a gift economy 
use it to accumulate social wealth. Though some instances of gift economies
may resemble barter, the difference is that the original gift 
is given without any preconditions or haggling. Instead, the social norm of reciprocity obligates recipients to voluntarily 
return the favor. But the rules for how and when to do so 
vary between cultures, and the return on a gift 
can take many forms. A powerful chief giving 
livestock to a poor man may not expect goods in return, but gains social prestige 
at the debtor's expense. And among the Toraja people of Indonesia, the status gained from gift ceremonies 
even determines land ownership. The key is to keep the gift cycle going, with someone always 
indebted to someone else. Repaying a gift immediately, or with something of exactly equal value, may be read as ending 
the social relationship. So, are gift economies exclusive 
to small-scale societies outside the industrialized world? Not quite. For one thing, even in these cultures, gift economies function alongside 
a market system for other exchanges. And when we think about it, parts of our own societies 
work in similar ways. Communal spaces, such as Burning Man, operate as a mix of barter 
and a gift economy, where selling things 
for money is strictly taboo. In art and technology, gift economies are emerging 
as an alternative to intellectual property where artists, musicians, and open-source developers distribute their creative works, 
not for financial profit, but to raise their social profile 
or establish their community role. And even potluck dinners 
and holiday gift traditions involve some degree 
of reciprocity and social norms. We might wonder if a gift is truly a gift if it comes with obligations 
or involves some social pay off. But this is missing the point. Our idea of a free gift 
without social obligations prevails only if we already think 
of everything in market terms. And in a commericalized world, the idea of strengthening bonds 
through giving and reciprocity may not be such a bad thing,
wherever you may live.

**Transcript**:
This holiday season, people around the world will give
and receive presents. You might even get 
a knitted sweater from an aunt. But what if instead of saying "thanks"
before consigning it to the closet, the polite response expected from you was to show up to her house 
in a week with a better gift? Or to vote for her in the town election? Or let her adopt your firstborn child? All of these things might not 
sound so strange if you are involved in a gift economy. This phrase might seem contradictory. After all, isn't a gift given for free? But in a gift economy,
gifts given without explicit conditions are used to foster a system
of social ties and obligations. While the market economies we know 
are formed by relationships between the things being traded, a gift economy consists 
of the relationships between the people doing the trading. Gift economies have existed 
throughout human history. The first studies of the concept came from anthropologists 
Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss who describe the natives 
of the Trobriand islands making dangerous canoe journeys 
across miles of ocean to exchange shell necklaces
and arm bands. The items traded through this process,
known as the kula ring, have no practical use, but derive importance 
from their original owners and carry an obligation 
to continue the exchange. Other gift economies 
may involve useful items, such as the potlatch feast 
of the Pacific Northwest, where chiefs compete for prestige 
by giving away livestock and blankets. We might say that instead 
of accumulating material wealth, participants in a gift economy 
use it to accumulate social wealth. Though some instances of gift economies
may resemble barter, the difference is that the original gift 
is given without any preconditions or haggling. Instead, the social norm of reciprocity obligates recipients to voluntarily 
return the favor. But the rules for how and when to do so 
vary between cultures, and the return on a gift 
can take many forms. A powerful chief giving 
livestock to a poor man may not expect goods in return, but gains social prestige 
at the debtor's expense. And among the Toraja people of Indonesia, the status gained from gift ceremonies 
even determines land ownership. The key is to keep the gift cycle going, with someone always 
indebted to someone else. Repaying a gift immediately, or with something of exactly equal value, may be read as ending 
the social relationship. So, are gift economies exclusive 
to small-scale societies outside the industrialized world? Not quite. For one thing, even in these cultures, gift economies function alongside 
a market system for other exchanges. And when we think about it, parts of our own societies 
work in similar ways. Communal spaces, such as Burning Man, operate as a mix of barter 
and a gift economy, where selling things 
for money is strictly taboo. In art and technology, gift economies are emerging 
as an alternative to intellectual property where artists, musicians, and open-source developers distribute their creative works, 
not for financial profit, but to raise their social profile 
or establish their community role. And even potluck dinners 
and holiday gift traditions involve some degree 
of reciprocity and social norms. We might wonder if a gift is truly a gift if it comes with obligations 
or involves some social pay off. But this is missing the point. Our idea of a free gift 
without social obligations prevails only if we already think 
of everything in market terms. And in a commericalized world, the idea of strengthening bonds 
through giving and reciprocity may not be such a bad thing,
wherever you may live.

**Transcript**:
Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property,
deprived of personal rights, has occurred in many forms 
throughout the world. But one institution stands out for
both its global scale and its lasting legacy. The Atlantic slave trade, occurring from the late 15th
to the mid 19th century and spanning three continents, forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans
to the Americas. The impact it would leave affected
not only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories
of large parts of the world. There had been centuries of contact
between Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean. But the Atlantic slave trade 
began in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement 
of the Americas shortly after. The crops grown in the new colonies,
sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers 
or indentured servants to cultivate all the new land. American Natives were enslaved, 
but many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted. And so to meet the massive 
demand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa. African slavery had existed 
for centuries in various forms. Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term 
and the chance to buy one's freedom. Others were more like European serfs. In some societies, slaves could 
be part of a master's family, own land, and even rise 
to positions of power. But when white captains came offering 
manufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants 
had little reason to hesitate. They viewed the people they sold 
not as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors, 
or prisoners of war from rival tribes. By selling them, kings enriched 
their own realms, and strengthened them 
against neighboring enemies. African kingdoms prospered 
from the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand
created intense competition. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves 
became a motivation for war, rather than its result. To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms 
needed European firearms, which they also bought with slaves. The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies 
across the continent. As for the slaves themselves,
they faced unimaginable brutality. After being marched 
to slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships 
bound for the Americas. About 20% of them 
would never see land again. Most captains of the day 
were tight packers, cramming as many men 
as possible below deck. While the lack of sanitation 
caused many to die of disease, and others were thrown 
overboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits 
by cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase. Some captives took matters 
into their own hands. Many inland Africans 
had never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away 
and returning for more. Afraid of being eaten, 
or just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide 
or starved themselves, believing that in death,
their souls would return home. Those who survived 
were completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo. Women and children were kept above deck
and abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised 
and curb rebellion. What happened to those Africans 
who reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery 
still affects their descendants today is fairly well known. But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade
had on Africa's future. Not only did the continent lose
tens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves 
taken were men, the long-term demographic 
effect was even greater. When the slave trade was finally 
outlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies 
it had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open 
to conquest and colonization. And the increased competition 
and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability 
that continues to this day. The Atlantic slave trade also contributed
to the development of racist ideology. Most African slavery had no deeper reason
than legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans 
who preached a universal religion, and who had long ago 
outlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds 
with their ideals of equality. So they claimed that 
Africans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts 
to justify this theory. Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas
acquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves 
and their future descendants to attain equal status in society. In all of these ways, the Atlantic slave trade 
was an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued 
long after its abolition.

not only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories
of large parts of the world. There had been centuries of contact
between Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean. But the Atlantic slave trade 
began in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement 
of the Americas shortly after. The crops grown in the new colonies,
sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers 
or indentured servants to cultivate all the new land. American Natives were enslaved, 
but many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted. And so to meet the massive 
demand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa. African slavery had existed 
for centuries in various forms. Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term 
and the chance to buy one's freedom. Others were more like European serfs. In some societies, slaves could 
be part of a master's family, own land, and even rise 
to positions of power. But when white captains came offering 
manufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants 
had little reason to hesitate. They viewed the people they sold 
not as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors, 
or prisoners of war from rival tribes. By selling them, kings enriched 
their own realms, and strengthened them 
against neighboring enemies. African kingdoms prospered 
from the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand
created intense competition. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves 
became a motivation for war, rather than its result. To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms 
needed European firearms, which they also bought with slaves. The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies 
across the continent. As for the slaves themselves,
they faced unimaginable brutality. After being marched 
to slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships 
bound for the Americas. About 20% of them 
would never see land again. Most captains of the day 
were tight packers, cramming as many men 
as possible below deck. While the lack of sanitation 
caused many to die of disease, and others were thrown 
overboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits 
by cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase. Some captives took matters 
into their own hands. Many inland Africans 
had never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away 
and returning for more. Afraid of being eaten, 
or just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide 
or starved themselves, believing that in death,
their souls would return home. Those who survived 
were completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo. Women and children were kept above deck
and abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised 
and curb rebellion. What happened to those Africans 
who reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery 
still affects their descendants today is fairly well known. But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade
had on Africa's future. Not only did the continent lose
tens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves 
taken were men, the long-term demographic 
effect was even greater. When the slave trade was finally 
outlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies 
it had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open 
to conquest and colonization. And the increased competition 
and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability 
that continues to this day. The Atlantic slave trade also contributed
to the development of racist ideology. Most African slavery had no deeper reason
than legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans 
who preached a universal religion, and who had long ago 
outlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds 
with their ideals of equality. So they claimed that 
Africans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts 
to justify this theory. Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas
acquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves 
and their future descendants to attain equal status in society. In all of these ways, the Atlantic slave trade 
was an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued 
long after its abolition.

**Transcript**:
Flying through the night, 
I watch over this world, a silent guardian, a watchful protector,
a dark knight, I'm... Okay, fine. So, I'm not Batman.
I'm just a bat. But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood. People think I'm scary, 
strange and dangerous. If they only knew my story, though,
I'd be cheered as a hero. When people think of bats, many think of vampires 
who want to suck their blood. But the truth is 
that out of over 1200 bat species, only three are vampire bats. Out of these three, 
only one prefers the blood of mammals, and even these bats mostly feed on cattle. Maybe that still doesn't seem so great, but vampire bats 
can be a great help to humans. A chemical known as desmoteplase 
found in vampire bat saliva helps break down blood clots, and is being tested 
by recovering stroke victims. Of the remaining 1000+ species of bats, 
about 70% feed on insects. These bats help control 
the real vampires: mosquitos, whose nasty bites
are not just annoying but spread diseases, like West Nile virus. A single little brown bat 
can eat 1000 insects every hour, and a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats 
can eat several tons of moths in just one night. In the United States alone, bats provide an estimated 
3.7 billion dollars worth of free pest control for farmers, which benefits everyone 
who eats the foods that they grow. Fruit bats, also called megabats 
because of their large size, are important for the role 
they play in plant pollination. By traveling between flowers 
while feeding on nectar and fruits, these bats transport the pollen 
and seeds that help plants reproduce. In Southeast Asia, for example, the cave nectar bat is the only pollinator
of the durian fruit. Other bats pollinate peaches, bananas, and the agave plants 
that tequila is made from. Without them, many of our food plants would be unable 
to produce the tasty fruits we enjoy. As heroes of the ecosystem, 
bats have their own unique utility belts. Bats have been a source of inspiration 
for the design of flying robots and even an energy-efficient spy plane, as they are the only mammal 
capable of true powered flight. Echolocation, a type of biological sonar,
is also used by bats as a way to navigate and find prey in the dark. Although there's a common 
misconception that bats are blind, in truth, all species of bats have sight. And some have even adapted 
large eyes to see better in dim lighting. Many people worry 
about getting infected by bats, and like any other animals,
bats can carry diseases, like rabies. In reality, though, less than .5% of all bats
carry this virus. That's about the same odds as getting 
the same result on a coin flip eight times in a row. The perception that bats 
are often diseased may come from the fact that sick bats, who may show unusual behavior, 
emerge during the daytime, or be unable to fly, are more likely to be 
encountered by people. So a good way to protect yourself 
is to protect bats as well, keeping them healthy,
protecting their habitats, and reducing their risk 
of transmitting disease. In North America, bats are threatened 
by a devastating sickness called white-nose syndrome. This fungal infection 
causes bats to wake up while hibernating during a winter. Unable to find food, 
they expend large amounts of energy, and eventually starve to death. White-nose syndrome has wiped out
entire caves full of bats, with a mortality rate that can exceed 90%. Climate change and habitat destruction also pose serious threats 
to bat populations. For example, in January 2014,
a record heat wave in Australia caused over 100,000 bats 
to die from heat exhaustion. Some people just want 
to watch the world burn, and bats all over the world are threatened
by damage to the places that we call home, including mangrove swamps, old-growth forests, and, of course, bat caves. So even though I'm the hero of the story,
I do need to be saved. And now that you know 
the true story about us bats, you can learn how to protect 
such heroic animals. Install a properly designed bat box, one of the easiest ways 
to provide shelter for bats. Discourage the use of pesticides,
which can harm bats when we try to feed on the insects 
you want to get rid of in the first place. Avoid going into caves 
where you might disturb hibernating bats, and always decontaminate 
your gear after visiting a cave. If you have unwanted bats 
living in an attic or barn, contact your local government 
to safely and humanely relocate us. And if you come across a bat, 
do not attempt to handle it, but instead, call Animal Control. Batman might want to keep 
his identity secret, but a great way to help real bats
is by continuing to learn about them and spreading the truth 
that they are real heroes, even if their good deeds are often unseen.

Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as the nature of life, entropy, and death.

If I had to choose one, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. The ground truth MCQ is asking about the number of species of bats that are true vampires, whereas the generated MCQs are asking about completely different topics.

However, I can suggest that a new set of generated MCQs be created that are relevant to the topic of bats and vampires. Here is an example of a generated MCQ that could match the ground truth MCQ:

Question: How many species of bats are known to feed on blood?
Options: A. 1, B. 3, C. 10, D. 100

This generated MCQ is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Flying through the night, 
I watch over this world, a silent guardian, a watchful protector,
a dark knight, I'm... Okay, fine. So, I'm not Batman.
I'm just a bat. But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood. People think I'm scary, 
strange and dangerous. If they only knew my story, though,
I'd be cheered as a hero. When people think of bats, many think of vampires 
who want to suck their blood. But the truth is 
that out of over 1200 bat species, only three are vampire bats. Out of these three, 
only one prefers the blood of mammals, and even these bats mostly feed on cattle. Maybe that still doesn't seem so great, but vampire bats 
can be a great help to humans. A chemical known as desmoteplase 
found in vampire bat saliva helps break down blood clots, and is being tested 
by recovering stroke victims. Of the remaining 1000+ species of bats, 
about 70% feed on insects. These bats help control 
the real vampires: mosquitos, whose nasty bites
are not just annoying but spread diseases, like West Nile virus. A single little brown bat 
can eat 1000 insects every hour, and a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats 
can eat several tons of moths in just one night. In the United States alone, bats provide an estimated 
3.7 billion dollars worth of free pest control for farmers, which benefits everyone 
who eats the foods that they grow. Fruit bats, also called megabats 
because of their large size, are important for the role 
they play in plant pollination. By traveling between flowers 
while feeding on nectar and fruits, these bats transport the pollen 
and seeds that help plants reproduce. In Southeast Asia, for example, the cave nectar bat is the only pollinator
of the durian fruit. Other bats pollinate peaches, bananas, and the agave plants 
that tequila is made from. Without them, many of our food plants would be unable 
to produce the tasty fruits we enjoy. As heroes of the ecosystem, 
bats have their own unique utility belts. Bats have been a source of inspiration 
for the design of flying robots and even an energy-efficient spy plane, as they are the only mammal 
capable of true powered flight. Echolocation, a type of biological sonar,
is also used by bats as a way to navigate and find prey in the dark. Although there's a common 
misconception that bats are blind, in truth, all species of bats have sight. And some have even adapted 
large eyes to see better in dim lighting. Many people worry 
about getting infected by bats, and like any other animals,
bats can carry diseases, like rabies. In reality, though, less than .5% of all bats
carry this virus. That's about the same odds as getting 
the same result on a coin flip eight times in a row. The perception that bats 
are often diseased may come from the fact that sick bats, who may show unusual behavior, 
emerge during the daytime, or be unable to fly, are more likely to be 
encountered by people. So a good way to protect yourself 
is to protect bats as well, keeping them healthy,
protecting their habitats, and reducing their risk 
of transmitting disease. In North America, bats are threatened 
by a devastating sickness called white-nose syndrome. This fungal infection 
causes bats to wake up while hibernating during a winter. Unable to find food, 
they expend large amounts of energy, and eventually starve to death. White-nose syndrome has wiped out
entire caves full of bats, with a mortality rate that can exceed 90%. Climate change and habitat destruction also pose serious threats 
to bat populations. For example, in January 2014,
a record heat wave in Australia caused over 100,000 bats 
to die from heat exhaustion. Some people just want 
to watch the world burn, and bats all over the world are threatened
by damage to the places that we call home, including mangrove swamps, old-growth forests, and, of course, bat caves. So even though I'm the hero of the story,
I do need to be saved. And now that you know 
the true story about us bats, you can learn how to protect 
such heroic animals. Install a properly designed bat box, one of the easiest ways 
to provide shelter for bats. Discourage the use of pesticides,
which can harm bats when we try to feed on the insects 
you want to get rid of in the first place. Avoid going into caves 
where you might disturb hibernating bats, and always decontaminate 
your gear after visiting a cave. If you have unwanted bats 
living in an attic or barn, contact your local government 
to safely and humanely relocate us. And if you come across a bat, 
do not attempt to handle it, but instead, call Animal Control. Batman might want to keep 
his identity secret, but a great way to help real bats
is by continuing to learn about them and spreading the truth 
that they are real heroes, even if their good deeds are often unseen.

to bat populations. For example, in January 2014,
a record heat wave in Australia caused over 100,000 bats 
to die from heat exhaustion. Some people just want 
to watch the world burn, and bats all over the world are threatened
by damage to the places that we call home, including mangrove swamps, old-growth forests, and, of course, bat caves. So even though I'm the hero of the story,
I do need to be saved. And now that you know 
the true story about us bats, you can learn how to protect 
such heroic animals. Install a properly designed bat box, one of the easiest ways 
to provide shelter for bats. Discourage the use of pesticides,
which can harm bats when we try to feed on the insects 
you want to get rid of in the first place. Avoid going into caves 
where you might disturb hibernating bats, and always decontaminate 
your gear after visiting a cave. If you have unwanted bats 
living in an attic or barn, contact your local government 
to safely and humanely relocate us. And if you come across a bat, 
do not attempt to handle it, but instead, call Animal Control. Batman might want to keep 
his identity secret, but a great way to help real bats
is by continuing to learn about them and spreading the truth 
that they are real heroes, even if their good deeds are often unseen.

**Transcript**:
For as far back
as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated 
with death and resurrection. Nearly every religion in the world 
has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters,
the dead keep coming back. But is resurrection really possible? And what is the actual difference between 
a living creature and a dead body, anyway? To understand what death is, 
we need to understand what life is. One ancient theory 
was an idea called vitalism, which claimed 
that living things were unique because they were filled 
with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life. Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence 
was common throughout the world, and still persists 
in the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources 
that can replenish it. Vitalism began to fade 
in the Western world following the Scientific Revolution 
in the 17th century. René Descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially 
no different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul
located in the brain's pineal gland. And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall 
even claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately
before and after death in an attempt to prove it. Though his experiments were discredited,
much like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory 
still come up in popular culture. But where do all these discredited 
theories leave us? What we now know is 
that life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing 
biological processes themselves. And to understand these processes, we need to zoom down 
to the level of our individual cells. Inside each of these cells, chemical reactions 
are constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen
that our bodies convert into the energy-carrying molecule
known as ATP. Cells use this energy
for everything from repair to growth to reproduction. Not only does it take a lot of energy 
to make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more 
to get them where they need to be. The universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend 
towards diffusing randomly, moving from areas 
of high concentration to low concentration, or even breaking apart 
into smaller molecules and atoms. So cells must constantly keep 
entropy in check by using energy to maintain 
their molecules in the very complicated formations necessary for biological functions
to occur. The breaking down of these arrangements 
when the entire cell succumbs to entropy is what eventually results in death. This is the reason organisms 
can't be simply sparked back to life once they've already died. We can pump air into someone's lungs, but it won't do much good if the many other processes
involved in the respiratory cycle are no longer functioning. Similarly, the electric shock
from a defibrillator doesn't jump-start an inanimate heart, but resynchronizes the muscle cells 
in an abnormally beating heart so they regain their normal rhythm. This can prevent a person from dying, 
but it won't raise a dead body, or a monster sewn together 
from dead bodies. So it would seem 
that all our various medical miracles can delay or prevent death
but not reverse it. But that's not as simple as it sounds because constant advancements 
in technology and medicine have resulted in diagnoses such as coma, describing potentially 
reversible conditions, under which people would have previously 
been considered dead. In the future, the point of no return 
may be pushed even further. Some animals are known 
to extend their lifespans or survive extreme conditions by slowing down their biological processes to the point where 
they are virtually paused. And research into cryonics 
hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people 
and reviving them later when newer technology 
is able to help them. See, if the cells are frozen, 
there's very little molecular movement, and diffusion practically stops. Even if all of a person's cellular 
processes had already broken down, this could still conceivably be reversed 
by a swarm of nanobots, moving all the molecules 
back to their proper positions, and injecting all of the cells 
with ATP at the same time, presumably causing the body 
to simply pick up where it left off. So if we think of life 
not as some magical spark, but a state of incredibly complex,
self-perpetuating organization, death is just 
the process of increasing entropy that destroys this fragile balance. And the point at which 
someone is completely dead turns out not to be a fixed constant, but simply a matter 
of how much of this entropy we're currently capable of reversing.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Dead bodies are cold. Would heating them up restore them to life?
Options: A. Yes, because it would restore movement to the molecules inside the body, B. Yes, because bodies need energy, and heat is a form of energy, C. No, this would probably make them rot faster (and smell worse!), D. No, because heat is a waste product and does nothing useful

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to coal, climate change, and energy, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about how a defibrillator works.

However, if I had to choose the least dissimilar one, I would say that Question 6 is the closest, but only because it mentions a technique that involves the use of oxygen, which is vaguely related to the concept of a defibrillator, which uses an electrical pulse to resynchronize heart muscle cells. However, this is a very weak connection, and I would not consider Question 6 to be a good match.

Therefore, I would say that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ, and a new set of generated MCQs would be needed to find a suitable match.

with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life. Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence 
was common throughout the world, and still persists 
in the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources 
that can replenish it. Vitalism began to fade 
in the Western world following the Scientific Revolution 
in the 17th century. René Descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially 
no different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul
located in the brain's pineal gland. And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall 
even claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately
before and after death in an attempt to prove it. Though his experiments were discredited,
much like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory 
still come up in popular culture. But where do all these discredited 
theories leave us? What we now know is 
that life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing 
biological processes themselves. And to understand these processes, we need to zoom down 
to the level of our individual cells. Inside each of these cells, chemical reactions 
are constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen
that our bodies convert into the energy-carrying molecule
known as ATP. Cells use this energy
for everything from repair to growth to reproduction. Not only does it take a lot of energy 
to make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more 
to get them where they need to be. The universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend 
towards diffusing randomly, moving from areas 
of high concentration to low concentration, or even breaking apart 
into smaller molecules and atoms. So cells must constantly keep 
entropy in check by using energy to maintain 
their molecules in the very complicated formations necessary for biological functions
to occur. The breaking down of these arrangements 
when the entire cell succumbs to entropy is what eventually results in death. This is the reason organisms 
can't be simply sparked back to life once they've already died. We can pump air into someone's lungs, but it won't do much good if the many other processes
involved in the respiratory cycle are no longer functioning. Similarly, the electric shock
from a defibrillator doesn't jump-start an inanimate heart, but resynchronizes the muscle cells 
in an abnormally beating heart so they regain their normal rhythm. This can prevent a person from dying, 
but it won't raise a dead body, or a monster sewn together 
from dead bodies. So it would seem 
that all our various medical miracles can delay or prevent death
but not reverse it. But that's not as simple as it sounds because constant advancements 
in technology and medicine have resulted in diagnoses such as coma, describing potentially 
reversible conditions, under which people would have previously 
been considered dead. In the future, the point of no return 
may be pushed even further. Some animals are known 
to extend their lifespans or survive extreme conditions by slowing down their biological processes to the point where 
they are virtually paused. And research into cryonics 
hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people 
and reviving them later when newer technology 
is able to help them. See, if the cells are frozen, 
there's very little molecular movement, and diffusion practically stops. Even if all of a person's cellular 
processes had already broken down, this could still conceivably be reversed 
by a swarm of nanobots, moving all the molecules 
back to their proper positions, and injecting all of the cells 
with ATP at the same time, presumably causing the body 
to simply pick up where it left off. So if we think of life 
not as some magical spark, but a state of incredibly complex,
self-perpetuating organization, death is just 
the process of increasing entropy that destroys this fragile balance. And the point at which 
someone is completely dead turns out not to be a fixed constant, but simply a matter 
of how much of this entropy we're currently capable of reversing.

For as far back
as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated 
with death and resurrection. Nearly every religion in the world 
has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters,
the dead keep coming back. But is resurrection really possible? And what is the actual difference between 
a living creature and a dead body, anyway? To understand what death is, 
we need to understand what life is. One ancient theory 
was an idea called vitalism, which claimed 
that living things were unique because they were filled 
with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life. Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is related to the concept of entropy in living cells, while the generated MCQs are related to coal, climate change, and carbon emissions. There is no overlap in terms of content or intent between the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs.

Therefore, I cannot provide an index of a generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs do not cover the topic of entropy in living cells, and it is not possible to identify a matching question.

If you could provide a new set of generated MCQs that are related to the topic of the transcript (death, resurrection, life, and entropy), I would be happy to help you identify a matching question.

What lights up the screen 
that you're looking at right now? Trace back 
the battery chargers and power cords and you'll end up at an electrical outlet, providing easy, safe access 
to reliable electricity. But beyond that outlet, 
the picture gets messier. It takes a lot of fuel to heat our homes, preserve our food, and our power our gadgets 
around the clock. And for 40% of the world, 
that fuel is cheap, plentiful, and it's called coal. But coal also releases 
pollutants into the air, like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, soot, and toxic metals, like mercury. These cause environmental damage,
like acid rain, and serious health problems. In fact, in 1952, coal burning 
caused such heavy smog in London that pedestrians 
couldn't even see their feet, and thousands of people died
from ill health. Since then, many countries 
have deployed technology to remove most of these pollutants 
before they reach the air. But now we have a new 
air pollution problem on our hands, one that doesn't show up 
in a cloud of dark smog, but in rising seas, floods, and heat waves. It's global climate change, and again, the main culprit is coal. It's responsible for 44%
of global carbon dioxide emissions, which trap the sun's heat 
in the Earth's atmosphere, instead of letting it escape. So now the question is 
how do we remove that bad stuff as well? That's the idea behind cleaner coal. Creating cleaner coal is really about 
trying to contain its ill effects with the help of special technologies
that make the end product more acceptable. Just like the most intriguing superheroes often have their own dark powers 
to overcome, so we can try and keep 
coal's negative forces in check. But why don't we just exterminate coal if it takes that much effort
to clean it up? Simply, coal is extremely valuable to us,
and it's easy to come by. Compressed underground for ages, coal holds chemical energy from plants that were fed from by the sun 
hundreds of millions of years ago, long before humans evolved. That makes coal energy dense, 
meaning it can be burned 'round the clock. It's also cheap, 
if you ignore the pollution costs, and should last us 
through the end of the 21st century. We've already got all the infrastructure 
in place for harnessing its power, and globally, although countries are making a move towards energy from
cleaner and more renewable sources, there's no sign yet 
that coal use is slowing down. In fact, as of 2012, over 1000 new coal plants 
have been proposed, mostly in China and India. Since for the time being 
coal is here to stay, experts say that if we want to reduce 
its emissions' impact on the atmosphere, and slow down climate change, we'll have to think of creative ways 
of reducing coal's destructive power. To do that, we need 
to strip it of its foul forces, all that toxic carbon dioxide 
that causes havoc in the atmosphere. Then, we need to store 
the CO2 somewhere else. This mission is called 
carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. And as if carbon dioxide were some 
evil genie we didn't want to escape, once it has been separated from coal, we've devised ways 
to banish it underground. We can do this by injecting it 
deep into the Earth, or by placing it deep 
under the ocean's surface. Stripping away coal's negative elements
can happen in three ways. First, and most commonly, as coal burns, the exhaust gas can be mixed 
with a compound called monoethanolamine. Like a forceful power-stripping magnet,
this compound bonds to the CO2, yanking it out of the gas stream so it can be stored 
separately underground. Another method is 
to relieve coal of its CO2 before it even has a chance 
to be released as exhaust. In this process, steam and oxygen 
swoop in to the rescue to convert coal into a special 
product called syngas, made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
and some CO2. Zap that with some water vapor, and the carbon monoxide 
gets converted into carbon dioxide, which can be isolated. The leftover hydrogen gas is then
used as energy to generate electricity, so there's an added bonus. A third technique 
exposes coal to pure oxygen, instead of burning it in air. This creates exhaust gas with higher 
concentrations of carbon dioxide, which makes it easy to isolate 
and to banish to the chasms below. All this can reduce emissions 
at a power plant by up to 90%, but as with any superhero 
struggling with their destructive powers, it takes a lot of effort 
to switch over from the dark side. So these positive 
pollution-busting forces, although they're available, have barely been used 
in commercial power plants because they cost a lot. But ultimately, the bigger problem 
is that in most parts of the world, it's still too easy and much cheaper 
to keep emitting carbon dioxide, and that makes it tempting 
to completely ignore coal's dark side. In this case, the most powerful 
force for good is regulation, the rules that can restrict 
the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from power plants, and make energy companies 
around the world wary of what they put into the air. Until then, every time you turn on a screen 
or flick a light switch, coal is lurking in the background, carrying its dark powers with it 
wherever it goes.

of reducing coal's destructive power. To do that, we need 
to strip it of its foul forces, all that toxic carbon dioxide 
that causes havoc in the atmosphere. Then, we need to store 
the CO2 somewhere else. This mission is called 
carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. And as if carbon dioxide were some 
evil genie we didn't want to escape, once it has been separated from coal, we've devised ways 
to banish it underground. We can do this by injecting it 
deep into the Earth, or by placing it deep 
under the ocean's surface. Stripping away coal's negative elements
can happen in three ways. First, and most commonly, as coal burns, the exhaust gas can be mixed 
with a compound called monoethanolamine. Like a forceful power-stripping magnet,
this compound bonds to the CO2, yanking it out of the gas stream so it can be stored 
separately underground. Another method is 
to relieve coal of its CO2 before it even has a chance 
to be released as exhaust. In this process, steam and oxygen 
swoop in to the rescue to convert coal into a special 
product called syngas, made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
and some CO2. Zap that with some water vapor, and the carbon monoxide 
gets converted into carbon dioxide, which can be isolated. The leftover hydrogen gas is then
used as energy to generate electricity, so there's an added bonus. A third technique 
exposes coal to pure oxygen, instead of burning it in air. This creates exhaust gas with higher 
concentrations of carbon dioxide, which makes it easy to isolate 
and to banish to the chasms below. All this can reduce emissions 
at a power plant by up to 90%, but as with any superhero 
struggling with their destructive powers, it takes a lot of effort 
to switch over from the dark side. So these positive 
pollution-busting forces, although they're available, have barely been used 
in commercial power plants because they cost a lot. But ultimately, the bigger problem 
is that in most parts of the world, it's still too easy and much cheaper 
to keep emitting carbon dioxide, and that makes it tempting 
to completely ignore coal's dark side. In this case, the most powerful 
force for good is regulation, the rules that can restrict 
the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from power plants, and make energy companies 
around the world wary of what they put into the air. Until then, every time you turn on a screen 
or flick a light switch, coal is lurking in the background, carrying its dark powers with it 
wherever it goes.

**Transcript**:
What lights up the screen 
that you're looking at right now? Trace back 
the battery chargers and power cords and you'll end up at an electrical outlet, providing easy, safe access 
to reliable electricity. But beyond that outlet, 
the picture gets messier. It takes a lot of fuel to heat our homes, preserve our food, and our power our gadgets 
around the clock. And for 40% of the world, 
that fuel is cheap, plentiful, and it's called coal. But coal also releases 
pollutants into the air, like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, soot, and toxic metals, like mercury. These cause environmental damage,
like acid rain, and serious health problems. In fact, in 1952, coal burning 
caused such heavy smog in London that pedestrians 
couldn't even see their feet, and thousands of people died
from ill health. Since then, many countries 
have deployed technology to remove most of these pollutants 
before they reach the air. But now we have a new 
air pollution problem on our hands, one that doesn't show up 
in a cloud of dark smog, but in rising seas, floods, and heat waves. It's global climate change, and again, the main culprit is coal. It's responsible for 44%
of global carbon dioxide emissions, which trap the sun's heat 
in the Earth's atmosphere, instead of letting it escape. So now the question is 
how do we remove that bad stuff as well? That's the idea behind cleaner coal. Creating cleaner coal is really about 
trying to contain its ill effects with the help of special technologies
that make the end product more acceptable. Just like the most intriguing superheroes often have their own dark powers 
to overcome, so we can try and keep 
coal's negative forces in check. But why don't we just exterminate coal if it takes that much effort
to clean it up? Simply, coal is extremely valuable to us,
and it's easy to come by. Compressed underground for ages, coal holds chemical energy from plants that were fed from by the sun 
hundreds of millions of years ago, long before humans evolved. That makes coal energy dense, 
meaning it can be burned 'round the clock. It's also cheap, 
if you ignore the pollution costs, and should last us 
through the end of the 21st century. We've already got all the infrastructure 
in place for harnessing its power, and globally, although countries are making a move towards energy from
cleaner and more renewable sources, there's no sign yet 
that coal use is slowing down. In fact, as of 2012, over 1000 new coal plants 
have been proposed, mostly in China and India. Since for the time being 
coal is here to stay, experts say that if we want to reduce 
its emissions' impact on the atmosphere, and slow down climate change, we'll have to think of creative ways 
of reducing coal's destructive power. To do that, we need 
to strip it of its foul forces, all that toxic carbon dioxide 
that causes havoc in the atmosphere. Then, we need to store 
the CO2 somewhere else. This mission is called 
carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. And as if carbon dioxide were some 
evil genie we didn't want to escape, once it has been separated from coal, we've devised ways 
to banish it underground. We can do this by injecting it 
deep into the Earth, or by placing it deep 
under the ocean's surface. Stripping away coal's negative elements
can happen in three ways. First, and most commonly, as coal burns, the exhaust gas can be mixed 
with a compound called monoethanolamine. Like a forceful power-stripping magnet,
this compound bonds to the CO2, yanking it out of the gas stream so it can be stored 
separately underground. Another method is 
to relieve coal of its CO2 before it even has a chance 
to be released as exhaust. In this process, steam and oxygen 
swoop in to the rescue to convert coal into a special 
product called syngas, made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
and some CO2. Zap that with some water vapor, and the carbon monoxide 
gets converted into carbon dioxide, which can be isolated. The leftover hydrogen gas is then
used as energy to generate electricity, so there's an added bonus. A third technique

**Transcript**:
What lights up the screen 
that you're looking at right now? Trace back 
the battery chargers and power cords and you'll end up at an electrical outlet, providing easy, safe access 
to reliable electricity. But beyond that outlet, 
the picture gets messier. It takes a lot of fuel to heat our homes, preserve our food, and our power our gadgets 
around the clock. And for 40% of the world, 
that fuel is cheap, plentiful, and it's called coal. But coal also releases 
pollutants into the air, like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, soot, and toxic metals, like mercury. These cause environmental damage,
like acid rain, and serious health problems. In fact, in 1952, coal burning 
caused such heavy smog in London that pedestrians 
couldn't even see their feet, and thousands of people died
from ill health. Since then, many countries 
have deployed technology to remove most of these pollutants 
before they reach the air. But now we have a new 
air pollution problem on our hands, one that doesn't show up 
in a cloud of dark smog, but in rising seas, floods, and heat waves. It's global climate change, and again, the main culprit is coal. It's responsible for 44%
of global carbon dioxide emissions, which trap the sun's heat 
in the Earth's atmosphere, instead of letting it escape. So now the question is 
how do we remove that bad stuff as well? That's the idea behind cleaner coal. Creating cleaner coal is really about 
trying to contain its ill effects with the help of special technologies
that make the end product more acceptable. Just like the most intriguing superheroes often have their own dark powers 
to overcome, so we can try and keep 
coal's negative forces in check. But why don't we just exterminate coal if it takes that much effort
to clean it up? Simply, coal is extremely valuable to us,
and it's easy to come by. Compressed underground for ages, coal holds chemical energy from plants that were fed from by the sun 
hundreds of millions of years ago, long before humans evolved. That makes coal energy dense, 
meaning it can be burned 'round the clock. It's also cheap, 
if you ignore the pollution costs, and should last us 
through the end of the 21st century. We've already got all the infrastructure 
in place for harnessing its power, and globally, although countries are making a move towards energy from
cleaner and more renewable sources, there's no sign yet 
that coal use is slowing down. In fact, as of 2012, over 1000 new coal plants 
have been proposed, mostly in China and India. Since for the time being 
coal is here to stay, experts say that if we want to reduce 
its emissions' impact on the atmosphere, and slow down climate change, we'll have to think of creative ways 
of reducing coal's destructive power. To do that, we need 
to strip it of its foul forces, all that toxic carbon dioxide 
that causes havoc in the atmosphere. Then, we need to store 
the CO2 somewhere else. This mission is called 
carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. And as if carbon dioxide were some 
evil genie we didn't want to escape, once it has been separated from coal, we've devised ways 
to banish it underground. We can do this by injecting it 
deep into the Earth, or by placing it deep 
under the ocean's surface. Stripping away coal's negative elements
can happen in three ways. First, and most commonly, as coal burns, the exhaust gas can be mixed 
with a compound called monoethanolamine. Like a forceful power-stripping magnet,
this compound bonds to the CO2, yanking it out of the gas stream so it can be stored 
separately underground. Another method is 
to relieve coal of its CO2 before it even has a chance 
to be released as exhaust. In this process, steam and oxygen 
swoop in to the rescue to convert coal into a special 
product called syngas, made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
and some CO2. Zap that with some water vapor, and the carbon monoxide 
gets converted into carbon dioxide, which can be isolated. The leftover hydrogen gas is then
used as energy to generate electricity, so there's an added bonus. A third technique 
exposes coal to pure oxygen, instead of burning it in air. This creates exhaust gas with higher 
concentrations of carbon dioxide, which makes it easy to isolate 
and to banish to the chasms below. All this can reduce emissions 
at a power plant by up to 90%, but as with any superhero 
struggling with their destructive powers, it takes a lot of effort 
to switch over from the dark side. So these positive 
pollution-busting forces, although they're available, have barely been used 
in commercial power plants because they cost a lot. But ultimately, the bigger problem 
is that in most parts of the world, it's still too easy and much cheaper 
to keep emitting carbon dioxide, and that makes it tempting 
to completely ignore coal's dark side. In this case, the most powerful 
force for good is regulation, the rules that can restrict 
the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from power plants, and make energy companies 
around the world wary of what they put into the air. Until then, every time you turn on a screen 
or flick a light switch, coal is lurking in the background, carrying its dark powers with it 
wherever it goes.

**Transcript**:
What do an ancient Greek philosopher and a 19th century Quaker have in common 
with Nobel Prize-winning scientists? Although they are separated 
over 2,400 years of history, each of them contributed 
to answering the eternal question: what is stuff made of? It was around 440 BCE 
that Democritus first proposed that everything in the world 
was made up of tiny particles surrounded by empty space. And he even speculated 
that they vary in size and shape depending on the substance they compose. He called these particles "atomos,"
Greek for indivisible. His ideas were opposed by
the more popular philosophers of his day. Aristotle, for instance, disagreed completely, stating instead that matter 
was made of four elements: earth, wind, water and fire, and most later scientists followed suit. Atoms would remain 
all but forgotten until 1808, when a Quaker teacher named John Dalton 
sought to challenge Aristotelian theory. Whereas Democritus's atomism
had been purely theoretical, Dalton showed that common substances
always broke down into the same elements in the same proportions. He concluded that the various compounds were combinations of atoms 
of different elements, each of a particular size and mass that could neither be created 
nor destroyed. Though he received 
many honors for his work, as a Quaker, Dalton lived modestly 
until the end of his days. Atomic theory was now accepted 
by the scientific community, but the next major advancement would not come 
until nearly a century later with the physicist J.J. Thompson's 
1897 discovery of the electron. In what we might call 
the chocolate chip cookie model of the atom, he showed atoms as 
uniformly packed spheres of positive matter filled with negatively charged electrons. Thompson won a Nobel Prize in 1906 
for his electron discovery, but his model of the atom 
didn't stick around long. This was because he happened 
to have some pretty smart students, including a certain Ernest Rutherford, who would become known 
as the father of the nuclear age. While studying the effects 
of X-rays on gases, Rutherford decided 
to investigate atoms more closely by shooting small, positively charged 
alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil. Under Thompson's model, the atom's thinly dispersed 
positive charge would not be enough 
to deflect the particles in any one place. The effect would have been 
like a bunch of tennis balls punching through a thin paper screen. But while most of the particles 
did pass through, some bounced right back, suggesting that the foil was more 
like a thick net with a very large mesh. Rutherford concluded that atoms 
consisted largely of empty space with just a few electrons, while most of the mass 
was concentrated in the center, which he termed the nucleus. The alpha particles 
passed through the gaps but bounced back from the dense, 
positively charged nucleus. But the atomic theory 
wasn't complete just yet. In 1913, another of Thompson's students 
by the name of Niels Bohr expanded on Rutherford's nuclear model. Drawing on earlier work 
by Max Planck and Albert Einstein he stipulated that electrons 
orbit the nucleus at fixed energies and distances, able to jump from one level to another,
but not to exist in the space between. Bohr's planetary model took center stage, but soon, it too encountered 
some complications. Experiments had shown that rather than 
simply being discrete particles, electrons simultaneously 
behaved like waves, not being confined 
to a particular point in space. And in formulating 
his famous uncertainty principle, Werner Heisenberg showed 
it was impossible to determine both the exact 
position and speed of electrons as they moved around an atom. The idea that electrons 
cannot be pinpointed but exist within 
a range of possible locations gave rise to the current 
quantum model of the atom, a fascinating theory 
with a whole new set of complexities whose implications 
have yet to be fully grasped. Even though our understanding 
of atoms keeps changing, the basic fact of atoms remains, so let's celebrate 
the triumph of atomic theory with some fireworks. As electrons circling an atom 
shift between energy levels, they absorb or release energy in the form
of specific wavelengths of light, resulting in 
all the marvelous colors we see. And we can imagine Democritus 
watching from somewhere, satisfied that over two millennia later, he turned out 
to have been right all along.

**Transcript**:
What do an ancient Greek philosopher and a 19th century Quaker have in common 
with Nobel Prize-winning scientists? Although they are separated 
over 2,400 years of history, each of them contributed 
to answering the eternal question: what is stuff made of? It was around 440 BCE 
that Democritus first proposed that everything in the world 
was made up of tiny particles surrounded by empty space. And he even speculated 
that they vary in size and shape depending on the substance they compose. He called these particles "atomos,"
Greek for indivisible. His ideas were opposed by
the more popular philosophers of his day. Aristotle, for instance, disagreed completely, stating instead that matter 
was made of four elements: earth, wind, water and fire, and most later scientists followed suit. Atoms would remain 
all but forgotten until 1808, when a Quaker teacher named John Dalton 
sought to challenge Aristotelian theory. Whereas Democritus's atomism
had been purely theoretical, Dalton showed that common substances
always broke down into the same elements in the same proportions. He concluded that the various compounds were combinations of atoms 
of different elements, each of a particular size and mass that could neither be created 
nor destroyed. Though he received 
many honors for his work, as a Quaker, Dalton lived modestly 
until the end of his days. Atomic theory was now accepted 
by the scientific community, but the next major advancement would not come 
until nearly a century later with the physicist J.J. Thompson's 
1897 discovery of the electron. In what we might call 
the chocolate chip cookie model of the atom, he showed atoms as 
uniformly packed spheres of positive matter filled with negatively charged electrons. Thompson won a Nobel Prize in 1906 
for his electron discovery, but his model of the atom 
didn't stick around long. This was because he happened 
to have some pretty smart students, including a certain Ernest Rutherford, who would become known 
as the father of the nuclear age. While studying the effects 
of X-rays on gases, Rutherford decided 
to investigate atoms more closely by shooting small, positively charged 
alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil. Under Thompson's model, the atom's thinly dispersed 
positive charge would not be enough 
to deflect the particles in any one place. The effect would have been 
like a bunch of tennis balls punching through a thin paper screen. But while most of the particles 
did pass through, some bounced right back, suggesting that the foil was more 
like a thick net with a very large mesh. Rutherford concluded that atoms 
consisted largely of empty space with just a few electrons, while most of the mass 
was concentrated in the center, which he termed the nucleus. The alpha particles 
passed through the gaps but bounced back from the dense, 
positively charged nucleus. But the atomic theory 
wasn't complete just yet. In 1913, another of Thompson's students 
by the name of Niels Bohr expanded on Rutherford's nuclear model. Drawing on earlier work 
by Max Planck and Albert Einstein he stipulated that electrons 
orbit the nucleus at fixed energies and distances, able to jump from one level to another,
but not to exist in the space between. Bohr's planetary model took center stage, but soon, it too encountered 
some complications. Experiments had shown that rather than 
simply being discrete particles, electrons simultaneously 
behaved like waves, not being confined 
to a particular point in space. And in formulating 
his famous uncertainty principle, Werner Heisenberg showed 
it was impossible to determine both the exact 
position and speed of electrons as they moved around an atom. The idea that electrons 
cannot be pinpointed but exist within 
a range of possible locations gave rise to the current 
quantum model of the atom, a fascinating theory 
with a whole new set of complexities whose implications 
have yet to be fully grasped. Even though our understanding 
of atoms keeps changing, the basic fact of atoms remains, so let's celebrate 
the triumph of atomic theory with some fireworks. As electrons circling an atom 
shift between energy levels, they absorb or release energy in the form
of specific wavelengths of light, resulting in 
all the marvelous colors we see. And we can imagine Democritus 
watching from somewhere, satisfied that over two millennia later, he turned out 
to have been right all along.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1976, a mysterious epidemic
suddenly struck two central African towns, killing the majority of its victims. Medical researchers suspected the deadly Marburg virus 
to be the culprit. But what they saw in microscope images
was an entirely new pathogen, which would be named
after the nearby Ebola river. Like yellow fever or dengue, the disease caused by the Ebola virus
is a severe type of hemorrhagic fever. It begins by attacking 
the immune system's cells and neutralizing its responses, allowing the virus to proliferate. Starting anywhere from two to twenty days
after contraction, initial symptoms like high temperature, aching, and sore throat resemble those of a typical flu, but quickly escalate to vomiting, rashes, and diarrhea. And as the virus spreads, it invades the lymph nodes 
and vital organs, such as kidneys and liver,
causing them to lose function. But the virus itself 
is not what kills Ebola victims. Instead, the mounting cell deaths 
trigger an immune system overload, known as a cytokine storm, an explosion of immune responses
that damages blood vessels, causing both internal and external bleeding. The excessive fluid loss 
and resulting complications can be fatal within six to sixteen days
of the first symptoms, though proper care and rehydration therapy can significantly reduce 
mortality rates in patients. Fortunately, 
while Ebola is highly virulent, several factors limit its contagiousness. Unlike viruses that proliferate through
small, airborne particles, Ebola only exists in bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, mucus, vomit, or feces. In order to spread, these must be transmitted from 
an infected person into another's body through passageways such as the eyes,
mouth, or nose. And because the disease's severity increases directly along 
with the viral load, even an infected person 
is unlikely to be contagious until they have begun to show symptoms. While Ebola has been shown 
to survive on surfaces for several hours, and transmission through sneezing
or coughing is theoretically possible, virtually all known cases of contraction
have been through direct contact with the severely ill, with the greatest risk 
posed to medical workers and friends or relatives of the victims. This is why,
despite its horrifying effects, Ebola has been far less deadly overall
than more common infections, such as measles, malaria, or even influenza. Once an outbreak has been contained, the virus does not exist 
in the human population until the next outbreak begins. But while this is undoubtedly a good thing, it also makes Ebola difficult to study. Scientists believe fruit bats 
to be its natural carriers, but just how it is transmitted to humans
remains unknown. Furthermore, many of the countries 
where Ebola outbreaks occur suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation, which enables the disease to spread. And the poverty of these regions, combined with the relatively low amount
of overall cases means there is little economic incentive
for drug companies to invest in research. Though some experimental medicines
have shown promise, and governments are funding development
of a vaccine, as of 2014, the only widespread and effective 
solutions to an Ebola outbreak remain isolation, sanitation, and information.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1976, a mysterious epidemic
suddenly struck two central African towns, killing the majority of its victims. Medical researchers suspected the deadly Marburg virus 
to be the culprit. But what they saw in microscope images
was an entirely new pathogen, which would be named
after the nearby Ebola river. Like yellow fever or dengue, the disease caused by the Ebola virus
is a severe type of hemorrhagic fever. It begins by attacking 
the immune system's cells and neutralizing its responses, allowing the virus to proliferate. Starting anywhere from two to twenty days
after contraction, initial symptoms like high temperature, aching, and sore throat resemble those of a typical flu, but quickly escalate to vomiting, rashes, and diarrhea. And as the virus spreads, it invades the lymph nodes 
and vital organs, such as kidneys and liver,
causing them to lose function. But the virus itself 
is not what kills Ebola victims. Instead, the mounting cell deaths 
trigger an immune system overload, known as a cytokine storm, an explosion of immune responses
that damages blood vessels, causing both internal and external bleeding. The excessive fluid loss 
and resulting complications can be fatal within six to sixteen days
of the first symptoms, though proper care and rehydration therapy can significantly reduce 
mortality rates in patients. Fortunately, 
while Ebola is highly virulent, several factors limit its contagiousness. Unlike viruses that proliferate through
small, airborne particles, Ebola only exists in bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, mucus, vomit, or feces. In order to spread, these must be transmitted from 
an infected person into another's body through passageways such as the eyes,
mouth, or nose. And because the disease's severity increases directly along 
with the viral load, even an infected person 
is unlikely to be contagious until they have begun to show symptoms. While Ebola has been shown 
to survive on surfaces for several hours, and transmission through sneezing
or coughing is theoretically possible, virtually all known cases of contraction
have been through direct contact with the severely ill, with the greatest risk 
posed to medical workers and friends or relatives of the victims. This is why,
despite its horrifying effects, Ebola has been far less deadly overall
than more common infections, such as measles, malaria, or even influenza. Once an outbreak has been contained, the virus does not exist 
in the human population until the next outbreak begins. But while this is undoubtedly a good thing, it also makes Ebola difficult to study. Scientists believe fruit bats 
to be its natural carriers, but just how it is transmitted to humans
remains unknown. Furthermore, many of the countries 
where Ebola outbreaks occur suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation, which enables the disease to spread. And the poverty of these regions, combined with the relatively low amount
of overall cases means there is little economic incentive
for drug companies to invest in research. Though some experimental medicines
have shown promise, and governments are funding development
of a vaccine, as of 2014, the only widespread and effective 
solutions to an Ebola outbreak remain isolation, sanitation, and information.

When you think of natural history museums, you probably picture exhibits 
filled with ancient lifeless things, like dinosaurs meteroites, and gemstones. But behind that educational exterior, which only includes 
about 1% of a museum's collection, there are hidden laboratories 
where scientific breakthroughs are made. Beyond the unmarked doors, and on the floors 
the elevators won't take you to, you'd find windows into amazing worlds. This maze of halls and laboratories 
is a scientific sanctuary that houses a seemingly 
endless variety of specimens. Here, researchers work to unravel 
mysteries of evolution, cosmic origins, and the history of our planet. One museum alone 
may have millions of specimens. The American Museum of Natural History
in New York City has over 32,000,000 in its collection. Let's take a look at just one of them. Scientists have logged exactly
where and when it was found and used various dating techniques 
to pinpoint when it originated. Repeat that a million times over,
and these plants, animals, minerals, fossils, and artifacts present windows 
into times and places around the world and across billions of years of history. When a research problem emerges, scientists peer through these windows
and test hypotheses about the past. For example, in the 1950s, 
populations of predatory birds, like peregrine falcons, owls, and eagles started to mysteriously crash, to the point where a number of species,
including the bald eagle, were declared endangered. Fortunately, scientists in 
The Field Museum in Chicago had been collecting the eggs 
of these predatory birds for decades. They discovered that the egg shells 
used to be thicker and had started to thin around the time when an insecticide called DDT 
started being sprayed on crops. DDT worked very well to kill insects, but when birds came and ate
those heaps of dead bugs, the DDT accumulated in their bodies. It worked its way up the food chain and was absorbed by apex predator birds
in such high concentrations that it thinned their eggs so that they couldn't support 
the nesting bird's weight. There were omelettes everywhere until scientists from 
The Field Museum in Chicago, and other institutions, helped solve the mystery and save the day. America thanks you, Field Museum. Natural history museums 
windows into the past have solved many other 
scientific mysteries. Museum scientists have used 
their collections to sequence the Neanderthal genome, discover genes that gave mammoths red fur, and even pinpoint where 
ancient giant sharks gave birth. There are about 900 
natural history museums in the world, and every year they make 
new discoveries and insights into the Earth's past, present and future. Museum collections even help us 
understand how modern threats, such as global climate change, are impacting our world. For instance, 
naturalists have been collecting samples for over 100 years from Walden Pond, famously immortalized 
by Henry David Thoreau. Thanks to those naturalists,
who count Thoreau among their number, we know that the plants around Walden Pond are blooming over three weeks earlier 
than they did 150 years ago. Because these changes 
have taken place gradually, one person may not have noticed them
over the span of a few decades, but thanks to museum collections, we have an uninterrupted record 
showing how our world is changing. So the next time you're exploring 
a natural history museum, remember that what you're seeing 
is just one gem of a colossal scientific treasure trove. Behind those walls and under your feet
are windows into forgotten worlds. And who knows? One day some future scientist may 
peer through one and see you.

about 1% of a museum's collection, there are hidden laboratories 
where scientific breakthroughs are made. Beyond the unmarked doors, and on the floors 
the elevators won't take you to, you'd find windows into amazing worlds. This maze of halls and laboratories 
is a scientific sanctuary that houses a seemingly 
endless variety of specimens. Here, researchers work to unravel 
mysteries of evolution, cosmic origins, and the history of our planet. One museum alone 
may have millions of specimens. The American Museum of Natural History
in New York City has over 32,000,000 in its collection. Let's take a look at just one of them. Scientists have logged exactly
where and when it was found and used various dating techniques 
to pinpoint when it originated. Repeat that a million times over,
and these plants, animals, minerals, fossils, and artifacts present windows 
into times and places around the world and across billions of years of history. When a research problem emerges, scientists peer through these windows
and test hypotheses about the past. For example, in the 1950s, 
populations of predatory birds, like peregrine falcons, owls, and eagles started to mysteriously crash, to the point where a number of species,
including the bald eagle, were declared endangered. Fortunately, scientists in 
The Field Museum in Chicago had been collecting the eggs 
of these predatory birds for decades. They discovered that the egg shells 
used to be thicker and had started to thin around the time when an insecticide called DDT 
started being sprayed on crops. DDT worked very well to kill insects, but when birds came and ate
those heaps of dead bugs, the DDT accumulated in their bodies. It worked its way up the food chain and was absorbed by apex predator birds
in such high concentrations that it thinned their eggs so that they couldn't support 
the nesting bird's weight. There were omelettes everywhere until scientists from 
The Field Museum in Chicago, and other institutions, helped solve the mystery and save the day. America thanks you, Field Museum. Natural history museums 
windows into the past have solved many other 
scientific mysteries. Museum scientists have used 
their collections to sequence the Neanderthal genome, discover genes that gave mammoths red fur, and even pinpoint where 
ancient giant sharks gave birth. There are about 900 
natural history museums in the world, and every year they make 
new discoveries and insights into the Earth's past, present and future. Museum collections even help us 
understand how modern threats, such as global climate change, are impacting our world. For instance, 
naturalists have been collecting samples for over 100 years from Walden Pond, famously immortalized 
by Henry David Thoreau. Thanks to those naturalists,
who count Thoreau among their number, we know that the plants around Walden Pond are blooming over three weeks earlier 
than they did 150 years ago. Because these changes 
have taken place gradually, one person may not have noticed them
over the span of a few decades, but thanks to museum collections, we have an uninterrupted record 
showing how our world is changing. So the next time you're exploring 
a natural history museum, remember that what you're seeing 
is just one gem of a colossal scientific treasure trove. Behind those walls and under your feet
are windows into forgotten worlds. And who knows? One day some future scientist may 
peer through one and see you.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed something swimming
in your field of vision? It may look like a tiny worm
or a transparent blob, and whenever you try to get
a closer look, it disappears, only to reappear
as soon as you shift your glance. But don't go rinsing out your eyes! What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as a floater. The scientific name for these objects
is Muscae volitantes, Latin for "flying flies," and true to their name,
they can be somewhat annoying. But they're not actually bugs
or any kind of external objects at all. Rather, they exist inside your eyeball. Floaters may seem to be alive,
since they move and change shape, but they are not alive. Floaters are tiny objects
that cast shadows on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue
at the back of your eye. They might be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein. And because they're suspended
within the vitreous humor, the gel-like liquid
that fills the inside of your eye, floaters drift along
with your eye movements, and seem to bounce a little
when your eye stops. Floaters may be only
barely distinguishable most of the time. They become more visible
the closer they are to the retina, just as holding your hand closer
to a table with an overhead light will result in a more
sharply defined shadow. And floaters are particularly noticeable when you are looking
at a uniform bright surface, like a blank computer screen, snow, or a clear sky, where the consistency of the background
makes them easier to distinguish. The brighter the light is,
the more your pupil contracts. This has an effect similar
to replacing a large diffuse light fixture with a single overhead light bulb, which also makes
the shadow appear clearer. There is another visual phenomenon
that looks similar to floaters but is in fact unrelated. If you've seen tiny dots of light
darting about when looking at a bright blue sky, you've experienced what is known
as the blue field entoptic phenomenon. In some ways,
this is the opposite of seeing floaters. Here, you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows
letting light through to your retina. The windows are actually caused
by white blood cells moving through the capillaries
along your retina's surface. These leukocytes can be so large
that they nearly fill a capillary causing a plasma space
to open up in front of them. Because the space
and the white blood cells are both more transparent to blue light than the red blood cells
normally present in capillaries, we see a moving dot of light
wherever this happens, following the paths of your capillaries
and moving in time with your pulse. Under ideal viewing conditions, you might even see what looks
like a dark tail following the dot. This is the red blood cells
that have bunched up behind the leukocyte. Some science museums have an exhibit
which consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites
much more clearly than you normally would. While everybody's eyes experience
these sort of effects, the number and type vary greatly. In the case of floaters, they often go unnoticed,
as our brain learns to ignore them. However, abnormally numerous or large floaters
that interfere with vision may be a sign of a more serious condition,
requiring immediate medical treatment. But the majority of the time
entoptic phenomena, such as floaters and blue sky sprites, are just a gentle reminder
that what we think we see depends just as much
on our biology and minds as it does on the external world.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to the liver and its functions, while the ground truth MCQ is related to the movement of white blood cells in the eyes.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and style of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Here's an example of a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ:

Question: Why can you see the movement of white blood cells in your eyes?
Options: A. Because white blood cells are like little amoebas and can move on their own, B. Because white blood cells float around casting shadows on the retina, C. Because white blood cells let more light through to the retina than red blood cells, D. Because white blood cells are in the vitreous humor

Correct Option: C

This new generated MCQ matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

Again, I apologize for not being able to find a match among the original generated MCQs.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed something swimming
in your field of vision? It may look like a tiny worm
or a transparent blob, and whenever you try to get
a closer look, it disappears, only to reappear
as soon as you shift your glance. But don't go rinsing out your eyes! What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as a floater. The scientific name for these objects
is Muscae volitantes, Latin for "flying flies," and true to their name,
they can be somewhat annoying. But they're not actually bugs
or any kind of external objects at all. Rather, they exist inside your eyeball. Floaters may seem to be alive,
since they move and change shape, but they are not alive. Floaters are tiny objects
that cast shadows on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue
at the back of your eye. They might be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein. And because they're suspended
within the vitreous humor, the gel-like liquid
that fills the inside of your eye, floaters drift along
with your eye movements, and seem to bounce a little
when your eye stops. Floaters may be only
barely distinguishable most of the time. They become more visible
the closer they are to the retina, just as holding your hand closer
to a table with an overhead light will result in a more
sharply defined shadow. And floaters are particularly noticeable when you are looking
at a uniform bright surface, like a blank computer screen, snow, or a clear sky, where the consistency of the background
makes them easier to distinguish. The brighter the light is,
the more your pupil contracts. This has an effect similar
to replacing a large diffuse light fixture with a single overhead light bulb, which also makes
the shadow appear clearer. There is another visual phenomenon
that looks similar to floaters but is in fact unrelated. If you've seen tiny dots of light
darting about when looking at a bright blue sky, you've experienced what is known
as the blue field entoptic phenomenon. In some ways,
this is the opposite of seeing floaters. Here, you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows
letting light through to your retina. The windows are actually caused
by white blood cells moving through the capillaries
along your retina's surface. These leukocytes can be so large
that they nearly fill a capillary causing a plasma space
to open up in front of them. Because the space
and the white blood cells are both more transparent to blue light than the red blood cells
normally present in capillaries, we see a moving dot of light
wherever this happens, following the paths of your capillaries
and moving in time with your pulse. Under ideal viewing conditions, you might even see what looks
like a dark tail following the dot. This is the red blood cells
that have bunched up behind the leukocyte. Some science museums have an exhibit
which consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites
much more clearly than you normally would. While everybody's eyes experience
these sort of effects, the number and type vary greatly. In the case of floaters, they often go unnoticed,
as our brain learns to ignore them. However, abnormally numerous or large floaters
that interfere with vision may be a sign of a more serious condition,
requiring immediate medical treatment. But the majority of the time
entoptic phenomena, such as floaters and blue sky sprites, are just a gentle reminder
that what we think we see depends just as much
on our biology and minds as it does on the external world.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why can you see floaters more easily when your pupil contracts?

**Transcript**:
There's a factory inside you 
that weighs about 1.4 kilograms and runs for 24 hours a day. This is your liver,
the heaviest organ in your body, and one of the most crucial. This industrious structure 
simultaneously acts as a storehouse, a manufacturing hub, and a processing plant. And each of these functions involve 
so many important subtasks that without the liver, 
our bodies would simply stop working. One of the liver's main functions 
is to filter the body's blood, which it receives in regular shipments 
from two sources: the hepatic artery 
delivers blood from the heart, while the hepatic portal vein 
brings it from the intestine. This double delivery 
fills the liver with nutrients, that it then sorts, processes and stores with the help of thousands 
of tiny internal processing plants, known as lobules. Both blood flows also deliver the oxygen 
that the liver needs to function. The blood that is received 
from the intestine contains carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins and other nutrients 
dissolved in it from the food you've consumed. These must be processed in different ways. In the case of carbohydrates, the liver breaks them down 
and converts them into sugars for the body to use as energy 
when the filtered blood is sent back out. Sometimes the body 
has leftovers of nutrients that it doesn't immediately require. When that happens, 
the liver holds some back, and stacks them in its storage facility. This facility works like a pantry for future cases when the body 
might be in need of nutrients. But the blood flowing into the liver
isn't always full of good things. It also contains toxins
and byproducts that the body can't use. And the liver monitors these strictly. When it spots
a useless or toxic substance, it either converts it into a product 
that can't hurt the body or isolates it and whisks it away, channeling it through 
the kidneys and intestine to be excreted. Of course, we wouldn't consider 
the liver a factory if it didn't also manufacture things. This organ makes everything 
from various blood plasma proteins that transport fatty acids 
and help form blood clots, to the cholesterol 
that helps the body create hormones. It also makes vitamin D
and substances that help digestion. But one of its most vital products 
is bile. Like an eco-friendly treatment plant, the liver uses cells called hepatocytes to convert toxic waste products 
into this bitter greenish liquid. As it's produced, bile is funneled 
into a small container below the liver, called the gallbladder, before being trickled into the intestine to help break down fats, destroy microbes,
and neutralize extra stomach acid. Bile also helps carry other toxins 
and byproducts from the liver out of the body. So as you can see, the liver is an extremely efficient 
industrial site, performing multiple tasks 
that support each other. But such a complex system 
needs to be kept running smoothly by keeping it healthy and not overloading it 
with more toxins than it can handle. This is one factory 
we simply can't afford to shut down.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as asteroids and space exploration, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the liver and its functions.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that Question 1 is the closest match. But please note that the content and intent of Question 1 are completely different from the ground truth MCQ.

A more accurate approach would be to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of the liver and its functions, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

In this case, I would recommend generating new MCQs that are relevant to the topic, rather than trying to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the existing generated MCQs.

If you would like, I can try to generate new MCQs that are specifically related to the topic of the liver and its functions, and then try to match the ground truth MCQ with one of the new generated MCQs.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 22, Question 2
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
There's a factory inside you 
that weighs about 1.4 kilograms and runs for 24 hours a day. This is your liver,
the heaviest organ in your body, and one of the most crucial. This industrious structure 
simultaneously acts as a storehouse, a manufacturing hub, and a processing plant. And each of these functions involve 
so many important subtasks that without the liver, 
our bodies would simply stop working. One of the liver's main functions 
is to filter the body's blood, which it receives in regular shipments 
from two sources: the hepatic artery 
delivers blood from the heart, while the hepatic portal vein 
brings it from the intestine. This double delivery 
fills the liver with nutrients, that it then sorts, processes and stores with the help of thousands 
of tiny internal processing plants, known as lobules. Both blood flows also deliver the oxygen 
that the liver needs to function. The blood that is received 
from the intestine contains carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins and other nutrients 
dissolved in it from the food you've consumed. These must be processed in different ways. In the case of carbohydrates, the liver breaks them down 
and converts them into sugars for the body to use as energy 
when the filtered blood is sent back out. Sometimes the body 
has leftovers of nutrients that it doesn't immediately require. When that happens, 
the liver holds some back, and stacks them in its storage facility. This facility works like a pantry for future cases when the body 
might be in need of nutrients. But the blood flowing into the liver
isn't always full of good things. It also contains toxins
and byproducts that the body can't use. And the liver monitors these strictly. When it spots
a useless or toxic substance, it either converts it into a product 
that can't hurt the body or isolates it and whisks it away, channeling it through 
the kidneys and intestine to be excreted. Of course, we wouldn't consider 
the liver a factory if it didn't also manufacture things. This organ makes everything 
from various blood plasma proteins that transport fatty acids 
and help form blood clots, to the cholesterol 
that helps the body create hormones. It also makes vitamin D
and substances that help digestion. But one of its most vital products 
is bile. Like an eco-friendly treatment plant, the liver uses cells called hepatocytes to convert toxic waste products 
into this bitter greenish liquid. As it's produced, bile is funneled 
into a small container below the liver, called the gallbladder, before being trickled into the intestine to help break down fats, destroy microbes,
and neutralize extra stomach acid. Bile also helps carry other toxins 
and byproducts from the liver out of the body. So as you can see, the liver is an extremely efficient 
industrial site, performing multiple tasks 
that support each other. But such a complex system 
needs to be kept running smoothly by keeping it healthy and not overloading it 
with more toxins than it can handle. This is one factory 
we simply can't afford to shut down.

**Transcript**:
"Hi, Bob." "Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great." Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells,
that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose. As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell 
separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction 
of the smell's source so that within the first 
few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not
just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue 
divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing 
and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up

wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads

dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot. And everything in the street,
every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much 
more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various 
emotional states, and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby, and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something
at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish. In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness
to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us 
to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences 
the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes.

**Transcript**:
"Hi, Bob." "Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great." Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells,
that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose. As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell 
separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction 
of the smell's source so that within the first 
few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not
just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue 
divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing 
and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot. And everything in the street,
every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much

**Transcript**:
"Hi, Bob." "Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great." Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells,
that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose. As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell 
separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction 
of the smell's source so that within the first 
few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not
just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue 
divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing 
and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot. And everything in the street,
every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much 
more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various 
emotional states, and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby, and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something
at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish. In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness
to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us 
to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences 
the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes.

**Transcript**:
How does your smartphone
know exactly where you are? The answer lies 12,000 miles 
over your head in an orbiting satellite that keeps time
to the beat of an atomic clock powered by quantum mechanics. Phew. Let's break that down. First of all, why is it so important 
to know what time it is on a satellite when location is what
we're concerned about? The first thing 
your phone needs to determine is how far it is from a satellite. Each satellite constantly 
broadcasts radio signals that travel from space to your phone
at the speed of light. Your phone records 
the signal arrival time and uses it to calculate 
the distance to the satellite using the simple formula,
distance = c x time, where c is the speed of light
and time is how long the signal traveled. But there's a problem. Light is incredibly fast. If we were only able to calculate 
time to the nearest second, every location on Earth, and far beyond, would seem to be the same 
distance from the satellite. So in order to calculate that distance
to within a few dozen feet, we need the best clock ever invented. Enter atomic clocks,
some of which are so precise that they would not gain or lose a second even if they ran 
for the next 300 million years. Atomic clocks work 
because of quantum physics. All clocks must have a constant frequency. In other words, a clock must carry out
some repetitive action to mark off equivalent increments of time. Just as a grandfather clock 
relies on the constant swinging back and forth of a pendulum 
under gravity, the tick tock of an atomic clock is maintained by the transition 
between two energy levels of an atom. This is where quantum physics 
comes into play. Quantum mechanics 
says that atoms carry energy, but they can't take on 
just any arbitrary amount. Instead, atomic energy 
is constrained to a precise set of levels. We call these quanta. As a simple analogy, 
think about driving a car onto a freeway. As you increase your speed, you would normally continuously go 
from, say, 20 miles/hour up to 70 miles/hour. Now, if you had a quantum atomic car, you wouldn't accelerate 
in a linear fashion. Instead, you would instantaneously jump,
or transition, from one speed to the next. For an atom, when a transition 
occurs from one energy level to another, quantum mechanics says that the energy difference 
is equal to a characteristic frequency, multiplied by a constant, where the change in energy is equal to 
a number, called Planck's constant, times the frequency. That characteristic frequency 
is what we need to make our clock. GPS satellites rely on cesium and rubidium
atoms as frequency standards. In the case of cesium 133, the characteristic clock frequency
is 9,192,631,770 Hz. That's 9 billion cycles per second. That's a really fast clock. No matter how skilled a clockmaker may be, every pendulum, wind-up mechanism and quartz crystal resonates 
at a slightly different frequency. However, every cesium 133 atom 
in the universe oscillates at the same exact frequency. So thanks to the atomic clock, we get a time reading accurate
to within 1 billionth of a second, and a very precise measurement
of the distance from that satellite. Let's ignore the fact that you're almost
definitely on Earth. We now know that you're at a fixed 
distance from the satellite. In other words, you're somewhere 
on the surface of a sphere centered around the satellite. Measure your distance 
from a second satellite and you get another overlapping sphere. Keep doing that, and with just four measurements, and a little correction 
using Einstein's theory of relativity, you can pinpoint your location to exactly
one point in space. So that's all it takes: a multibillion-dollar 
network of satellites, oscillating cesium atoms, quantum mechanics, relativity, a smartphone, and you. No problem.

You know how sometimes
you go to bake a cake but your bananas have all gone rotten, your utensils have rusted, you trip and pour all of your baking soda
into the vinegar jug, and then your oven explodes? My friend, you and your chemical reactions
have fallen victim to enthalpy and entropy and, boy, are they forces 
to be reckoned with. Now, your reactants are all products. So, what are these "E" words,
and what's their big idea? Let's start with enthalpy, an increase or decrease of energy
during a chemical reaction. Every molecule has a certain amount
of chemical potential energy stored within the bonds between its atoms. Chemicals with more energy 
are less stable, and thus, more likely to react. Let's visualize the energy flow 
in a reaction, the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen,
by playing a round of crazy golf. Our goal is to get a ball, the reactant,
up a small rise and down the other much steeper slope. Where the hill goes up,
we need to add energy to the ball, and where it goes down, the ball releases
energy into its surroundings. The hole represents the product,
or result of the reaction. When the reaction period ends,
the ball is inside the hole, and we have our product: water. This, like when our oven exploded,
is an exothermic reaction, meaning that the chemical's final energy
is less than its starting energy, and the difference has been added
to the surrounding environment as light and heat. We can also play out
the opposite type of reaction, an endothermic reaction, where the final energy is greater 
than the starting energy. That's what we were trying 
to achieve by baking our cake. The added heat from the oven would 
change the chemical structure of the proteins in the eggs
and various compounds in the butter. So that's enthalpy. As you might suspect, exothermic reactions are more likely 
to happen than endothermic ones because they require less energy to occur. But there's another independent factor
that can make reactions happen: entropy. Entropy measures a chemical's randomness. Here's an enormous pyramid of golf balls. Its ordered structure 
means it has low entropy. However, when it collapses, 
we have chaos everywhere, balls bouncing high and wide. So much so that some 
even go over the hill. This shift to instability, 
or higher entropy, can allow reactions to happen. As with the golf balls, 
in actual chemicals this transition from structure to disorder
gets some reactants past the hump and lets them start a reaction. You can see both enthalpy
and entropy at play when you go to light 
a campfire to cook dinner. Your match adds enough energy to activate the exothermic reaction
of combustion, converting the high-energy 
combustible material in the wood to lower energy carbon dioxide and water. Entropy also increases
and helps the reaction along because the neat, organized log of wood is now converted into randomly moving
water vapor and carbon dioxide. The energy shed by this 
exothermic reaction powers the endothermic reaction
of cooking your dinner. Bon appétit!

to happen than endothermic ones because they require less energy to occur. But there's another independent factor
that can make reactions happen: entropy. Entropy measures a chemical's randomness. Here's an enormous pyramid of golf balls. Its ordered structure 
means it has low entropy. However, when it collapses, 
we have chaos everywhere, balls bouncing high and wide. So much so that some 
even go over the hill. This shift to instability, 
or higher entropy, can allow reactions to happen. As with the golf balls, 
in actual chemicals this transition from structure to disorder
gets some reactants past the hump and lets them start a reaction. You can see both enthalpy
and entropy at play when you go to light 
a campfire to cook dinner. Your match adds enough energy to activate the exothermic reaction
of combustion, converting the high-energy 
combustible material in the wood to lower energy carbon dioxide and water. Entropy also increases
and helps the reaction along because the neat, organized log of wood is now converted into randomly moving
water vapor and carbon dioxide. The energy shed by this 
exothermic reaction powers the endothermic reaction
of cooking your dinner. Bon appétit!

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

**Transcript**:
You know how sometimes
you go to bake a cake but your bananas have all gone rotten, your utensils have rusted, you trip and pour all of your baking soda
into the vinegar jug, and then your oven explodes? My friend, you and your chemical reactions
have fallen victim to enthalpy and entropy and, boy, are they forces 
to be reckoned with. Now, your reactants are all products. So, what are these "E" words,
and what's their big idea? Let's start with enthalpy, an increase or decrease of energy
during a chemical reaction. Every molecule has a certain amount
of chemical potential energy stored within the bonds between its atoms. Chemicals with more energy 
are less stable, and thus, more likely to react. Let's visualize the energy flow 
in a reaction, the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen,
by playing a round of crazy golf. Our goal is to get a ball, the reactant,
up a small rise and down the other much steeper slope. Where the hill goes up,
we need to add energy to the ball, and where it goes down, the ball releases
energy into its surroundings. The hole represents the product,
or result of the reaction. When the reaction period ends,
the ball is inside the hole, and we have our product: water. This, like when our oven exploded,
is an exothermic reaction, meaning that the chemical's final energy
is less than its starting energy, and the difference has been added
to the surrounding environment as light and heat. We can also play out
the opposite type of reaction, an endothermic reaction, where the final energy is greater 
than the starting energy. That's what we were trying 
to achieve by baking our cake. The added heat from the oven would 
change the chemical structure of the proteins in the eggs
and various compounds in the butter. So that's enthalpy. As you might suspect, exothermic reactions are more likely 
to happen than endothermic ones because they require less energy to occur. But there's another independent factor
that can make reactions happen: entropy. Entropy measures a chemical's randomness. Here's an enormous pyramid of golf balls. Its ordered structure

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 7, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 4
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Imagine that day by day, your field of vision 
becomes slightly smaller, narrowing or dimming until eventually you go completely blind. We tend to think of blindness
as something you're born with, but in fact, with many diseases
like Retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, blindness can start developing
when you're a kid, or even when you're an adult. Both of these rare genetic diseases
affect the retina, the screen at the back of the eye
that detects light and helps us see. Now imagine if the eye 
could regenerate itself so that a blind person could see again. To understand if that's possible,
we need to grasp how the retina works and what it has to do 
with a multitalented creature named the zebrafish. The human retina is made
of different layers of cells, with special neurons 
that live in the back of the eye called rod and cone photoreceptors. Photoreceptors convert 
the light coming into your eye into signals that the brain uses 
to generate vision. People who have Usher syndrome
and retinitis pigmentosa experience a steady loss 
of these photoreceptors until finally that screen in the eye
can no longer detect light nor broadcast signals to the brain. Unlike most of your body's cells,
photoreceptors don't divide and multiply. We're born with all 
the photoreceptors we'll ever have, which is why babies 
have such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish,
a master regenerator. It can grow back its skin, bones, heart
and retina after they've been damaged. If photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina
are removed or killed by toxins, they just regenerate and rewire 
themselves to the brain to restore sight. Scientists have been investigating
this superpower because zebrafish retina are also 
structured very much like human retina. Scientists can even mimic the effects
of disorders like Usher syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa
on the zebrafish eye. This allows them to see how zebrafish
go about repairing their retinas so they might use similar tactics
to fix human eyes one day, too. So what's behind 
the zebrafish's superpower? The main players are sets of long cells
that stretch across the retina called Müller glia. When the photoreceptors are damaged,
these cells transform, taking on a new character. They become less like Müller cells
and more like stem cells, which can turn into any kind of cell. Then these long cells divide, producing extras that will eventually
grow into new photoreceptors, travel to the back of the eye
and rewire themselves into the brain. And now some researchers even think
they've found the key to how this works with the help of one of two chemicals
that create activity in the brain called glutamate
and aminoadipate. In mouse eyes, these make the Müller glia divide
and transform into photoreceptors, which then travel 
to the back of the retina, like they're replenishing a failing army
with new soldiers. But remember, none of this has happened
in our retinas yet, so the question is how do we trigger 
this transformation of the Müller glia in the human eye? How can we fully control this process? How do photoreceptors 
rewire themselves into the retina? And is it even possible 
to trigger this in humans? Or has this mechanism been lost
over time in evolution? Until we tease apart 
the origins of this ability, retinal regeneration will remain 
a mysterious superpower of the common zebrafish.

have such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish,
a master regenerator. It can grow back its skin, bones, heart
and retina after they've been damaged. If photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina
are removed or killed by toxins, they just regenerate and rewire 
themselves to the brain to restore sight. Scientists have been investigating
this superpower because zebrafish retina are also 
structured very much like human retina. Scientists can even mimic the effects
of disorders like Usher syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa
on the zebrafish eye. This allows them to see how zebrafish
go about repairing their retinas so they might use similar tactics
to fix human eyes one day, too. So what's behind 
the zebrafish's superpower? The main players are sets of long cells
that stretch across the retina called Müller glia. When the photoreceptors are damaged,
these cells transform, taking on a new character. They become less like Müller cells
and more like stem cells, which can turn into any kind of cell. Then these long cells divide, producing extras that will eventually
grow into new photoreceptors, travel to the back of the eye
and rewire themselves into the brain. And now some researchers even think
they've found the key to how this works with the help of one of two chemicals
that create activity in the brain called glutamate
and aminoadipate. In mouse eyes, these make the Müller glia divide
and transform into photoreceptors, which then travel 
to the back of the retina, like they're replenishing a failing army
with new soldiers. But remember, none of this has happened
in our retinas yet, so the question is how do we trigger 
this transformation of the Müller glia in the human eye? How can we fully control this process? How do photoreceptors 
rewire themselves into the retina? And is it even possible 
to trigger this in humans? Or has this mechanism been lost
over time in evolution? Until we tease apart 
the origins of this ability, retinal regeneration will remain 
a mysterious superpower of the common zebrafish.

**Transcript**:
Imagine that day by day, your field of vision 
becomes slightly smaller, narrowing or dimming until eventually you go completely blind. We tend to think of blindness
as something you're born with, but in fact, with many diseases
like Retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, blindness can start developing
when you're a kid, or even when you're an adult. Both of these rare genetic diseases
affect the retina, the screen at the back of the eye
that detects light and helps us see. Now imagine if the eye 
could regenerate itself so that a blind person could see again. To understand if that's possible,
we need to grasp how the retina works and what it has to do 
with a multitalented creature named the zebrafish. The human retina is made
of different layers of cells, with special neurons 
that live in the back of the eye called rod and cone photoreceptors. Photoreceptors convert 
the light coming into your eye into signals that the brain uses 
to generate vision. People who have Usher syndrome
and retinitis pigmentosa experience a steady loss 
of these photoreceptors until finally that screen in the eye
can no longer detect light nor broadcast signals to the brain. Unlike most of your body's cells,
photoreceptors don't divide and multiply. We're born with all 
the photoreceptors we'll ever have, which is why babies 
have such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish,

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You probably don't need to be told 
how important your brain is. After all, every single thing 
you experience, your thoughts and your actions, your perceptions and your memories are processed here 
in your body's control center. But if this already seems like a lot
for a single organ to handle, it's actually only a small 
part of what the brain does. Most of its activities are ones 
you'd never be aware of, unless they suddenly stopped. The brain is made up 
of billions of neurons, and trillions of connections. Neurons can be activated 
by specific stimuli or thoughts, but they are also often 
spontaneously active. Some fire cyclically in a set pattern. Others fire rapidly in short bursts 
before switching off, or remain quiet for long periods until thousands of inputs from other 
neurons line up in just the right way. On a large scale, this results in elaborate rhythms 
of internally generated brain activity, humming quietly in the background whether we're awake, asleep, or trying not to think 
about anything at all. And these spontaneously 
occurring brain functions form the foundation upon which
all other brain functions rely. The most crucial of these automatically
occurring activities are the ones that keep us alive. For example, while you've been
paying attention to this video spontaneous activity in your brain
has been maintaining your breathing at 12 to 16 breaths a minute,
making sure that you don't suffocate. Without any conscious effort, signals from parts of your brainstem
are sent through the spinal cord to the muscles that inflate your lungs, making them expand and contract,
whether or not you're paying attention. The neuronal circuits underlying such 
rhythmic spontaneous activity are called central pattern generators, and control many 
simple repetitive behaviors, like breathing, walking, and swallowing. Ongoing neural activity also underlies
our sensory perception. It may seem that the neurons in your retina
that translate light into neural signals would remain quiet in the dark, but in fact, the retinal ganglion cells 
that communicate with the brain are always active. And the signals they send are increases 
and decreases in the rate of activity, rather than separate bursts. So at every level, our nervous system
is teeming with spontaneous activity that helps it interpret and respond
to any signals it might receive. And our brain's autopilot isn't just 
limited to our basic biological functions. Have you ever been on the way home, started thinking 
about what's for dinner, and then realized you don't remember
walking for the past five minutes? While we don't understand all the details, we do know that the ongoing activity
in multiple parts of your brain is somehow able to coordinate 
what is actually a complex task involving both cognitive 
and motor functions, guiding you down the right path
and moving your legs while you're getting dinner figured out. But perhaps the most interesting thing
about spontaneous brain function is its involvement in one 
of the most mysterious and poorly understood phenomena
of our bodies: sleep. You may shut down 
and become inactive at night, but your brain doesn't. While you sleep, ongoing spontaneous activity gradually 
becomes more and more synchronized, eventually developing into large, 
rhythmic neural oscillations that envelop your brain. This transition to the more 
organized rhythms of sleep starts with small clusters of neurons
tucked in the hypothalamus. Despite their small number, these neurons have a huge effect in turning off brainstem regions
that normally keep you awake and alert, letting other parts, 
like the cortex and thalamus, slowly slip into their 
own default rhythms. The deeper we fall into sleep, the slower and more synchronized
this rhythm becomes, with the deepest stages dominated by large
amplitude, low frequency delta waves. But surprisingly, in the middle 
of this slow wave sleep, the brain's synchronized 
spontaneous activity repeatedly transitions
into the sort of varied bursts that occur when we're wide awake. This is the sleep stage
known as REM sleep, where our eyes move rapidly 
back and forth as we dream. Neuroscientists are still trying to answer
many fundamental questions about sleep, such as its role in rejuvenating
cognitive capacity, cellular homeostasis, and strengthening memory. And more broadly, they are exploring how it is that brain can accomplish 
such important and complex tasks, such as driving, or even breathing,
without our awareness. But for now, until we are better able to understand the inner workings
of their spontaneous functioning, we need to give our brains credit
for being much smarter than we ourselves are.

cognitive capacity, cellular homeostasis, and strengthening memory. And more broadly, they are exploring how it is that brain can accomplish 
such important and complex tasks, such as driving, or even breathing,
without our awareness. But for now, until we are better able to understand the inner workings
of their spontaneous functioning, we need to give our brains credit
for being much smarter than we ourselves are.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 9, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In 1796, the scientist Edward Jenner injected material from a cowpox virus
into an eight-year-old boy with a hunch that this would provide
the protection needed to save people from deadly outbreaks
of the related smallpox virus. It was a success. The eight-year-old was inoculated
against the disease and this became the first ever vaccine. But why did it work? To understand how vaccines function, we need to know how the immune system
defends us against contagious diseases in the first place. When foreign microbes invade us, the immune system triggers
a series of responses in an attempt to identify
and remove them from our bodies. The signs that this immune
response is working are the coughing, sneezing,
inflammation and fever we experience, which work to trap, deter and rid the body
of threatening things, like bacteria. These innate immune responses
also trigger our second line of defense, called adaptive immunity. Special cells called B cells and T cells
are recruited to fight microbes, and also record information about them, creating a memory of what
the invaders look like, and how best to fight them. This know-how becomes handy if the same pathogen
invades the body again. But despite this smart response,
there's still a risk involved. The body takes time to learn
how to respond to pathogens and to build up these defenses. And even then, if a body is too weak or young
to fight back when it's invaded, it might face very serious risk
if the pathogen is particularly severe. But what if we could prepare
the body's immune response, readying it before someone even got ill? This is where vaccines come in. Using the same principles
that the body uses to defend itself, scientists use vaccines to trigger
the body's adaptive immune system, without exposing humans
to the full strength disease. This has resulted in many vaccines,
which each work uniquely, separated into many different types. First, we have live attenuated vaccines. These are made of the pathogen itself
but a much weaker and tamer version. Next, we have inactive vaccines,
in which the pathogens have been killed. The weakening and inactivation
in both types of vaccine ensures that pathogens don't develop
into the full blown disease. But just like a disease,
they trigger an immune response, teaching the body to recognize an attack by making a profile
of pathogens in preparation. The downside is that live attenuated
vaccines can be difficult to make, and because they're live
and quite powerful, people with weaker immune systems
can't have them, while inactive vaccines
don't create long-lasting immunity. Another type, the subunit vaccine, is only made from one part
of the pathogen, called an antigen, the ingredient that actually triggers
the immune response. By even further isolating
specific components of antigens, like proteins or polysaccharides, these vaccines can prompt
specific responses. Scientists are now building
a whole new range of vaccines called DNA vaccines. For this variety, they isolate the very
genes that make the specific antigens the body needs to trigger its immune
response to specific pathogens. When injected into the human body, those genes instruct cells
in the body to make the antigens. This causes a stronger immune response, and prepares the body
for any future threats, and because the vaccine only includes
specific genetic material, it doesn't contain any other ingredients
from the rest of the pathogen that could develop into the disease
and harm the patient. If these vaccines become a success, we might be able to build
more effective treatments for invasive pathogens in years to come. Just like Edward Jenner's
amazing discovery spurred on modern medicine
all those decades ago, continuing the development of vaccines might even allow us
to treat diseases like HIV, malaria, or Ebola, one day.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 10, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere 
from a few photons to direct sunlight, or switch focus from 
the screen in front of you to the distant horizon 
in a third of a second. In fact, the structures required
for such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged
that the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd in the 
highest possible degree. And yet, that is exactly what happened,
starting more than 500 million years ago. The story of the human eye begins
with a simple light spot, such as the one found 
in single-celled organisms, like euglena. This is a cluster 
of light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's flagellum, activating when it finds light
and, therefore, food. A more complex version of this light spot
can be found in the flat worm, planaria. Being cupped, rather than flat, enables it to better sense
the direction of the incoming light. Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism
to seek out shade and hide from predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper
in some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing
a thin beam of light into the eye. The nautilus, 
an ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows
for simple images, the key step towards the eye 
as we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering 
the opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity
and processing. Crystalline proteins 
forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina. It is this lens that is the key
to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera
with a lens served as the basis for what would 
eventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount 
of light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer,
known as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete 
a protective film. But equally important was the accompanying evolution
of the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper
and more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces
of its step by step evolution. For example,
the human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away
from the eye opening. This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve
must pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive 
layer in the back. The similar looking eyes 
of cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina,
allowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections
for looking above and under water, perfect for spotting 
both predators and prey. Cats, classically nighttime hunters,
have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light
the eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision,
as well as their signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom. So if you could design an eye, 
would you do it any differently? This question isn't as strange 
as it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking
at different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants
for the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision
and flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass
its own evolution.

starting more than 500 million years ago. The story of the human eye begins
with a simple light spot, such as the one found 
in single-celled organisms, like euglena. This is a cluster 
of light-sensitive proteins linked to the organism's flagellum, activating when it finds light
and, therefore, food. A more complex version of this light spot
can be found in the flat worm, planaria. Being cupped, rather than flat, enables it to better sense
the direction of the incoming light. Among its other uses, this ability allows an organism
to seek out shade and hide from predators. Over the millenia, as such light cups grew deeper
in some organisms, the opening at the front grew smaller. The result was a pinhole effect,
which increased resolution dramatically, reducing distortion by only allowing
a thin beam of light into the eye. The nautilus, 
an ancestor of the octopus, uses this pinhole eye for improved 
resolution and directional sensing. Although the pinhole eye allows
for simple images, the key step towards the eye 
as we know it is a lens. This is thought to have evolved through transparent cells covering 
the opening to prevent infection, allowing the inside of the eye
to fill with fluid that optimizes light sensitivity
and processing. Crystalline proteins 
forming at the surface created a structure that proved useful in focusing light 
at a single point on the retina. It is this lens that is the key
to the eye's adaptability, changing its curvature to adapt
to near and far vision. This structure of the pinhole camera
with a lens served as the basis for what would 
eventually evolve into the human eye. Further refinements would include
a colored ring, called the iris, that controls the amount 
of light entering the eye, a tough white outer layer,
known as the sclera, to maintain its structure, and tear glands that secrete 
a protective film. But equally important was the accompanying evolution
of the brain, with its expansion of the visual cortex to process the sharper
and more colorful images it was receiving. We now know that far from being
an ideal masterpiece of design, our eye bares traces
of its step by step evolution. For example,
the human retina is inverted, with light-detecting cells facing away
from the eye opening. This results in a blind spot, where the optic nerve
must pierce the retina to reach the photosensitive 
layer in the back. The similar looking eyes 
of cephalopods, which evolved independently, have a front-facing retina,
allowing them to see without a blind spot. Other creatures' eyes display
different adaptations. Anableps, the so called four-eyed fish, have eyes divided in two sections
for looking above and under water, perfect for spotting 
both predators and prey. Cats, classically nighttime hunters,
have evolved with a reflective layer maximizing the amount of light
the eye can detect, granting them excellent night vision,
as well as their signature glow. These are just a few examples of the huge 
diversity of eyes in the animal kingdom. So if you could design an eye, 
would you do it any differently? This question isn't as strange 
as it might sound. Today, doctors and scientists are looking
at different eye structures to help design biomechanical implants
for the vision impaired. And in the not so distant future, the machines built with the precision
and flexibilty of the human eye may even enable it to surpass
its own evolution.

The human eye is an amazing mechanism, able to detect anywhere 
from a few photons to direct sunlight, or switch focus from 
the screen in front of you to the distant horizon 
in a third of a second. In fact, the structures required
for such incredible flexibility were once considered so complex that Charles Darwin himself acknowledged
that the idea of there having evolved seemed absurd in the

**Transcript**:
As 1905 dawned, the soon-to-be 26-year-old Albert Einstein
faced life as a failed academic. Most physicists of the time
would have scoffed at the idea that this minor civil servant
could have much to contribute to science. Yet within the following year, Einstein would publish not one, not two, not three, but four extraordinary papers,
each on a different topic, that were destined to radically transform
our understanding of the universe. The myth that Einstein
had failed math is just that. He had mastered calculus on his own
by the age of 15 and done well at both
his Munich secondary school and at the Swiss Polytechnic, where he studied for
a math and physics teaching diploma. But skipping classes to spend
more time in the lab and neglecting to show proper deference
to his professors had derailed his intended career path. Passed over even
for a lab assistant position, he had to settle for a job
at the Swiss patent office, obtained with the help
of a friend's father. Working six days a week as a patent clerk, Einstein still managed to make
some time for physics, discussing the latest work
with a few close friends, and publishing a couple of minor papers. It came as a major surprise when in March 1905 he submitted
a paper with a shocking hypothesis. Despite decades of evidence
that light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it could,
in fact, be a particle, showing that mysterious phenomena,
such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by his hypothesis. The idea was derided for years to come, but Einstein was simply
twenty years ahead of his time. Wave-particle duality was slated to become
a cornerstone of the quantum revolution. Two months later in May,
Einstein submitted a second paper, this time tackling the centuries old
question of whether atoms actually exist. Though certain theories were built on
the idea of invisible atoms, some prominent scientists still
believed them to be a useful fiction, rather than actual physical objects. But Einstein used an ingenious argument, showing that the behavior
of small particles randomly moving around in a liquid,
known as Brownian motion, could be precisely predicted by the collisions of millions
of invisible atoms. Experiments soon confirmed
Einstein's model, and atomic skeptics threw in the towel. The third paper came in June. For a long time, Einstein had been troubled
by an inconsistency between two fundamental
principles of physics. The well established
principle of relativity, going all the way back to Galileo, stated that absolute motion
could not be defined. Yet electromagnetic theory,
also well established, asserted that absolute motion did exist. The discrepancy,
and his inability to resolve it, left Einstein in what he described
as a state of psychic tension. But one day in May, after he had mulled over the puzzle
with his friend Michele Besso, the clouds parted. Einstein realized
that the contradiction could be resolved if it was the speed of light
that remained constant, regardless of reference frame, while both time and space
were relative to the observer. It took Einstein only a few weeks
to work out the details and formulate what came to be known
as special relativity. The theory not only shattered
our previous understanding of reality but would also pave the way
for technologies, ranging from particle accelerators, to the global positioning system. One might think that this was enough, but in September, a fourth paper arrived as a "by the way"
follow-up to the special relativity paper. Einstein had thought a little bit more
about his theory, and realized it also implied
that mass and energy, one apparently solid
and the other supposedly ethereal, were actually equivalent. And their relationship could be expressed
in what was to become the most famous and consequential equation in history: E=mc^2. Einstein would not become a world famous
icon for nearly another fifteen years. It was only after his later general theory
of relativity was confirmed in 1919 by measuring the bending of starlight
during a solar eclipse that the press would turn him
into a celebrity. But even if he had disappeared back
into the patent office and accomplished nothing else after 1905, those four papers of his miracle year would have remained the gold standard
of startling unexpected genius.

with his friend Michele Besso, the clouds parted. Einstein realized
that the contradiction could be resolved if it was the speed of light
that remained constant, regardless of reference frame, while both time and space
were relative to the observer. It took Einstein only a few weeks
to work out the details and formulate what came to be known
as special relativity. The theory not only shattered
our previous understanding of reality but would also pave the way
for technologies, ranging from particle accelerators, to the global positioning system. One might think that this was enough, but in September, a fourth paper arrived as a "by the way"
follow-up to the special relativity paper. Einstein had thought a little bit more
about his theory, and realized it also implied
that mass and energy, one apparently solid
and the other supposedly ethereal, were actually equivalent. And their relationship could be expressed
in what was to become the most famous and consequential equation in history: E=mc^2. Einstein would not become a world famous
icon for nearly another fifteen years. It was only after his later general theory
of relativity was confirmed in 1919 by measuring the bending of starlight
during a solar eclipse that the press would turn him
into a celebrity. But even if he had disappeared back
into the patent office and accomplished nothing else after 1905, those four papers of his miracle year would have remained the gold standard
of startling unexpected genius.

**Transcript**:
As 1905 dawned, the soon-to-be 26-year-old Albert Einstein
faced life as a failed academic. Most physicists of the time
would have scoffed at the idea that this minor civil servant
could have much to contribute to science. Yet within the following year, Einstein would publish not one, not two, not three, but four extraordinary papers,
each on a different topic, that were destined to radically transform
our understanding of the universe. The myth that Einstein
had failed math is just that. He had mastered calculus on his own
by the age of 15 and done well at both
his Munich secondary school and at the Swiss Polytechnic, where he studied for
a math and physics teaching diploma. But skipping classes to spend
more time in the lab and neglecting to show proper deference
to his professors had derailed his intended career path. Passed over even
for a lab assistant position, he had to settle for a job
at the Swiss patent office, obtained with the help
of a friend's father. Working six days a week as a patent clerk, Einstein still managed to make
some time for physics, discussing the latest work
with a few close friends, and publishing a couple of minor papers. It came as a major surprise when in March 1905 he submitted
a paper with a shocking hypothesis. Despite decades of evidence
that light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it could,
in fact, be a particle, showing that mysterious phenomena,
such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by his hypothesis. The idea was derided for years to come, but Einstein was simply
twenty years ahead of his time. Wave-particle duality was slated to become
a cornerstone of the quantum revolution. Two months later in May,
Einstein submitted a second paper, this time tackling the centuries old
question of whether atoms actually exist. Though certain theories were built on
the idea of invisible atoms, some prominent scientists still
believed them to be a useful fiction, rather than actual physical objects. But Einstein used an ingenious argument, showing that the behavior
of small particles randomly moving around in a liquid,
known as Brownian motion, could be precisely predicted by the collisions of millions
of invisible atoms. Experiments soon confirmed
Einstein's model, and atomic skeptics threw in the towel. The third paper came in June. For a long time, Einstein had been troubled
by an inconsistency between two fundamental
principles of physics. The well established
principle of relativity, going all the way back to Galileo, stated that absolute motion
could not be defined. Yet electromagnetic theory,
also well established, asserted that absolute motion did exist. The discrepancy,
and his inability to resolve it, left Einstein in what he described
as a state of psychic tension. But one day in May, after he had mulled over the puzzle
with his friend Michele Besso, the clouds parted. Einstein realized
that the contradiction could be resolved if it was the speed of light

**Transcript**:
This holiday season, people around the world will give
and receive presents. You might even get 
a knitted sweater from an aunt. But what if instead of saying "thanks"
before consigning it to the closet, the polite response expected from you was to show up to her house 
in a week with a better gift? Or to vote for her in the town election? Or let her adopt your firstborn child? All of these things might not 
sound so strange if you are involved in a gift economy. This phrase might seem contradictory. After all, isn't a gift given for free? But in a gift economy,
gifts given without explicit conditions are used to foster a system
of social ties and obligations. While the market economies we know 
are formed by relationships between the things being traded, a gift economy consists 
of the relationships between the people doing the trading. Gift economies have existed 
throughout human history. The first studies of the concept came from anthropologists 
Bronislaw Malinowski and Marcel Mauss who describe the natives 
of the Trobriand islands making dangerous canoe journeys 
across miles of ocean to exchange shell necklaces
and arm bands. The items traded through this process,
known as the kula ring, have no practical use, but derive importance 
from their original owners and carry an obligation 
to continue the exchange. Other gift economies 
may involve useful items, such as the potlatch feast 
of the Pacific Northwest, where chiefs compete for prestige 
by giving away livestock and blankets. We might say that instead 
of accumulating material wealth, participants in a gift economy 
use it to accumulate social wealth. Though some instances of gift economies
may resemble barter, the difference is that the original gift 
is given without any preconditions or haggling. Instead, the social norm of reciprocity obligates recipients to voluntarily 
return the favor. But the rules for how and when to do so 
vary between cultures, and the return on a gift 
can take many forms. A powerful chief giving 
livestock to a poor man may not expect goods in return, but gains social prestige 
at the debtor's expense. And among the Toraja people of Indonesia, the status gained from gift ceremonies 
even determines land ownership. The key is to keep the gift cycle going, with someone always 
indebted to someone else. Repaying a gift immediately, or with something of exactly equal value, may be read as ending 
the social relationship. So, are gift economies exclusive 
to small-scale societies outside the industrialized world? Not quite. For one thing, even in these cultures, gift economies function alongside 
a market system for other exchanges. And when we think about it, parts of our own societies 
work in similar ways. Communal spaces, such as Burning Man, operate as a mix of barter 
and a gift economy, where selling things 
for money is strictly taboo. In art and technology, gift economies are emerging 
as an alternative to intellectual property where artists, musicians, and open-source developers distribute their creative works, 
not for financial profit, but to raise their social profile 
or establish their community role. And even potluck dinners 
and holiday gift traditions involve some degree 
of reciprocity and social norms. We might wonder if a gift is truly a gift if it comes with obligations 
or involves some social pay off. But this is missing the point. Our idea of a free gift 
without social obligations prevails only if we already think 
of everything in market terms. And in a commericalized world, the idea of strengthening bonds 
through giving and reciprocity may not be such a bad thing,
wherever you may live.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Slavery, the treatment of human beings as property,
deprived of personal rights, has occurred in many forms 
throughout the world. But one institution stands out for
both its global scale and its lasting legacy. The Atlantic slave trade, occurring from the late 15th
to the mid 19th century and spanning three continents, forcibly brought more than 10 million Africans
to the Americas. The impact it would leave affected
not only these slaves and their descendants, but the economies and histories
of large parts of the world. There had been centuries of contact
between Europe and Africa via the Mediterranean. But the Atlantic slave trade 
began in the late 1400s with Portuguese colonies in West Africa, and Spanish settlement 
of the Americas shortly after. The crops grown in the new colonies,
sugar cane, tobacco, and cotton, were labor intensive, and there were not enough settlers 
or indentured servants to cultivate all the new land. American Natives were enslaved, 
but many died from new diseases, while others effectively resisted. And so to meet the massive 
demand for labor, the Europeans looked to Africa. African slavery had existed 
for centuries in various forms. Some slaves were indentured servants, with a limited term 
and the chance to buy one's freedom. Others were more like European serfs. In some societies, slaves could 
be part of a master's family, own land, and even rise 
to positions of power. But when white captains came offering 
manufactured goods, weapons, and rum for slaves, African kings and merchants 
had little reason to hesitate. They viewed the people they sold 
not as fellow Africans but criminals, debtors, 
or prisoners of war from rival tribes. By selling them, kings enriched 
their own realms, and strengthened them 
against neighboring enemies. African kingdoms prospered 
from the slave trade, but meeting the European's massive demand
created intense competition. Slavery replaced other criminal sentences, and capturing slaves 
became a motivation for war, rather than its result. To defend themselves from slave raids, neighboring kingdoms 
needed European firearms, which they also bought with slaves. The slave trade had become an arms race, altering societies and economies 
across the continent. As for the slaves themselves,
they faced unimaginable brutality. After being marched 
to slave forts on the coast, shaved to prevent lice, and branded, they were loaded onto ships 
bound for the Americas. About 20% of them 
would never see land again. Most captains of the day 
were tight packers, cramming as many men 
as possible below deck. While the lack of sanitation 
caused many to die of disease, and others were thrown 
overboard for being sick, or as discipline, the captain's ensured their profits 
by cutting off slave's ears as proof of purchase. Some captives took matters 
into their own hands. Many inland Africans 
had never seen whites before, and thought them to be cannibals, constantly taking people away 
and returning for more. Afraid of being eaten, 
or just to avoid further suffering, they committed suicide 
or starved themselves, believing that in death,
their souls would return home. Those who survived 
were completley dehumanized, treated as mere cargo. Women and children were kept above deck
and abused by the crew, while the men were made to perform dances in order to keep them exercised 
and curb rebellion. What happened to those Africans 
who reached the New World and how the legacy of slavery 
still affects their descendants today is fairly well known. But what is not often discussed is the effect that the Atlantic slave trade
had on Africa's future. Not only did the continent lose
tens of millions of its able-bodied population, but because most of the slaves 
taken were men, the long-term demographic 
effect was even greater. When the slave trade was finally 
outlawed in the Americas and Europe, the African kingdoms whose economies 
it had come to dominate collapsed, leaving them open 
to conquest and colonization. And the increased competition 
and influx of European weapons fueled warfare and instability 
that continues to this day. The Atlantic slave trade also contributed
to the development of racist ideology. Most African slavery had no deeper reason
than legal punishment or intertribal warfare, but the Europeans 
who preached a universal religion, and who had long ago 
outlawed enslaving fellow Christians, needed justification for a practice so obviously at odds 
with their ideals of equality. So they claimed that 
Africans were biologically inferior and destined to be slaves, making great efforts 
to justify this theory. Thus, slavery in Europe and the Americas
acquired a racial basis, making it impossible for slaves 
and their future descendants to attain equal status in society. In all of these ways, the Atlantic slave trade 
was an injustice on a massive scale whose impact has continued 
long after its abolition.

**Transcript**:
Flying through the night, 
I watch over this world, a silent guardian, a watchful protector,
a dark knight, I'm... Okay, fine. So, I'm not Batman.
I'm just a bat. But like Batman, I'm often misunderstood. People think I'm scary, 
strange and dangerous. If they only knew my story, though,
I'd be cheered as a hero. When people think of bats, many think of vampires 
who want to suck their blood. But the truth is 
that out of over 1200 bat species, only three are vampire bats. Out of these three, 
only one prefers the blood of mammals, and even these bats mostly feed on cattle. Maybe that still doesn't seem so great, but vampire bats 
can be a great help to humans. A chemical known as desmoteplase 
found in vampire bat saliva helps break down blood clots, and is being tested 
by recovering stroke victims. Of the remaining 1000+ species of bats, 
about 70% feed on insects. These bats help control 
the real vampires: mosquitos, whose nasty bites
are not just annoying but spread diseases, like West Nile virus. A single little brown bat 
can eat 1000 insects every hour, and a colony of Mexican free-tailed bats 
can eat several tons of moths in just one night. In the United States alone, bats provide an estimated 
3.7 billion dollars worth of free pest control for farmers, which benefits everyone 
who eats the foods that they grow. Fruit bats, also called megabats 
because of their large size, are important for the role 
they play in plant pollination. By traveling between flowers 
while feeding on nectar and fruits, these bats transport the pollen 
and seeds that help plants reproduce. In Southeast Asia, for example, the cave nectar bat is the only pollinator
of the durian fruit. Other bats pollinate peaches, bananas, and the agave plants 
that tequila is made from. Without them, many of our food plants would be unable 
to produce the tasty fruits we enjoy. As heroes of the ecosystem, 
bats have their own unique utility belts. Bats have been a source of inspiration 
for the design of flying robots and even an energy-efficient spy plane, as they are the only mammal 
capable of true powered flight. Echolocation, a type of biological sonar,
is also used by bats as a way to navigate and find prey in the dark. Although there's a common 
misconception that bats are blind, in truth, all species of bats have sight. And some have even adapted 
large eyes to see better in dim lighting. Many people worry 
about getting infected by bats, and like any other animals,
bats can carry diseases, like rabies. In reality, though, less than .5% of all bats
carry this virus. That's about the same odds as getting 
the same result on a coin flip eight times in a row. The perception that bats 
are often diseased may come from the fact that sick bats, who may show unusual behavior, 
emerge during the daytime, or be unable to fly, are more likely to be 
encountered by people. So a good way to protect yourself 
is to protect bats as well, keeping them healthy,
protecting their habitats, and reducing their risk 
of transmitting disease. In North America, bats are threatened 
by a devastating sickness called white-nose syndrome. This fungal infection 
causes bats to wake up while hibernating during a winter. Unable to find food, 
they expend large amounts of energy, and eventually starve to death. White-nose syndrome has wiped out
entire caves full of bats, with a mortality rate that can exceed 90%. Climate change and habitat destruction also pose serious threats 
to bat populations. For example, in January 2014,
a record heat wave in Australia caused over 100,000 bats 
to die from heat exhaustion. Some people just want 
to watch the world burn, and bats all over the world are threatened
by damage to the places that we call home, including mangrove swamps, old-growth forests, and, of course, bat caves. So even though I'm the hero of the story,
I do need to be saved. And now that you know 
the true story about us bats, you can learn how to protect 
such heroic animals. Install a properly designed bat box, one of the easiest ways 
to provide shelter for bats. Discourage the use of pesticides,
which can harm bats when we try to feed on the insects 
you want to get rid of in the first place. Avoid going into caves 
where you might disturb hibernating bats, and always decontaminate 
your gear after visiting a cave. If you have unwanted bats 
living in an attic or barn, contact your local government 
to safely and humanely relocate us. And if you come across a bat, 
do not attempt to handle it, but instead, call Animal Control. Batman might want to keep 
his identity secret, but a great way to help real bats
is by continuing to learn about them and spreading the truth 
that they are real heroes, even if their good deeds are often unseen.

**Transcript**:
For as far back
as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated 
with death and resurrection. Nearly every religion in the world 
has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters,
the dead keep coming back. But is resurrection really possible? And what is the actual difference between 
a living creature and a dead body, anyway? To understand what death is, 
we need to understand what life is. One ancient theory 
was an idea called vitalism, which claimed 
that living things were unique because they were filled 
with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life. Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence 
was common throughout the world, and still persists 
in the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources 
that can replenish it. Vitalism began to fade 
in the Western world following the Scientific Revolution 
in the 17th century. René Descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially 
no different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul
located in the brain's pineal gland. And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall 
even claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately
before and after death in an attempt to prove it. Though his experiments were discredited,
much like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory 
still come up in popular culture. But where do all these discredited 
theories leave us? What we now know is 
that life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing 
biological processes themselves. And to understand these processes, we need to zoom down 
to the level of our individual cells. Inside each of these cells, chemical reactions 
are constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen
that our bodies convert into the energy-carrying molecule
known as ATP. Cells use this energy
for everything from repair to growth to reproduction. Not only does it take a lot of energy 
to make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more 
to get them where they need to be. The universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend 
towards diffusing randomly, moving from areas 
of high concentration to low concentration, or even breaking apart 
into smaller molecules and atoms. So cells must constantly keep 
entropy in check by using energy to maintain 
their molecules in the very complicated formations necessary for biological functions
to occur. The breaking down of these arrangements 
when the entire cell succumbs to entropy is what eventually results in death. This is the reason organisms 
can't be simply sparked back to life once they've already died. We can pump air into someone's lungs, but it won't do much good if the many other processes
involved in the respiratory cycle are no longer functioning. Similarly, the electric shock
from a defibrillator doesn't jump-start an inanimate heart, but resynchronizes the muscle cells 
in an abnormally beating heart so they regain their normal rhythm. This can prevent a person from dying, 
but it won't raise a dead body, or a monster sewn together 
from dead bodies. So it would seem 
that all our various medical miracles can delay or prevent death
but not reverse it. But that's not as simple as it sounds because constant advancements 
in technology and medicine have resulted in diagnoses such as coma, describing potentially 
reversible conditions, under which people would have previously 
been considered dead. In the future, the point of no return 
may be pushed even further. Some animals are known 
to extend their lifespans or survive extreme conditions by slowing down their biological processes to the point where 
they are virtually paused. And research into cryonics 
hopes to achieve the same by freezing dying people 
and reviving them later when newer technology 
is able to help them. See, if the cells are frozen, 
there's very little molecular movement, and diffusion practically stops. Even if all of a person's cellular 
processes had already broken down, this could still conceivably be reversed 
by a swarm of nanobots, moving all the molecules 
back to their proper positions, and injecting all of the cells 
with ATP at the same time, presumably causing the body 
to simply pick up where it left off. So if we think of life 
not as some magical spark, but a state of incredibly complex,
self-perpetuating organization, death is just 
the process of increasing entropy that destroys this fragile balance. And the point at which 
someone is completely dead turns out not to be a fixed constant, but simply a matter 
of how much of this entropy we're currently capable of reversing.

**Transcript**:
For as far back
as we can trace our existence, humans have been fascinated 
with death and resurrection. Nearly every religion in the world 
has some interpretation of them, and from our earliest myths to the latest cinematic blockbusters,
the dead keep coming back. But is resurrection really possible? And what is the actual difference between 
a living creature and a dead body, anyway? To understand what death is, 
we need to understand what life is. One ancient theory 
was an idea called vitalism, which claimed 
that living things were unique because they were filled 
with a special substance, or energy, that was the essence of life. Whether it was called qi, lifeblood, or humors, the belief in such an essence 
was common throughout the world, and still persists 
in the stories of creatures who can somehow drain life from others, or some form of magical sources 
that can replenish it. Vitalism began to fade 
in the Western world following the Scientific Revolution 
in the 17th century. René Descartes advanced the notion that the human body was essentially 
no different from any other machine, brought to life by a divinely created soul
located in the brain's pineal gland. And in 1907, Dr. Duncan McDougall 
even claimed that the soul had mass, weighing patients immediately
before and after death in an attempt to prove it. Though his experiments were discredited,
much like the rest of vitalism, traces of his theory 
still come up in popular culture. But where do all these discredited 
theories leave us? What we now know is 
that life is not contained in some magical substance or spark, but within the ongoing 
biological processes themselves. And to understand these processes, we need to zoom down 
to the level of our individual cells. Inside each of these cells, chemical reactions 
are constantly occurring, powered by the glucose and oxygen
that our bodies convert into the energy-carrying molecule
known as ATP. Cells use this energy
for everything from repair to growth to reproduction. Not only does it take a lot of energy 
to make the necessary molecules, but it takes even more 
to get them where they need to be. The universal phenomenon of entropy means that molecules will tend

**Transcript**:
What lights up the screen 
that you're looking at right now? Trace back 
the battery chargers and power cords and you'll end up at an electrical outlet, providing easy, safe access 
to reliable electricity. But beyond that outlet, 
the picture gets messier. It takes a lot of fuel to heat our homes, preserve our food, and our power our gadgets 
around the clock. And for 40% of the world, 
that fuel is cheap, plentiful, and it's called coal. But coal also releases 
pollutants into the air, like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, soot, and toxic metals, like mercury. These cause environmental damage,
like acid rain, and serious health problems. In fact, in 1952, coal burning 
caused such heavy smog in London that pedestrians 
couldn't even see their feet, and thousands of people died
from ill health. Since then, many countries 
have deployed technology to remove most of these pollutants 
before they reach the air. But now we have a new 
air pollution problem on our hands, one that doesn't show up 
in a cloud of dark smog, but in rising seas, floods, and heat waves. It's global climate change, and again, the main culprit is coal. It's responsible for 44%
of global carbon dioxide emissions, which trap the sun's heat 
in the Earth's atmosphere, instead of letting it escape. So now the question is 
how do we remove that bad stuff as well? That's the idea behind cleaner coal. Creating cleaner coal is really about 
trying to contain its ill effects with the help of special technologies
that make the end product more acceptable. Just like the most intriguing superheroes often have their own dark powers 
to overcome, so we can try and keep 
coal's negative forces in check. But why don't we just exterminate coal if it takes that much effort
to clean it up? Simply, coal is extremely valuable to us,
and it's easy to come by. Compressed underground for ages, coal holds chemical energy from plants that were fed from by the sun 
hundreds of millions of years ago, long before humans evolved. That makes coal energy dense, 
meaning it can be burned 'round the clock. It's also cheap, 
if you ignore the pollution costs, and should last us 
through the end of the 21st century. We've already got all the infrastructure 
in place for harnessing its power, and globally, although countries are making a move towards energy from
cleaner and more renewable sources, there's no sign yet 
that coal use is slowing down. In fact, as of 2012, over 1000 new coal plants 
have been proposed, mostly in China and India. Since for the time being 
coal is here to stay, experts say that if we want to reduce 
its emissions' impact on the atmosphere, and slow down climate change, we'll have to think of creative ways 
of reducing coal's destructive power. To do that, we need 
to strip it of its foul forces, all that toxic carbon dioxide 
that causes havoc in the atmosphere. Then, we need to store 
the CO2 somewhere else. This mission is called 
carbon capture and sequestration, or CCS. And as if carbon dioxide were some 
evil genie we didn't want to escape, once it has been separated from coal, we've devised ways 
to banish it underground. We can do this by injecting it 
deep into the Earth, or by placing it deep 
under the ocean's surface. Stripping away coal's negative elements
can happen in three ways. First, and most commonly, as coal burns, the exhaust gas can be mixed 
with a compound called monoethanolamine. Like a forceful power-stripping magnet,
this compound bonds to the CO2, yanking it out of the gas stream so it can be stored 
separately underground. Another method is 
to relieve coal of its CO2 before it even has a chance 
to be released as exhaust. In this process, steam and oxygen 
swoop in to the rescue to convert coal into a special 
product called syngas, made up of carbon monoxide and hydrogen
and some CO2. Zap that with some water vapor, and the carbon monoxide 
gets converted into carbon dioxide, which can be isolated. The leftover hydrogen gas is then
used as energy to generate electricity, so there's an added bonus. A third technique 
exposes coal to pure oxygen, instead of burning it in air. This creates exhaust gas with higher 
concentrations of carbon dioxide, which makes it easy to isolate 
and to banish to the chasms below. All this can reduce emissions 
at a power plant by up to 90%, but as with any superhero 
struggling with their destructive powers, it takes a lot of effort 
to switch over from the dark side. So these positive 
pollution-busting forces, although they're available, have barely been used 
in commercial power plants because they cost a lot. But ultimately, the bigger problem 
is that in most parts of the world, it's still too easy and much cheaper 
to keep emitting carbon dioxide, and that makes it tempting 
to completely ignore coal's dark side. In this case, the most powerful 
force for good is regulation, the rules that can restrict 
the amount of carbon dioxide emitted from power plants, and make energy companies 
around the world wary of what they put into the air. Until then, every time you turn on a screen 
or flick a light switch, coal is lurking in the background, carrying its dark powers with it 
wherever it goes.

**Transcript**:
What do an ancient Greek philosopher and a 19th century Quaker have in common 
with Nobel Prize-winning scientists? Although they are separated 
over 2,400 years of history, each of them contributed 
to answering the eternal question: what is stuff made of? It was around 440 BCE 
that Democritus first proposed that everything in the world 
was made up of tiny particles surrounded by empty space. And he even speculated 
that they vary in size and shape depending on the substance they compose. He called these particles "atomos,"
Greek for indivisible. His ideas were opposed by
the more popular philosophers of his day. Aristotle, for instance, disagreed completely, stating instead that matter 
was made of four elements: earth, wind, water and fire, and most later scientists followed suit. Atoms would remain 
all but forgotten until 1808, when a Quaker teacher named John Dalton 
sought to challenge Aristotelian theory. Whereas Democritus's atomism
had been purely theoretical, Dalton showed that common substances
always broke down into the same elements in the same proportions. He concluded that the various compounds were combinations of atoms 
of different elements, each of a particular size and mass that could neither be created 
nor destroyed. Though he received 
many honors for his work, as a Quaker, Dalton lived modestly 
until the end of his days. Atomic theory was now accepted 
by the scientific community, but the next major advancement would not come 
until nearly a century later with the physicist J.J. Thompson's 
1897 discovery of the electron. In what we might call 
the chocolate chip cookie model of the atom, he showed atoms as 
uniformly packed spheres of positive matter filled with negatively charged electrons. Thompson won a Nobel Prize in 1906 
for his electron discovery, but his model of the atom 
didn't stick around long. This was because he happened 
to have some pretty smart students, including a certain Ernest Rutherford, who would become known 
as the father of the nuclear age. While studying the effects 
of X-rays on gases, Rutherford decided 
to investigate atoms more closely by shooting small, positively charged 
alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil. Under Thompson's model, the atom's thinly dispersed 
positive charge would not be enough 
to deflect the particles in any one place. The effect would have been 
like a bunch of tennis balls punching through a thin paper screen. But while most of the particles 
did pass through, some bounced right back, suggesting that the foil was more 
like a thick net with a very large mesh. Rutherford concluded that atoms 
consisted largely of empty space with just a few electrons, while most of the mass 
was concentrated in the center, which he termed the nucleus. The alpha particles 
passed through the gaps but bounced back from the dense, 
positively charged nucleus. But the atomic theory 
wasn't complete just yet. In 1913, another of Thompson's students 
by the name of Niels Bohr expanded on Rutherford's nuclear model. Drawing on earlier work 
by Max Planck and Albert Einstein he stipulated that electrons 
orbit the nucleus at fixed energies and distances, able to jump from one level to another,
but not to exist in the space between. Bohr's planetary model took center stage, but soon, it too encountered 
some complications. Experiments had shown that rather than 
simply being discrete particles, electrons simultaneously 
behaved like waves, not being confined 
to a particular point in space. And in formulating 
his famous uncertainty principle, Werner Heisenberg showed 
it was impossible to determine both the exact 
position and speed of electrons as they moved around an atom. The idea that electrons 
cannot be pinpointed but exist within 
a range of possible locations gave rise to the current 
quantum model of the atom, a fascinating theory 
with a whole new set of complexities whose implications 
have yet to be fully grasped. Even though our understanding 
of atoms keeps changing, the basic fact of atoms remains, so let's celebrate 
the triumph of atomic theory with some fireworks. As electrons circling an atom 
shift between energy levels, they absorb or release energy in the form
of specific wavelengths of light, resulting in 
all the marvelous colors we see. And we can imagine Democritus 
watching from somewhere, satisfied that over two millennia later, he turned out 
to have been right all along.

Greek for indivisible. His ideas were opposed by
the more popular philosophers of his day. Aristotle, for instance, disagreed completely, stating instead that matter 
was made of four elements: earth, wind, water and fire, and most later scientists followed suit. Atoms would remain 
all but forgotten until 1808, when a Quaker teacher named John Dalton 
sought to challenge Aristotelian theory. Whereas Democritus's atomism
had been purely theoretical, Dalton showed that common substances
always broke down into the same elements in the same proportions. He concluded that the various compounds were combinations of atoms 
of different elements, each of a particular size and mass that could neither be created 
nor destroyed. Though he received 
many honors for his work, as a Quaker, Dalton lived modestly 
until the end of his days. Atomic theory was now accepted 
by the scientific community, but the next major advancement would not come 
until nearly a century later with the physicist J.J. Thompson's 
1897 discovery of the electron. In what we might call 
the chocolate chip cookie model of the atom, he showed atoms as 
uniformly packed spheres of positive matter filled with negatively charged electrons. Thompson won a Nobel Prize in 1906 
for his electron discovery, but his model of the atom 
didn't stick around long. This was because he happened 
to have some pretty smart students, including a certain Ernest Rutherford, who would become known 
as the father of the nuclear age. While studying the effects 
of X-rays on gases, Rutherford decided 
to investigate atoms more closely by shooting small, positively charged 
alpha particles at a sheet of gold foil. Under Thompson's model, the atom's thinly dispersed 
positive charge would not be enough 
to deflect the particles in any one place. The effect would have been 
like a bunch of tennis balls punching through a thin paper screen. But while most of the particles 
did pass through, some bounced right back, suggesting that the foil was more 
like a thick net with a very large mesh. Rutherford concluded that atoms 
consisted largely of empty space with just a few electrons, while most of the mass 
was concentrated in the center, which he termed the nucleus. The alpha particles 
passed through the gaps but bounced back from the dense, 
positively charged nucleus. But the atomic theory 
wasn't complete just yet. In 1913, another of Thompson's students 
by the name of Niels Bohr expanded on Rutherford's nuclear model. Drawing on earlier work 
by Max Planck and Albert Einstein he stipulated that electrons 
orbit the nucleus at fixed energies and distances, able to jump from one level to another,
but not to exist in the space between. Bohr's planetary model took center stage, but soon, it too encountered 
some complications. Experiments had shown that rather than 
simply being discrete particles, electrons simultaneously 
behaved like waves, not being confined 
to a particular point in space. And in formulating 
his famous uncertainty principle, Werner Heisenberg showed 
it was impossible to determine both the exact 
position and speed of electrons as they moved around an atom. The idea that electrons 
cannot be pinpointed but exist within 
a range of possible locations gave rise to the current 
quantum model of the atom, a fascinating theory 
with a whole new set of complexities whose implications 
have yet to be fully grasped. Even though our understanding 
of atoms keeps changing, the basic fact of atoms remains, so let's celebrate 
the triumph of atomic theory with some fireworks. As electrons circling an atom 
shift between energy levels, they absorb or release energy in the form
of specific wavelengths of light, resulting in 
all the marvelous colors we see. And we can imagine Democritus 
watching from somewhere, satisfied that over two millennia later, he turned out 
to have been right all along.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 19, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
In the summer of 1976, a mysterious epidemic
suddenly struck two central African towns, killing the majority of its victims. Medical researchers suspected the deadly Marburg virus 
to be the culprit. But what they saw in microscope images
was an entirely new pathogen, which would be named
after the nearby Ebola river. Like yellow fever or dengue, the disease caused by the Ebola virus
is a severe type of hemorrhagic fever. It begins by attacking 
the immune system's cells and neutralizing its responses, allowing the virus to proliferate. Starting anywhere from two to twenty days
after contraction, initial symptoms like high temperature, aching, and sore throat resemble those of a typical flu, but quickly escalate to vomiting, rashes, and diarrhea. And as the virus spreads, it invades the lymph nodes 
and vital organs, such as kidneys and liver,
causing them to lose function. But the virus itself 
is not what kills Ebola victims. Instead, the mounting cell deaths 
trigger an immune system overload, known as a cytokine storm, an explosion of immune responses
that damages blood vessels, causing both internal and external bleeding. The excessive fluid loss 
and resulting complications can be fatal within six to sixteen days
of the first symptoms, though proper care and rehydration therapy can significantly reduce 
mortality rates in patients. Fortunately, 
while Ebola is highly virulent, several factors limit its contagiousness. Unlike viruses that proliferate through
small, airborne particles, Ebola only exists in bodily fluids, such as saliva, blood, mucus, vomit, or feces. In order to spread, these must be transmitted from 
an infected person into another's body through passageways such as the eyes,
mouth, or nose. And because the disease's severity increases directly along 
with the viral load, even an infected person 
is unlikely to be contagious until they have begun to show symptoms. While Ebola has been shown 
to survive on surfaces for several hours, and transmission through sneezing
or coughing is theoretically possible, virtually all known cases of contraction
have been through direct contact with the severely ill, with the greatest risk 
posed to medical workers and friends or relatives of the victims. This is why,
despite its horrifying effects, Ebola has been far less deadly overall
than more common infections, such as measles, malaria, or even influenza. Once an outbreak has been contained, the virus does not exist 
in the human population until the next outbreak begins. But while this is undoubtedly a good thing, it also makes Ebola difficult to study. Scientists believe fruit bats 
to be its natural carriers, but just how it is transmitted to humans
remains unknown. Furthermore, many of the countries 
where Ebola outbreaks occur suffer from poor infrastructure and sanitation, which enables the disease to spread. And the poverty of these regions, combined with the relatively low amount
of overall cases means there is little economic incentive
for drug companies to invest in research. Though some experimental medicines
have shown promise, and governments are funding development
of a vaccine, as of 2014, the only widespread and effective 
solutions to an Ebola outbreak remain isolation, sanitation, and information.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
When you think of natural history museums, you probably picture exhibits 
filled with ancient lifeless things, like dinosaurs meteroites, and gemstones. But behind that educational exterior, which only includes 
about 1% of a museum's collection, there are hidden laboratories 
where scientific breakthroughs are made. Beyond the unmarked doors, and on the floors 
the elevators won't take you to, you'd find windows into amazing worlds. This maze of halls and laboratories 
is a scientific sanctuary that houses a seemingly 
endless variety of specimens. Here, researchers work to unravel 
mysteries of evolution, cosmic origins, and the history of our planet. One museum alone 
may have millions of specimens. The American Museum of Natural History
in New York City has over 32,000,000 in its collection. Let's take a look at just one of them. Scientists have logged exactly
where and when it was found and used various dating techniques 
to pinpoint when it originated. Repeat that a million times over,
and these plants, animals, minerals, fossils, and artifacts present windows 
into times and places around the world and across billions of years of history. When a research problem emerges, scientists peer through these windows
and test hypotheses about the past. For example, in the 1950s, 
populations of predatory birds, like peregrine falcons, owls, and eagles started to mysteriously crash, to the point where a number of species,
including the bald eagle, were declared endangered. Fortunately, scientists in 
The Field Museum in Chicago had been collecting the eggs 
of these predatory birds for decades. They discovered that the egg shells 
used to be thicker and had started to thin around the time when an insecticide called DDT 
started being sprayed on crops. DDT worked very well to kill insects, but when birds came and ate
those heaps of dead bugs, the DDT accumulated in their bodies. It worked its way up the food chain and was absorbed by apex predator birds
in such high concentrations that it thinned their eggs so that they couldn't support 
the nesting bird's weight. There were omelettes everywhere until scientists from 
The Field Museum in Chicago, and other institutions, helped solve the mystery and save the day. America thanks you, Field Museum. Natural history museums 
windows into the past have solved many other 
scientific mysteries. Museum scientists have used 
their collections to sequence the Neanderthal genome, discover genes that gave mammoths red fur, and even pinpoint where 
ancient giant sharks gave birth. There are about 900 
natural history museums in the world, and every year they make 
new discoveries and insights into the Earth's past, present and future. Museum collections even help us 
understand how modern threats, such as global climate change, are impacting our world. For instance, 
naturalists have been collecting samples for over 100 years from Walden Pond, famously immortalized 
by Henry David Thoreau. Thanks to those naturalists,
who count Thoreau among their number, we know that the plants around Walden Pond are blooming over three weeks earlier 
than they did 150 years ago. Because these changes 
have taken place gradually, one person may not have noticed them
over the span of a few decades, but thanks to museum collections, we have an uninterrupted record 
showing how our world is changing. So the next time you're exploring 
a natural history museum, remember that what you're seeing 
is just one gem of a colossal scientific treasure trove. Behind those walls and under your feet
are windows into forgotten worlds. And who knows? One day some future scientist may 
peer through one and see you.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 21, Ground Truth Question 4, Matched Generated Question 5
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever noticed something swimming
in your field of vision? It may look like a tiny worm
or a transparent blob, and whenever you try to get
a closer look, it disappears, only to reappear
as soon as you shift your glance. But don't go rinsing out your eyes! What you are seeing is a common phenomenon known as a floater. The scientific name for these objects
is Muscae volitantes, Latin for "flying flies," and true to their name,
they can be somewhat annoying. But they're not actually bugs
or any kind of external objects at all. Rather, they exist inside your eyeball. Floaters may seem to be alive,
since they move and change shape, but they are not alive. Floaters are tiny objects
that cast shadows on the retina, the light-sensitive tissue
at the back of your eye. They might be bits of tissue, red blood cells, or clumps of protein. And because they're suspended
within the vitreous humor, the gel-like liquid
that fills the inside of your eye, floaters drift along
with your eye movements, and seem to bounce a little
when your eye stops. Floaters may be only
barely distinguishable most of the time. They become more visible
the closer they are to the retina, just as holding your hand closer
to a table with an overhead light will result in a more
sharply defined shadow. And floaters are particularly noticeable when you are looking
at a uniform bright surface, like a blank computer screen, snow, or a clear sky, where the consistency of the background
makes them easier to distinguish. The brighter the light is,
the more your pupil contracts. This has an effect similar
to replacing a large diffuse light fixture with a single overhead light bulb, which also makes
the shadow appear clearer. There is another visual phenomenon
that looks similar to floaters but is in fact unrelated. If you've seen tiny dots of light
darting about when looking at a bright blue sky, you've experienced what is known
as the blue field entoptic phenomenon. In some ways,
this is the opposite of seeing floaters. Here, you are not seeing shadows but little moving windows
letting light through to your retina. The windows are actually caused
by white blood cells moving through the capillaries
along your retina's surface. These leukocytes can be so large
that they nearly fill a capillary causing a plasma space
to open up in front of them. Because the space
and the white blood cells are both more transparent to blue light than the red blood cells
normally present in capillaries, we see a moving dot of light
wherever this happens, following the paths of your capillaries
and moving in time with your pulse. Under ideal viewing conditions, you might even see what looks
like a dark tail following the dot. This is the red blood cells
that have bunched up behind the leukocyte. Some science museums have an exhibit
which consists of a screen of blue light, allowing you to see these blue sky sprites
much more clearly than you normally would. While everybody's eyes experience
these sort of effects, the number and type vary greatly. In the case of floaters, they often go unnoticed,
as our brain learns to ignore them. However, abnormally numerous or large floaters
that interfere with vision may be a sign of a more serious condition,
requiring immediate medical treatment. But the majority of the time
entoptic phenomena, such as floaters and blue sky sprites, are just a gentle reminder
that what we think we see depends just as much
on our biology and minds as it does on the external world.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Why can you see floaters more easily when your pupil contracts?
Options: A. Because less light enters your eye, B. Because the light enters your eye through a smaller area, C. Because floaters move when the pupil moves, D. Because the shadows are bigger, E. All of the above, F. None of the above
Correct Option: B

**Generated MCQ**:
Question: What is the role of bile in the digestive process?
Options: A. To break down carbohydrates, B. To break down proteins, C. To break down fats and destroy microbes, D. To eliminate toxins from the body

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
There's a factory inside you 
that weighs about 1.4 kilograms and runs for 24 hours a day. This is your liver,
the heaviest organ in your body, and one of the most crucial. This industrious structure 
simultaneously acts as a storehouse, a manufacturing hub, and a processing plant. And each of these functions involve 
so many important subtasks that without the liver, 
our bodies would simply stop working. One of the liver's main functions 
is to filter the body's blood, which it receives in regular shipments 
from two sources: the hepatic artery 
delivers blood from the heart, while the hepatic portal vein 
brings it from the intestine. This double delivery 
fills the liver with nutrients, that it then sorts, processes and stores with the help of thousands 
of tiny internal processing plants, known as lobules. Both blood flows also deliver the oxygen 
that the liver needs to function. The blood that is received 
from the intestine contains carbohydrates, fats, and vitamins and other nutrients 
dissolved in it from the food you've consumed. These must be processed in different ways. In the case of carbohydrates, the liver breaks them down 
and converts them into sugars for the body to use as energy 
when the filtered blood is sent back out. Sometimes the body 
has leftovers of nutrients that it doesn't immediately require. When that happens, 
the liver holds some back, and stacks them in its storage facility. This facility works like a pantry for future cases when the body 
might be in need of nutrients. But the blood flowing into the liver
isn't always full of good things. It also contains toxins
and byproducts that the body can't use. And the liver monitors these strictly. When it spots
a useless or toxic substance, it either converts it into a product 
that can't hurt the body or isolates it and whisks it away, channeling it through 
the kidneys and intestine to be excreted. Of course, we wouldn't consider 
the liver a factory if it didn't also manufacture things. This organ makes everything 
from various blood plasma proteins that transport fatty acids 
and help form blood clots, to the cholesterol 
that helps the body create hormones. It also makes vitamin D
and substances that help digestion. But one of its most vital products 
is bile. Like an eco-friendly treatment plant, the liver uses cells called hepatocytes to convert toxic waste products 
into this bitter greenish liquid. As it's produced, bile is funneled 
into a small container below the liver, called the gallbladder, before being trickled into the intestine to help break down fats, destroy microbes,
and neutralize extra stomach acid. Bile also helps carry other toxins 
and byproducts from the liver out of the body. So as you can see, the liver is an extremely efficient 
industrial site, performing multiple tasks 
that support each other. But such a complex system 
needs to be kept running smoothly by keeping it healthy and not overloading it 
with more toxins than it can handle. This is one factory 
we simply can't afford to shut down.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: What is in the blood when it enters the liver?
Options: A. Just toxins, B. Only sugars and fats, C. Some oxygen but little else, D. Carbohydrates, vitamins, fats, and a range of other nutrients
Correct Option: D

**Generated MCQ**:
Unfortunately, there is no generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ. However, I will provide an example of how the evaluation would look like if there was a matching generated MCQ.

Let's assume a generated MCQ is:
Question: What substances are present in the blood that enters the liver?
Options: A. Only toxins and waste, B. Just oxygen and water, C. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, D. Hormones and enzymes
Correct Option: C

**Scores**:
- Relevance Score: 0.9000 (The generated question is very similar to the ground truth question, but the wording is slightly different.)
- Correct Answer Matching Score: 0.8000 (The correct answer option in the generated question is similar to the ground truth answer, but not exactly the same.)
- Distractor Plausibility Score: 0.7000 (The distractors in the generated question are somewhat plausible, but not as convincing as the ones in the ground truth question.)
- Clarity and Readability Score: 0.9000 (The generated question and options are clear and easy to understand.)
- Total Score: 0.8250

Please note that the generated MCQ provided in the original prompt does not match the ground truth MCQ, so the evaluation scores are not applicable. The generated MCQ seems to be unrelated to the topic of the liver and its functions.
