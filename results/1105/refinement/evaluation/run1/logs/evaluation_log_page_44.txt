Trees are some of the 
biggest organisms on the planet, but where do they get that matter to grow? Man: Rich nutrients out the ground. Man: Start with soil or in the air. Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose. Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil? Man: Yeah... Derek Muller: Yeah... Derek Muller: Goodness. Man: Goodness. Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole 
around the tree where it's taking out all the soil? Man (right): 'Cause it does it so 
gradually that the soil is time to recover. Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots
digging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean
a tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not. In the early 1600 a scientist 
named Johann Baptist Van Helmholt tried to figure out where the mass
of a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully 
measured the amount of soil in there. Then he planted the tree and  
took care of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot . At the end of this experiment he was weighted the tree 
to find that it was 72 kilograms but the massive soil had
only decreased by about 60 grams. This was pretty strong evidence that the
mass of the tree does not come from the soil. I've never thought about that actually
because they don't really eat anything, trees. They don't eat anything?
--No. They don't eat anything? Water, it's all basically absorbed.
--That's all they eat? Yeah.
--They don't eat anything else? No.
--That's all they eat. Well presumably from the water 
and the nutrients from the soil. Is there anything else that you need 
besides the soil and the water? I suppose that's all you need, isn't it? To make--
--Other than the original seed for that particular tree, I suppose. The seed, the soil, and the water and
that makes this big tree. Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt
did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water. Now while that's not correct 
at least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree 
doesn't  come out of the soil. The sun energy, yeah. The sun energy?
--Yeah. Are they converting energy into mass or--? Do you know what I mean?
--Yeah. Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was. Where did that stuff come from? Magic. [laughing]
I have no idea. My question is where do they 
get that mass to grow big? Sun. Get it from the rain and the sun presuably. Light.
--Sunlight. The sunshine.
The sunshine? Does the sunshine add mass to the tree? It would need sunshine to grow. Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.
I don't know whether it adds mass, but they wouldn't go without it. Of course the sun's energy is needed for
the tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself
the energy is not matter. Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well. There's got to be something, you know. What is it about the air?
--A gas in the air that it needs as well. Oxygen.
The trees need the oxygen? And I guess oxygen. The oxygen, of course. The oxygen? Are there any ingredients that we're missing? Carbon dioxide. Would it surprise you to find out that 95% 
of a tree is actually from carbon dioxide. Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah.
--Surprising. I need this reaction like, "Oh holy sh-- [laughing] So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe
out carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances
 that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system 
where it's just you and a tree. You would breathe out that carbon
dioxide and water the tree would take it in. So you would get smaller 
while the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. However, I can tell you that the generated MCQs seem to be related to music and guitar, whereas the ground truth MCQ is related to the composition of a tree.

If I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure, I would say that Question 3 is the closest match, but the content is completely different.

To provide a more accurate answer, I would need generated MCQs that are related to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

However, if I had to choose an index, I would say that the index of the most similar generated MCQ is: None of the above.

But if you insist on having an index, I can tell you that the format of Question 3 is the closest match, so the index would be: 3.

Please note that this is not a correct match, and I would need more relevant generated MCQs to provide an accurate answer.

the tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself
the energy is not matter. Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well. There's got to be something, you know. What is it about the air?
--A gas in the air that it needs as well. Oxygen.
The trees need the oxygen? And I guess oxygen. The oxygen, of course. The oxygen? Are there any ingredients that we're missing? Carbon dioxide. Would it surprise you to find out that 95% 
of a tree is actually from carbon dioxide. Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah.
--Surprising. I need this reaction like, "Oh holy sh-- [laughing] So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe
out carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances
 that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system 
where it's just you and a tree. You would breathe out that carbon
dioxide and water the tree would take it in. So you would get smaller 
while the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree.

**Transcript**:
Trees are some of the 
biggest organisms on the planet, but where do they get that matter to grow? Man: Rich nutrients out the ground. Man: Start with soil or in the air. Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose. Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil? Man: Yeah... Derek Muller: Yeah... Derek Muller: Goodness. Man: Goodness. Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole 
around the tree where it's taking out all the soil? Man (right): 'Cause it does it so 
gradually that the soil is time to recover. Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots
digging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean
a tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not. In the early 1600 a scientist 
named Johann Baptist Van Helmholt tried to figure out where the mass
of a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully 
measured the amount of soil in there. Then he planted the tree and  
took care of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot . At the end of this experiment he was weighted the tree 
to find that it was 72 kilograms but the massive soil had
only decreased by about 60 grams. This was pretty strong evidence that the
mass of the tree does not come from the soil. I've never thought about that actually
because they don't really eat anything, trees. They don't eat anything?
--No. They don't eat anything? Water, it's all basically absorbed.
--That's all they eat? Yeah.
--They don't eat anything else? No.
--That's all they eat. Well presumably from the water 
and the nutrients from the soil. Is there anything else that you need 
besides the soil and the water? I suppose that's all you need, isn't it? To make--
--Other than the original seed for that particular tree, I suppose. The seed, the soil, and the water and
that makes this big tree. Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt
did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water. Now while that's not correct 
at least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree 
doesn't  come out of the soil. The sun energy, yeah. The sun energy?
--Yeah. Are they converting energy into mass or--? Do you know what I mean?
--Yeah. Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was. Where did that stuff come from? Magic. [laughing]
I have no idea. My question is where do they 
get that mass to grow big? Sun. Get it from the rain and the sun presuably. Light.
--Sunlight. The sunshine.

The sunshine? Does the sunshine add mass to the tree? It would need sunshine to grow. Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.
I don't know whether it adds mass, but they wouldn't go without it. Of course the sun's energy is needed for
the tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself
the energy is not matter. Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well. There's got to be something, you know. What is it about the air?
--A gas in the air that it needs as well. Oxygen.
The trees need the oxygen? And I guess oxygen. The oxygen, of course. The oxygen? Are there any ingredients that we're missing? Carbon dioxide. Would it surprise you to find out that 95% 
of a tree is actually from carbon dioxide. Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah.
--Surprising. I need this reaction like, "Oh holy sh-- [laughing] So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe
out carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances
 that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system 
where it's just you and a tree. You would breathe out that carbon
dioxide and water the tree would take it in. So you would get smaller 
while the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content.

To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Hendrix, Cobain and Page. They can all shred, but how exactly do the iconic 
contraptions in their hands produce notes, rhythm, melody and music. When you pluck a guitar string, you create
a vibration called a standing wave. Some points on the string, called nodes,
don't move at all, while other points, anti-nodes, 
oscillate back and forth. The vibration translates through the neck
and bridge to the guitar's body, where the thin and flexible wood vibrates, jostling the surrounding air molecules
together and apart. These sequential compressions
create sound waves, and the ones inside the guitar
mostly escape through the hole. They eventually propagate to your ear, which translates them into
electrical impulses that your brain interprets as sound. The pitch of that sound depends on
the frequency of the compressions. A quickly vibrating string will cause
a lot of compressions close together, making a high-pitched sound, and a slow vibration 
produces a low-pitched sound. Four things affect the frequency
of a vibrating string: the length, the tension,
the density and the thickness. Typical guitar strings 
are all the same length, and have similar tension,
but vary in thickness and density. Thicker strings vibrate more slowly,
producing lower notes. Each time you pluck a string, you actually create 
several standing waves. There's the first fundamental wave,
which determines the pitch of the note, but there are also waves
called overtones, whose frequencies 
are multiples of the first one. All these standing waves combine
to form a complex wave with a rich sound. Changing the way you pluck the string
affects which overtones you get. If you pluck it near the middle, you get mainly the fundamental
and the odd multiple overtones, which have anti-nodes
in the middle of the string. If you pluck it near the bridge,
you get mainly even multiple overtones and a twangier sound. The familiar Western scale is based on
the overtone series of a vibrating string. When we hear one note played with another
that has exactly twice its frequency, its first overtone, they sound so harmonious
that we assign them the same letter, and define the difference between them
as an octave. The rest of the scale 
is squeezed into that octave divided into twelve half steps whose frequency is each 2^(1/12)
higher than the one before. That factor determines the fret spacing. Each fret divides the string's
remaining length by 2^(1/12), making the frequencies 
increase by half steps. Fretless instruments, like violins, make it easier to produce the infinite
frequencies between each note, but add to the challenge 
of playing intune. The number of strings and their tuning are custom tailored 
to the chords we like to play and the physiology of our hands. Guitar shapes and materials can also vary, and both change the nature 
and sound of the vibrations. Playing two or more 
strings at the same time allows you to create new wave patterns
like chords and other sound effects. For example, when you play two notes
whose frequencies are close together, they add together to create a sound wave
whose amplitude rises and falls, producing a throbbing effect,
which guitarists call the beats. And electric guitars give you 
even more to play with. The vibrations still start in the strings, but then they're translated 
into electrical signals by pickups and transmitted to speakers 
that create the sound waves. Between the pickups and speakers, it's possible to process 
the wave in various ways, to create effects like distortion,
overdrive, wah-wah, delay and flanger. And lest you think that the physics 
of music is only useful for entertainment, consider this. Some physicists think that everything
in the universe is created by the harmonic series
of very tiny, very tense strings. So might our entire reality be the extended solo 
of some cosmic Jimi Hendrix? Clearly, there's a lot more to strings
than meets the ear.

and sound of the vibrations. Playing two or more 
strings at the same time allows you to create new wave patterns
like chords and other sound effects. For example, when you play two notes
whose frequencies are close together, they add together to create a sound wave
whose amplitude rises and falls, producing a throbbing effect,
which guitarists call the beats. And electric guitars give you 
even more to play with. The vibrations still start in the strings, but then they're translated 
into electrical signals by pickups and transmitted to speakers 
that create the sound waves. Between the pickups and speakers, it's possible to process 
the wave in various ways, to create effects like distortion,
overdrive, wah-wah, delay and flanger. And lest you think that the physics 
of music is only useful for entertainment, consider this. Some physicists think that everything
in the universe is created by the harmonic series
of very tiny, very tense strings. So might our entire reality be the extended solo 
of some cosmic Jimi Hendrix? Clearly, there's a lot more to strings
than meets the ear.

**Transcript**:
Hendrix, Cobain and Page. They can all shred, but how exactly do the iconic 
contraptions in their hands produce notes, rhythm, melody and music. When you pluck a guitar string, you create
a vibration called a standing wave. Some points on the string, called nodes,
don't move at all, while other points, anti-nodes, 
oscillate back and forth. The vibration translates through the neck
and bridge to the guitar's body, where the thin and flexible wood vibrates, jostling the surrounding air molecules
together and apart. These sequential compressions
create sound waves, and the ones inside the guitar
mostly escape through the hole. They eventually propagate to your ear, which translates them into
electrical impulses that your brain interprets as sound. The pitch of that sound depends on
the frequency of the compressions. A quickly vibrating string will cause
a lot of compressions close together, making a high-pitched sound, and a slow vibration 
produces a low-pitched sound. Four things affect the frequency
of a vibrating string: the length, the tension,
the density and the thickness. Typical guitar strings 
are all the same length, and have similar tension,
but vary in thickness and density. Thicker strings vibrate more slowly,
producing lower notes. Each time you pluck a string, you actually create 
several standing waves. There's the first fundamental wave,
which determines the pitch of the note, but there are also waves
called overtones, whose frequencies 
are multiples of the first one. All these standing waves combine
to form a complex wave with a rich sound. Changing the way you pluck the string
affects which overtones you get. If you pluck it near the middle, you get mainly the fundamental
and the odd multiple overtones, which have anti-nodes
in the middle of the string. If you pluck it near the bridge,
you get mainly even multiple overtones and a twangier sound. The familiar Western scale is based on
the overtone series of a vibrating string. When we hear one note played with another
that has exactly twice its frequency, its first overtone, they sound so harmonious
that we assign them the same letter, and define the difference between them
as an octave. The rest of the scale 
is squeezed into that octave divided into twelve half steps whose frequency is each 2^(1/12)
higher than the one before. That factor determines the fret spacing. Each fret divides the string's
remaining length by 2^(1/12), making the frequencies 
increase by half steps. Fretless instruments, like violins, make it easier to produce the infinite
frequencies between each note, but add to the challenge 
of playing intune. The number of strings and their tuning are custom tailored 
to the chords we like to play and the physiology of our hands. Guitar shapes and materials can also vary, and both change the nature 
and sound of the vibrations. Playing two or more 
strings at the same time allows you to create new wave patterns
like chords and other sound effects. For example, when you play two notes
whose frequencies are close together, they add together to create a sound wave

To understand what's happening with Greece
and the Eurozone, think about a dinner party. If you're cooking just for yourself and your
spouse, it's easy: you make something you both like. But if you've got guests, things
get harder. If you need to accommodate a vegetarian, and someone who is gluten free, and someone
with a soy allergy, your options get really limited. And that's the problem with Europe's
idea of having a whole bunch of countries all use the same currency. So Greece's economy
is in a disaster. A quarter of the population is unemployed, and it has this very high debt
burden. Normally, if you've got really high unemployment, what happens is that a country
makes its currency cheaper by printing extra money. That makes its products cheaper on
world markets, it makes it a more attractive tourist destination, and it means that foreign
investors can get great bargains. But if unemployment is really low, a country likes to have an
expensive currency. That increases people's purchasing power and it keeps prices down.
And in Europe, you have a bunch of economies that are really different. A price of Euros
that's appropriate for Greece, where they have a 25% unemployment rate is way too low
for Germany, where the unemployment rate is below 5%. And Greece's problem is that it's
small, poor, and geographically isolated from the rest of the Eurozone. It's like the only
vegetarian at a barbeque, except when it comes to currencies, there's no side dishes. And
so there's plenty of specific decisions we can second-guess, plenty of things Greece
did and various banks did that we can question, but fundamentally having all these countries
come to a dinner party with only one dish on the menu was a mistake. The euro was a
project that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their
determination to have peace on the continent, but they didn't really take the economics
of it seriously. So Greece joins the euro in 2001 and initially, it works out great
for Greece because all of a sudden everyone was like 'yeah, sure, let's lend them money.'
So they borrowed lots and lots and lots of euros, except that didn't change the fact
that their economy is a lot weaker than some of the other European countries. So to really
work, you would need a much, much, much closer union, where you had big financial transfers
coming from the richer places to the poorer places all the time. In the United States,
the poor states like Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, they're constantly getting money
from the richer states like Massachusetts, California, New York, through the welfare
system, through Social Security, through Medicare, through Medicaid. And you know, people may
complain about this or that program, but we don't dispute the idea that it's all one country
so money is going to circulate around. Europeans, you know, they just don't feel that way. Germans
are willing to support poor German people, but they don't want to support Greek people
with their tax dollars. So they're kind of like half-way integrated in a way that doesn't
really work.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as the story of the Ship of Theseus, and do not address the economic concepts discussed in the transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 8 is the most similar, but only because it talks about similarity, not because it is actually similar.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that addresses the economic concepts discussed in the transcript, such as the challenges of a single currency, the impact of economic differences between countries, and the potential solutions to these problems.

If I were to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be something like:

Question: According to the narrator, one possible way to address the economic challenges faced by Greece is:
Options: A. For Greece to leave the Eurozone, B. For Germany and other rich nations to provide financial assistance to Greece, C. For the European Central Bank to print more money, D. For Greece to implement austerity measures.

Correct Option: B.

**Transcript**:
To understand what's happening with Greece
and the Eurozone, think about a dinner party. If you're cooking just for yourself and your
spouse, it's easy: you make something you both like. But if you've got guests, things
get harder. If you need to accommodate a vegetarian, and someone who is gluten free, and someone
with a soy allergy, your options get really limited. And that's the problem with Europe's
idea of having a whole bunch of countries all use the same currency. So Greece's economy
is in a disaster. A quarter of the population is unemployed, and it has this very high debt
burden. Normally, if you've got really high unemployment, what happens is that a country
makes its currency cheaper by printing extra money. That makes its products cheaper on
world markets, it makes it a more attractive tourist destination, and it means that foreign
investors can get great bargains. But if unemployment is really low, a country likes to have an
expensive currency. That increases people's purchasing power and it keeps prices down.
And in Europe, you have a bunch of economies that are really different. A price of Euros
that's appropriate for Greece, where they have a 25% unemployment rate is way too low
for Germany, where the unemployment rate is below 5%. And Greece's problem is that it's
small, poor, and geographically isolated from the rest of the Eurozone. It's like the only
vegetarian at a barbeque, except when it comes to currencies, there's no side dishes. And
so there's plenty of specific decisions we can second-guess, plenty of things Greece
did and various banks did that we can question, but fundamentally having all these countries
come to a dinner party with only one dish on the menu was a mistake. The euro was a
project that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their
determination to have peace on the continent, but they didn't really take the economics
of it seriously. So Greece joins the euro in 2001 and initially, it works out great
for Greece because all of a sudden everyone was like 'yeah, sure, let's lend them money.'
So they borrowed lots and lots and lots of euros, except that didn't change the fact
that their economy is a lot weaker than some of the other European countries. So to really
work, you would need a much, much, much closer union, where you had big financial transfers
coming from the richer places to the poorer places all the time. In the United States,
the poor states like Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, they're constantly getting money
from the richer states like Massachusetts, California, New York, through the welfare
system, through Social Security, through Medicare, through Medicaid. And you know, people may
complain about this or that program, but we don't dispute the idea that it's all one country
so money is going to circulate around. Europeans, you know, they just don't feel that way. Germans
are willing to support poor German people, but they don't want to support Greek people
with their tax dollars. So they're kind of like half-way integrated in a way that doesn't
really work.

**Transcript**:
To understand what's happening with Greece
and the Eurozone, think about a dinner party. If you're cooking just for yourself and your
spouse, it's easy: you make something you both like. But if you've got guests, things
get harder. If you need to accommodate a vegetarian, and someone who is gluten free, and someone
with a soy allergy, your options get really limited. And that's the problem with Europe's
idea of having a whole bunch of countries all use the same currency. So Greece's economy
is in a disaster. A quarter of the population is unemployed, and it has this very high debt
burden. Normally, if you've got really high unemployment, what happens is that a country
makes its currency cheaper by printing extra money. That makes its products cheaper on
world markets, it makes it a more attractive tourist destination, and it means that foreign
investors can get great bargains. But if unemployment is really low, a country likes to have an
expensive currency. That increases people's purchasing power and it keeps prices down.
And in Europe, you have a bunch of economies that are really different. A price of Euros
that's appropriate for Greece, where they have a 25% unemployment rate is way too low
for Germany, where the unemployment rate is below 5%. And Greece's problem is that it's
small, poor, and geographically isolated from the rest of the Eurozone. It's like the only
vegetarian at a barbeque, except when it comes to currencies, there's no side dishes. And
so there's plenty of specific decisions we can second-guess, plenty of things Greece
did and various banks did that we can question, but fundamentally having all these countries
come to a dinner party with only one dish on the menu was a mistake. The euro was a
project that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their
determination to have peace on the continent, but they didn't really take the economics
of it seriously. So Greece joins the euro in 2001 and initially, it works out great
for Greece because all of a sudden everyone was like 'yeah, sure, let's lend them money.'
So they borrowed lots and lots and lots of euros, except that didn't change the fact
that their economy is a lot weaker than some of the other European countries. So to really
work, you would need a much, much, much closer union, where you had big financial transfers
coming from the richer places to the poorer places all the time. In the United States,
the poor states like Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, they're constantly getting money
from the richer states like Massachusetts, California, New York, through the welfare
system, through Social Security, through Medicare, through Medicaid. And you know, people may
complain about this or that program, but we don't dispute the idea that it's all one country
so money is going to circulate around. Europeans, you know, they just don't feel that way. Germans
are willing to support poor German people, but they don't want to support Greek people
with their tax dollars. So they're kind of like half-way integrated in a way that doesn't
really work.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs seem to be related to a different topic, such as the story of the Ship of Theseus, and do not address the economic concepts discussed in the transcript.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the available options, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. But if I had to pick one, I would say Question 8 is the most similar, but only because it talks about similarity, not because it is actually similar.

A more suitable generated MCQ would be one that addresses the economic concepts discussed in the transcript, such as the challenges of a single currency, the impact of economic differences between countries, and the potential solutions to these problems.

If I were to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ, it would be something like:

Question: According to the narrator, one possible way to address the economic challenges faced by Greece is:
Options: A. For Greece to leave the Eurozone, B. For Germany and other rich nations to provide financial assistance to Greece, C. For the European Central Bank to print more money, D. For Greece to implement austerity measures.

Correct Option: B.

This generated MCQ is more similar to the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

**Transcript**:
Throughout the history of mankind, three little words have sent poets
to the blank page, philosophers to the Agora, and seekers to the oracles: "Who am I?" From the ancient Greek aphorism
inscribed on the Temple of Apollo, "Know thyself," to The Who's rock anthem, "Who Are You?" philosophers, psychologists, academics, scientists, artists,
theologians and politicians have all tackled the subject of identity. Their hypotheses are widely varied
and lack significant consensus. These are smart, creative people, so what's so hard about coming up
with the right answer? One challenge certainly lies with the complex concept 
of the persistence of identity. Which you is who? The person you are today? Five years ago? Who you'll be in 50 years? And when is "am"? This week? Today? This hour? This second? And which aspect of you is "I"? Are you your physical body? Your thoughts and feelings? Your actions? These murky waters of abstract logic
are tricky to navigate, and so it's probably fitting
that to demonstrate the complexity, the Greek historian Plutarch
used the story of a ship. How are you "I"? As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical
founder King of Athens, single-handedly slayed 
the evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship. To honor this heroic feat, for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly
maintained his ship in the harbor, and annually reenacted his voyage. Whenever a part of the ship
was worn or damaged, it was replaced with an identical piece
of the same material until, at some point, 
no original parts remained. Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus was an example 
of the philosophical paradox revolving around 
the persistence of identity. How can every single part 
of something be replaced, yet it still remains the same thing? Let's imagine there are two ships: the ship that Theseus 
docked in Athens, Ship A, and the ship sailed by the Athenians
1000 years later, Ship B. Very simply, our question is this:
does A equal B? Some would say that for 1000 years
there has been only one Ship of Theseus, and because the changes made to it
happened gradually, it never at any point in time
stopped being the legendary ship. Though they have absolutely 
no parts in common, the two ships are numerically identical,
meaning one and the same, so A equals B. However, others could argue
that Theseus never set foot on Ship B, and his presence on the ship
is an essential qualitative property of the Ship of Theseus. It cannot survive without him. So, though the two ships 
are numerically identical, they are not qualitatively identical. Thus, A does not equal B. But what happens 
when we consider this twist? What if, as each piece 
of the original ship was cast off, somebody collected them all,
and rebuilt the entire original ship? When it was finished, undeniably
two physical ships would exist: the one that's docked in Athens, and the one in some guy's backyard. Each could lay claim to the title,
"The Ship of Theseus," but only would could actually
be the real thing. So which one is it, and more importantly, 
what does this have to do with you? Like the Ship of Theseus, you are a collection of constantly
changing parts: your physical body, mind, emotions,
circumstances, and even your quirks, always changing, but still in an amazing
and sometimes illogical way, you stay the same, too. This is one of the reasons that 
the question, "Who am I?" is so complex. And in order to answer it, like so many great minds before you, you must be willing to dive into the
bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox. Or maybe you could just answer, "I am a legendary hero sailing 
a powerful ship on an epic journey." That could work, too.

are tricky to navigate, and so it's probably fitting
that to demonstrate the complexity, the Greek historian Plutarch
used the story of a ship. How are you "I"? As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical
founder King of Athens, single-handedly slayed 
the evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship. To honor this heroic feat, for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly
maintained his ship in the harbor, and annually reenacted his voyage. Whenever a part of the ship
was worn or damaged, it was replaced with an identical piece
of the same material until, at some point, 
no original parts remained. Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus was an example 
of the philosophical paradox revolving around 
the persistence of identity. How can every single part 
of something be replaced, yet it still remains the same thing? Let's imagine there are two ships: the ship that Theseus 
docked in Athens, Ship A, and the ship sailed by the Athenians
1000 years later, Ship B. Very simply, our question is this:
does A equal B? Some would say that for 1000 years
there has been only one Ship of Theseus, and because the changes made to it
happened gradually, it never at any point in time
stopped being the legendary ship. Though they have absolutely 
no parts in common, the two ships are numerically identical,
meaning one and the same, so A equals B. However, others could argue
that Theseus never set foot on Ship B, and his presence on the ship
is an essential qualitative property of the Ship of Theseus. It cannot survive without him. So, though the two ships 
are numerically identical, they are not qualitatively identical. Thus, A does not equal B. But what happens 
when we consider this twist? What if, as each piece 
of the original ship was cast off, somebody collected them all,
and rebuilt the entire original ship? When it was finished, undeniably
two physical ships would exist: the one that's docked in Athens, and the one in some guy's backyard. Each could lay claim to the title,
"The Ship of Theseus," but only would could actually
be the real thing. So which one is it, and more importantly, 
what does this have to do with you? Like the Ship of Theseus, you are a collection of constantly
changing parts: your physical body, mind, emotions,
circumstances, and even your quirks, always changing, but still in an amazing
and sometimes illogical way, you stay the same, too. This is one of the reasons that 
the question, "Who am I?" is so complex. And in order to answer it, like so many great minds before you, you must be willing to dive into the
bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox. Or maybe you could just answer, "I am a legendary hero sailing 
a powerful ship on an epic journey." That could work, too.

**Transcript**:
You're swimming in the ocean
when something brushes your leg. When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung 
by a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous
creatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft 
because they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent 
gel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing
stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, 
the size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like
tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped
with a bell at the top and descending tentacles 
around the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,
the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend 
more than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain 
most of the stinging cells, although some species have them
on their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under 
high osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli
activate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open
and sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed
harpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject 
venom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur
in less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest
biomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue
to fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove
lingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render
undischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help 
remove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water
because any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure 
outside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area,
a common folk remedy, may do more harm that good,
depending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings 
are a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly,
also called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause
contraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom,
but the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate 
medical intervention. Despite the impressive power
in their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match
for the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle
and ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations
that prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines 
in the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth 
behind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae
can cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve
their own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies
as moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles
without ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs
covered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses
by eating the cnidocytes and transferring them 
to specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit
from the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating
cnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size
of a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out 
in the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second 
to marvel at its wonders.

**Transcript**:
You're swimming in the ocean
when something brushes your leg. When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung 
by a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous
creatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft 
because they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent 
gel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing
stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, 
the size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like
tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped
with a bell at the top and descending tentacles 
around the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,
the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend 
more than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain 
most of the stinging cells, although some species have them
on their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under 
high osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli
activate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open
and sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed
harpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject 
venom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur
in less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest

**Transcript**:
Has anyone ever told you,
"Stand up straight!" or scolded you for slouching
at a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying,
but they're not wrong. Your posture, the way you hold your body
when you're sitting or standing, is the foundation for every movement
your body makes, and can determine how well your body
adapts to the stresses on it. These stresses can be things 
like carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position. And the big one we all experience 
all day every day: gravity. If your posture isn't optimal, your muscles have to work harder
to keep you upright and balanced. Some muscles will become tight
and inflexbile. Others will be inhibited. Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair your body's ability 
to deal with the forces on it. Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear
on your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, 
like your lungs, less efficient. Researchers have linked 
poor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive 
cause of any of them. Posture can even influence 
your emotional state and your sensitivity to pain. So there are a lot of reasons
to aim for good posture. But it's getting harder these days. Sitting in an awkward position 
for a long time can promote poor posture, and so can using computers 
or mobile devices, which encourage you to look downward. Many studies suggest that, on average,
posture is getting worse. So what does good posture look like? When you look at the spine 
from the front or the back, all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked
in a straight line. From the side, the spine
should have three curves: one at your neck, one at your shoulders,
and one at the small of your back. You aren't born with this s-shaped spine. Babies' spines just have one curve like a "c." The other curves usually develop
by 12-18 months as the muscles strengthen. These curves help us stay upright
and absorb some of the stress from activities like walking and jumping. If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front 
of your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle. This keeps your center of gravity
directly over your base of support, which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue
and muscle strain. If you're sitting, 
your neck should be vertical, not tilted forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed
with your arms close to your trunk. Your knees should be at a right angle
with your feet flat on the floor. But what if your posture isn't that great? Try redesigning your environment. Adjust your screen so it's at
or slightly below eyelevel. Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, 
are supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to. Try sleeping on your side
with your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs. Wear shoes with low heels
and good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls. It's also not enough 
to just have good posture. Keeping your muscles and joints moving
is extremely important. In fact, being stationary for long periods
with good posture can be worse than regular movement
with bad posture. When you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you're carrying
close to your body. Backpacks should be in contact 
with your back carried symetrically. If you sit a lot, get up and move around
on occassion, and be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them
strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits 
to your joints, bones, brain and heart. And if you're really worried,
check with a physical therapist, because yes, 
you really should stand up straight.

Match Phase - Ground Truth Set 11, Question 4
Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Has anyone ever told you,
"Stand up straight!" or scolded you for slouching
at a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying,
but they're not wrong. Your posture, the way you hold your body
when you're sitting or standing, is the foundation for every movement
your body makes, and can determine how well your body
adapts to the stresses on it. These stresses can be things 
like carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position. And the big one we all experience 
all day every day: gravity. If your posture isn't optimal, your muscles have to work harder
to keep you upright and balanced. Some muscles will become tight
and inflexbile. Others will be inhibited. Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair your body's ability 
to deal with the forces on it. Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear
on your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, 
like your lungs, less efficient. Researchers have linked 
poor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive 
cause of any of them. Posture can even influence 
your emotional state and your sensitivity to pain. So there are a lot of reasons
to aim for good posture. But it's getting harder these days. Sitting in an awkward position 
for a long time can promote poor posture, and so can using computers 
or mobile devices, which encourage you to look downward. Many studies suggest that, on average,
posture is getting worse. So what does good posture look like? When you look at the spine 
from the front or the back, all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked
in a straight line. From the side, the spine
should have three curves: one at your neck, one at your shoulders,
and one at the small of your back. You aren't born with this s-shaped spine. Babies' spines just have one curve like a "c." The other curves usually develop
by 12-18 months as the muscles strengthen. These curves help us stay upright
and absorb some of the stress from activities like walking and jumping. If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front 
of your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle. This keeps your center of gravity
directly over your base of support, which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue
and muscle strain. If you're sitting, 
your neck should be vertical, not tilted forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed
with your arms close to your trunk. Your knees should be at a right angle
with your feet flat on the floor. But what if your posture isn't that great? Try redesigning your environment. Adjust your screen so it's at
or slightly below eyelevel. Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, 
are supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to. Try sleeping on your side
with your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs. Wear shoes with low heels
and good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls. It's also not enough 
to just have good posture. Keeping your muscles and joints moving
is extremely important. In fact, being stationary for long periods
with good posture can be worse than regular movement
with bad posture. When you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you're carrying
close to your body. Backpacks should be in contact 
with your back carried symetrically. If you sit a lot, get up and move around
on occassion, and be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them
strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits 
to your joints, bones, brain and heart. And if you're really worried,
check with a physical therapist, because yes, 
you really should stand up straight.

Have you ever seen static electricity
cause a spark of light? What is that spark? What about lightning, the Northern Lights, or the tail of a comet? All of those things, and many others, in fact 99.9% of the universe,
are made of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter drastically different 
from the more familiar forms. Take ice, for example. Ice, a solid, 
melts to become water, a liquid, which, when heated, 
vaporizes into steam, a gas. Continued heating of the steam
at a high enough temperature causes the water molecules 
in it to separate into freely roaming hydrogen 
and oxygen atoms. With a little more heat,
the ionization process occurs and the negatively charged electrons
escape the atoms, leaving behind positively charged ions. This mixture of freely roaming negative
and positive charges is plasma, and at a high enough temperature,
any gas can be made into one. These freely moving charged particles
behave very differently from the particles 
in other types of matter. When a doorknob, a solid,
has static electricity on it, it doesn't look or behave any differently. And with the exception of a compass
or other magnetic object, we rarely see matter 
respond to a magnetic field. But put a plasma in an electric field
or magnetic field, and you'll get a very different reaction. Because plasmas are charged, electric fields accelerate them, and magnetic fields steer them
in circular orbits. And when the particles 
within plasma collide, or accelerated 
by electricity or magnetism, light is generated, which is what we see 
when we look at plasmas like the Aurora Borealis. Plasmas aren't just beautiful,
celestial phenomena, though. Imagine a tiny cube made of normal gas
with a very high voltage across it. The resulting electric field pushes some of the electrons off the atoms
and accelerates them to high speeds causing the ionization of other atoms. Imbedded impurities 
in the tiny cube of gas cause it to gain and release 
a precise amount of energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation. Attached to each tiny cube, a fluorescent material glows
with a specific color when ultraviolet light 
at just the right intensity reaches it. Now, make a rectangle 
out of a million of these tiny cubes, each separately controlled
by sophisticated electronics. You may be looking at one now. This is called a plasma TV. Plasmas also have implications
for health care. Plasma chemists create 
highly specific plasmas that can destroy 
or alter targeted chemicals, thereby killing pathogenic organisms
on food or hospital surfaces. Plasmas are all around us, in forms that are both spectacular
and practical. And in the future, plasma could be used to permanently rid 
landfills of their waste, efficiently remove toxins 
from our air and water, and provide us with a potentially
unlimited supply of renewable clean energy.

Matching Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript and a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), your task is to match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever seen static electricity
cause a spark of light? What is that spark? What about lightning, the Northern Lights, or the tail of a comet? All of those things, and many others, in fact 99.9% of the universe,
are made of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter drastically different 
from the more familiar forms. Take ice, for example. Ice, a solid, 
melts to become water, a liquid, which, when heated, 
vaporizes into steam, a gas. Continued heating of the steam
at a high enough temperature causes the water molecules 
in it to separate into freely roaming hydrogen 
and oxygen atoms. With a little more heat,
the ionization process occurs and the negatively charged electrons
escape the atoms, leaving behind positively charged ions. This mixture of freely roaming negative
and positive charges is plasma, and at a high enough temperature,
any gas can be made into one. These freely moving charged particles
behave very differently from the particles 
in other types of matter. When a doorknob, a solid,
has static electricity on it, it doesn't look or behave any differently. And with the exception of a compass
or other magnetic object, we rarely see matter 
respond to a magnetic field. But put a plasma in an electric field
or magnetic field, and you'll get a very different reaction. Because plasmas are charged, electric fields accelerate them, and magnetic fields steer them
in circular orbits. And when the particles 
within plasma collide, or accelerated 
by electricity or magnetism, light is generated, which is what we see 
when we look at plasmas like the Aurora Borealis. Plasmas aren't just beautiful,
celestial phenomena, though. Imagine a tiny cube made of normal gas
with a very high voltage across it. The resulting electric field pushes some of the electrons off the atoms
and accelerates them to high speeds causing the ionization of other atoms. Imbedded impurities 
in the tiny cube of gas cause it to gain and release 
a precise amount of energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation. Attached to each tiny cube, a fluorescent material glows
with a specific color when ultraviolet light 
at just the right intensity reaches it. Now, make a rectangle 
out of a million of these tiny cubes, each separately controlled
by sophisticated electronics. You may be looking at one now. This is called a plasma TV. Plasmas also have implications
for health care. Plasma chemists create 
highly specific plasmas that can destroy 
or alter targeted chemicals, thereby killing pathogenic organisms
on food or hospital surfaces. Plasmas are all around us, in forms that are both spectacular
and practical. And in the future, plasma could be used to permanently rid 
landfills of their waste, efficiently remove toxins 
from our air and water, and provide us with a potentially
unlimited supply of renewable clean energy.

**Transcript**:
Your dog loves to curl up on the couch,
but so do you, so you shoo him off
and settle in for a cozy evening. After all, you're the human around here. You're an intelligent being,
not a simple creature of instinct. You can plan and dream, and oh- Did your dog just outsmart you
and feel happy about it? Or was he just following his instincts? Is there even a difference? What is he thinking? Well, it depends on 
what we mean by "thinking" and the criteria we use to evaluate it. Aristotle and Descartes both use 
the criteria of instinct and intelligence to divide animals from humans. Aristotle believed 
that humans possess reason, while animals could only follow brute
instincts for survival and reproduction. Almost 2000 years later, Descartes suggested 
a more extreme version of that idea, arguing that animals following instincts
were indistinguishable from robots responding mechanically 
to stimuli in their environments. But the consensus against animal 
intelligence began to unravel with Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Darwin hypothesized that intelligence
could evolve from simpler instincts. He had observed earthworms making choices
about how to drag oddly shaped leaves into their boroughs, and was struck that a human might employ
similar means to solve a similar problem. And if, as he thought, humans 
are descended from simpler creatures, then perhaps our minds lie
at the far end of a continuum, differing from theirs in degree,
but not in kind. Recent experiments showing that many
species can solve complex problems confirm Darwin's initial hypothesis. Elephants use objects to reach
inaccessible places. Crows make their own tools, and can use water displacement 
to get a reward. Octopuses can open jars 
after watching others do so, and can even remember 
the process months later. Such tasks involve considering 
aspects of a problem separately from the immediate situation,
and retaining the strategy for later use. Still, while animals 
can solve complex problems, how do we know what, or even that, 
they are thinking? Behaviorists, such as Pavlov
and Thorndike, argue that animals that appear to think are usually only responding 
to reward or punishment. This was the case with Clever Hans, a horse with the amazing ability
to tap out answers to math problems. But it turns out Hans 
wasn't especially good at math, but at reading his unwitting 
trainer's subtle nonverbal cues for when to stop tapping. So Hans couldn't count,
but does that mean he wasn't thinking? After all, he could interpret 
nuanced social messages, a quality he shared with many other
non-human animals. Elephants recognize each other
after years apart, and even seem to mourn their dead. Bees communicate 
using a special waggle dance to indicate the location and quality 
of a food source to other bees. Chimpanzees engage 
in complex deception schemes, suggesting not only do they think,
but they understand that others do, too. And then there is Alex the Grey Parrot, who could use human language to distinguish the colors 
and shapes of absent objects, and even understand abstract concepts,
like bigger and smaller. That sounds a lot like intelligence, and not just the work 
of mindless machines. But while a non-human animal can solve
problems and even communicate, for humans, thinking 
also involves consciousness, the ability to reflect on our actions,
not simply to perform them. So far, none of our studies tell us
if having the intelligence to outsmart us means that our dog 
can also feel good about doing so. What we really want to know is
what is it like to be a dog, or an octopus, or a crow? Philosophers of mind call this
The Hard Problem, because while you and I can report
what it feels like to be a human, nobody speaks horse. Even a talking parrot, like Alex, couldn't tell us how he feels 
about the colors he could name. And what if consciousness 
comes in different forms? Would we even recognize 
the consciousness of bees? For that matter, how can we know for sure
that other people have consciouness? Perhaps they're just 
well-functioning zombies. Regardless, animal minds continue to test
the limits of our understanding and how we frame them may reveal more
about our minds than theirs.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Options: A. Instinct, B. Intelligence, C. Tool use, D. A & B, E. B & C, F. C & D

**Transcript**:
Your dog loves to curl up on the couch,
but so do you, so you shoo him off
and settle in for a cozy evening. After all, you're the human around here. You're an intelligent being,
not a simple creature of instinct. You can plan and dream, and oh- Did your dog just outsmart you
and feel happy about it? Or was he just following his instincts? Is there even a difference? What is he thinking? Well, it depends on 
what we mean by "thinking" and the criteria we use to evaluate it. Aristotle and Descartes both use 
the criteria of instinct and intelligence to divide animals from humans. Aristotle believed 
that humans possess reason, while animals could only follow brute
instincts for survival and reproduction. Almost 2000 years later, Descartes suggested 
a more extreme version of that idea, arguing that animals following instincts
were indistinguishable from robots responding mechanically 
to stimuli in their environments. But the consensus against animal 
intelligence began to unravel with Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Darwin hypothesized that intelligence
could evolve from simpler instincts. He had observed earthworms making choices
about how to drag oddly shaped leaves into their boroughs, and was struck that a human might employ
similar means to solve a similar problem. And if, as he thought, humans 
are descended from simpler creatures, then perhaps our minds lie
at the far end of a continuum, differing from theirs in degree,
but not in kind. Recent experiments showing that many
species can solve complex problems confirm Darwin's initial hypothesis. Elephants use objects to reach
inaccessible places. Crows make their own tools, and can use water displacement 
to get a reward. Octopuses can open jars 
after watching others do so, and can even remember 
the process months later. Such tasks involve considering 
aspects of a problem separately from the immediate situation,
and retaining the strategy for later use. Still, while animals 
can solve complex problems, how do we know what, or even that, 
they are thinking? Behaviorists, such as Pavlov
and Thorndike, argue that animals that appear to think are usually only responding 
to reward or punishment. This was the case with Clever Hans, a horse with the amazing ability
to tap out answers to math problems. But it turns out Hans 
wasn't especially good at math, but at reading his unwitting 
trainer's subtle nonverbal cues for when to stop tapping. So Hans couldn't count,
but does that mean he wasn't thinking? After all, he could interpret 
nuanced social messages, a quality he shared with many other
non-human animals. Elephants recognize each other
after years apart, and even seem to mourn their dead. Bees communicate

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Consciousness--the ability to reflect on or experience one's own actions--is sometimes called the "hard problem" among philosophers of mind. Why is the "hard problem" so hard?
Options: A. Because we can't observe what is like to experience the world from the perspective of a nonhuman being, B. Because nonhuman animals don't feel anything, C. Because the ability to reflect on one's actions is limited to humans, D. Because only parrots and horses have learned to communicate their thoughts to humans, E. Because consciousness comes only in one form

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly

helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up

you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting

But if you want me to choose one, I would say Question 5 is the most similar in terms of format, but not in terms of content.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

Matching Response:
After analyzing the ground truth MCQ and the generated MCQs, I found that none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

The ground truth MCQ is about Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy, specifically about how we see "the absurdity of the world." The generated MCQs, on the other hand, are about cholera prevention and treatment, which is a completely different topic.

Therefore, I couldn't find a generated MCQ that closely matches the ground truth MCQ. If I had to provide an index, I would say that there is no match, or the index is "None."

However, if you'd like, I can try to generate a new MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. Please let me know!

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore

Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living

a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
Unfortunately, none of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content. The generated MCQs appear to be related to cholera prevention and treatment, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the novel "Nausea" by Jean-Paul Sartre.

However, if I had to choose the most similar generated MCQ based on the format and structure of the question, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ.

But if you want me to choose one, I would say that Question 8 is the most similar in terms of format, but not in terms of content or intent.

Index: 8 (Please note that this is a very weak match and not a recommended match)

It would be best to generate new MCQs that are relevant to the topic of the ground truth MCQ.

Please identify the generated MCQ that most closely matches the ground truth MCQ, based on question intent, options, and content.
Provide the index of the most similar generated MCQ.

Matching Response:
None of the generated MCQs match the ground truth MCQ. The generated MCQs appear to be related to cholera prevention and treatment, whereas the ground truth MCQ is about the concept of "bad faith" in the context of Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophy.

If I had to choose, I would say that none of the generated MCQs are similar to the ground truth MCQ. However, I can suggest that a new generated MCQ that matches the ground truth MCQ could be created. Here is an example:

Question: What does Jean-Paul Sartre mean by "bad faith"?
Options: A. Living without taking freedom properly on board; telling ourselves that things have to be a certain way, shutting our eyes to other options., B. Failing to worship a deity with the full piousness and devotion they deserve, C. Breaking promises to others frequently, thus creating a chain reaction of broken trust in society, D. Refusing to help others because of our belief that they deserve their bad conditions
Correct Option: A

This new generated MCQ matches the ground truth MCQ in terms of question intent, options, and content.

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Trees are some of the 
biggest organisms on the planet, but where do they get that matter to grow? Man: Rich nutrients out the ground. Man: Start with soil or in the air. Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose. Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil? Man: Yeah... Derek Muller: Yeah... Derek Muller: Goodness. Man: Goodness. Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole 
around the tree where it's taking out all the soil? Man (right): 'Cause it does it so 
gradually that the soil is time to recover. Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots
digging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean
a tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not. In the early 1600 a scientist 
named Johann Baptist Van Helmholt tried to figure out where the mass
of a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully 
measured the amount of soil in there. Then he planted the tree and  
took care of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot . At the end of this experiment he was weighted the tree 
to find that it was 72 kilograms but the massive soil had
only decreased by about 60 grams. This was pretty strong evidence that the
mass of the tree does not come from the soil. I've never thought about that actually
because they don't really eat anything, trees. They don't eat anything?
--No. They don't eat anything? Water, it's all basically absorbed.
--That's all they eat? Yeah.
--They don't eat anything else? No.
--That's all they eat. Well presumably from the water 
and the nutrients from the soil. Is there anything else that you need 
besides the soil and the water? I suppose that's all you need, isn't it? To make--
--Other than the original seed for that particular tree, I suppose. The seed, the soil, and the water and
that makes this big tree. Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt
did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water. Now while that's not correct 
at least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree 
doesn't  come out of the soil. The sun energy, yeah. The sun energy?
--Yeah. Are they converting energy into mass or--? Do you know what I mean?
--Yeah. Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was. Where did that stuff come from? Magic. [laughing]
I have no idea. My question is where do they 
get that mass to grow big? Sun. Get it from the rain and the sun presuably. Light.
--Sunlight. The sunshine.
The sunshine? Does the sunshine add mass to the tree? It would need sunshine to grow. Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.
I don't know whether it adds mass, but they wouldn't go without it. Of course the sun's energy is needed for
the tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself
the energy is not matter. Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well. There's got to be something, you know. What is it about the air?
--A gas in the air that it needs as well. Oxygen.
The trees need the oxygen? And I guess oxygen. The oxygen, of course. The oxygen? Are there any ingredients that we're missing? Carbon dioxide. Would it surprise you to find out that 95% 
of a tree is actually from carbon dioxide. Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah.
--Surprising. I need this reaction like, "Oh holy sh-- [laughing] So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe
out carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances
 that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system 
where it's just you and a tree. You would breathe out that carbon
dioxide and water the tree would take it in. So you would get smaller 
while the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Trees are some of the 
biggest organisms on the planet, but where do they get that matter to grow? Man: Rich nutrients out the ground. Man: Start with soil or in the air. Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose. Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil? Man: Yeah... Derek Muller: Yeah... Derek Muller: Goodness. Man: Goodness. Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole 
around the tree where it's taking out all the soil? Man (right): 'Cause it does it so 
gradually that the soil is time to recover. Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots
digging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean
a tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not. In the early 1600 a scientist 
named Johann Baptist Van Helmholt tried to figure out where the mass
of a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully 
measured the amount of soil in there. Then he planted the tree and  
took care of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot . At the end of this experiment he was weighted the tree 
to find that it was 72 kilograms but the massive soil had
only decreased by about 60 grams. This was pretty strong evidence that the
mass of the tree does not come from the soil. I've never thought about that actually
because they don't really eat anything, trees. They don't eat anything?
--No. They don't eat anything? Water, it's all basically absorbed.
--That's all they eat? Yeah.
--They don't eat anything else? No.
--That's all they eat. Well presumably from the water 
and the nutrients from the soil. Is there anything else that you need 
besides the soil and the water? I suppose that's all you need, isn't it? To make--
--Other than the original seed for that particular tree, I suppose. The seed, the soil, and the water and
that makes this big tree. Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt
did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water. Now while that's not correct 
at least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree 
doesn't  come out of the soil. The sun energy, yeah. The sun energy?
--Yeah. Are they converting energy into mass or--? Do you know what I mean?
--Yeah. Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was. Where did that stuff come from? Magic. [laughing]
I have no idea. My question is where do they 
get that mass to grow big? Sun. Get it from the rain and the sun presuably. Light.
--Sunlight. The sunshine.
The sunshine? Does the sunshine add mass to the tree? It would need sunshine to grow. Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.
I don't know whether it adds mass, but they wouldn't go without it. Of course the sun's energy is needed for
the tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself
the energy is not matter. Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well. There's got to be something, you know. What is it about the air?
--A gas in the air that it needs as well. Oxygen.
The trees need the oxygen? And I guess oxygen. The oxygen, of course. The oxygen? Are there any ingredients that we're missing? Carbon dioxide. Would it surprise you to find out that 95% 
of a tree is actually from carbon dioxide. Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah.
--Surprising. I need this reaction like, "Oh holy sh-- [laughing] So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe
out carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances
 that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system 
where it's just you and a tree. You would breathe out that carbon
dioxide and water the tree would take it in. So you would get smaller 
while the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 5, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 6
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Hendrix, Cobain and Page. They can all shred, but how exactly do the iconic 
contraptions in their hands produce notes, rhythm, melody and music. When you pluck a guitar string, you create
a vibration called a standing wave. Some points on the string, called nodes,
don't move at all, while other points, anti-nodes, 
oscillate back and forth. The vibration translates through the neck
and bridge to the guitar's body, where the thin and flexible wood vibrates, jostling the surrounding air molecules
together and apart. These sequential compressions
create sound waves, and the ones inside the guitar
mostly escape through the hole. They eventually propagate to your ear, which translates them into
electrical impulses that your brain interprets as sound. The pitch of that sound depends on
the frequency of the compressions. A quickly vibrating string will cause
a lot of compressions close together, making a high-pitched sound, and a slow vibration 
produces a low-pitched sound. Four things affect the frequency
of a vibrating string: the length, the tension,
the density and the thickness. Typical guitar strings 
are all the same length, and have similar tension,
but vary in thickness and density. Thicker strings vibrate more slowly,
producing lower notes. Each time you pluck a string, you actually create 
several standing waves. There's the first fundamental wave,
which determines the pitch of the note, but there are also waves
called overtones, whose frequencies 
are multiples of the first one. All these standing waves combine
to form a complex wave with a rich sound. Changing the way you pluck the string
affects which overtones you get. If you pluck it near the middle, you get mainly the fundamental
and the odd multiple overtones, which have anti-nodes
in the middle of the string. If you pluck it near the bridge,
you get mainly even multiple overtones and a twangier sound. The familiar Western scale is based on
the overtone series of a vibrating string. When we hear one note played with another
that has exactly twice its frequency, its first overtone, they sound so harmonious
that we assign them the same letter, and define the difference between them
as an octave. The rest of the scale 
is squeezed into that octave divided into twelve half steps whose frequency is each 2^(1/12)
higher than the one before. That factor determines the fret spacing. Each fret divides the string's
remaining length by 2^(1/12), making the frequencies 
increase by half steps. Fretless instruments, like violins, make it easier to produce the infinite
frequencies between each note, but add to the challenge 
of playing intune. The number of strings and their tuning are custom tailored 
to the chords we like to play and the physiology of our hands. Guitar shapes and materials can also vary, and both change the nature 
and sound of the vibrations. Playing two or more 
strings at the same time allows you to create new wave patterns
like chords and other sound effects. For example, when you play two notes
whose frequencies are close together, they add together to create a sound wave
whose amplitude rises and falls, producing a throbbing effect,
which guitarists call the beats. And electric guitars give you 
even more to play with. The vibrations still start in the strings, but then they're translated 
into electrical signals by pickups and transmitted to speakers 
that create the sound waves. Between the pickups and speakers, it's possible to process 
the wave in various ways, to create effects like distortion,
overdrive, wah-wah, delay and flanger. And lest you think that the physics 
of music is only useful for entertainment, consider this. Some physicists think that everything
in the universe is created by the harmonic series
of very tiny, very tense strings. So might our entire reality be the extended solo 
of some cosmic Jimi Hendrix? Clearly, there's a lot more to strings
than meets the ear.

remaining length by 2^(1/12), making the frequencies 
increase by half steps. Fretless instruments, like violins, make it easier to produce the infinite
frequencies between each note, but add to the challenge 
of playing intune. The number of strings and their tuning are custom tailored 
to the chords we like to play and the physiology of our hands. Guitar shapes and materials can also vary, and both change the nature 
and sound of the vibrations. Playing two or more 
strings at the same time allows you to create new wave patterns
like chords and other sound effects. For example, when you play two notes
whose frequencies are close together, they add together to create a sound wave
whose amplitude rises and falls, producing a throbbing effect,
which guitarists call the beats. And electric guitars give you 
even more to play with. The vibrations still start in the strings, but then they're translated 
into electrical signals by pickups and transmitted to speakers 
that create the sound waves. Between the pickups and speakers, it's possible to process 
the wave in various ways, to create effects like distortion,
overdrive, wah-wah, delay and flanger. And lest you think that the physics 
of music is only useful for entertainment, consider this. Some physicists think that everything
in the universe is created by the harmonic series
of very tiny, very tense strings. So might our entire reality be the extended solo 
of some cosmic Jimi Hendrix? Clearly, there's a lot more to strings
than meets the ear.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
To understand what's happening with Greece
and the Eurozone, think about a dinner party. If you're cooking just for yourself and your
spouse, it's easy: you make something you both like. But if you've got guests, things
get harder. If you need to accommodate a vegetarian, and someone who is gluten free, and someone
with a soy allergy, your options get really limited. And that's the problem with Europe's
idea of having a whole bunch of countries all use the same currency. So Greece's economy
is in a disaster. A quarter of the population is unemployed, and it has this very high debt
burden. Normally, if you've got really high unemployment, what happens is that a country
makes its currency cheaper by printing extra money. That makes its products cheaper on
world markets, it makes it a more attractive tourist destination, and it means that foreign
investors can get great bargains. But if unemployment is really low, a country likes to have an
expensive currency. That increases people's purchasing power and it keeps prices down.
And in Europe, you have a bunch of economies that are really different. A price of Euros
that's appropriate for Greece, where they have a 25% unemployment rate is way too low
for Germany, where the unemployment rate is below 5%. And Greece's problem is that it's
small, poor, and geographically isolated from the rest of the Eurozone. It's like the only
vegetarian at a barbeque, except when it comes to currencies, there's no side dishes. And
so there's plenty of specific decisions we can second-guess, plenty of things Greece
did and various banks did that we can question, but fundamentally having all these countries
come to a dinner party with only one dish on the menu was a mistake. The euro was a
project that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their
determination to have peace on the continent, but they didn't really take the economics
of it seriously. So Greece joins the euro in 2001 and initially, it works out great
for Greece because all of a sudden everyone was like 'yeah, sure, let's lend them money.'
So they borrowed lots and lots and lots of euros, except that didn't change the fact
that their economy is a lot weaker than some of the other European countries. So to really
work, you would need a much, much, much closer union, where you had big financial transfers
coming from the richer places to the poorer places all the time. In the United States,
the poor states like Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, they're constantly getting money
from the richer states like Massachusetts, California, New York, through the welfare
system, through Social Security, through Medicare, through Medicaid. And you know, people may
complain about this or that program, but we don't dispute the idea that it's all one country
so money is going to circulate around. Europeans, you know, they just don't feel that way. Germans
are willing to support poor German people, but they don't want to support Greek people
with their tax dollars. So they're kind of like half-way integrated in a way that doesn't
really work.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: According to the narrator, one of the possible ways the problem can be solved is by:
Options: A. Rich countries giving aid to Germany, B. Having a single currency, C. Germany and other rich nations helping the Greeks, D. By printing more money

project that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their
determination to have peace on the continent, but they didn't really take the economics
of it seriously. So Greece joins the euro in 2001 and initially, it works out great
for Greece because all of a sudden everyone was like 'yeah, sure, let's lend them money.'
So they borrowed lots and lots and lots of euros, except that didn't change the fact
that their economy is a lot weaker than some of the other European countries. So to really
work, you would need a much, much, much closer union, where you had big financial transfers
coming from the richer places to the poorer places all the time. In the United States,
the poor states like Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, they're constantly getting money
from the richer states like Massachusetts, California, New York, through the welfare
system, through Social Security, through Medicare, through Medicaid. And you know, people may
complain about this or that program, but we don't dispute the idea that it's all one country
so money is going to circulate around. Europeans, you know, they just don't feel that way. Germans
are willing to support poor German people, but they don't want to support Greek people
with their tax dollars. So they're kind of like half-way integrated in a way that doesn't
really work.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 7, Ground Truth Question 6, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
To understand what's happening with Greece
and the Eurozone, think about a dinner party. If you're cooking just for yourself and your
spouse, it's easy: you make something you both like. But if you've got guests, things
get harder. If you need to accommodate a vegetarian, and someone who is gluten free, and someone
with a soy allergy, your options get really limited. And that's the problem with Europe's
idea of having a whole bunch of countries all use the same currency. So Greece's economy
is in a disaster. A quarter of the population is unemployed, and it has this very high debt
burden. Normally, if you've got really high unemployment, what happens is that a country
makes its currency cheaper by printing extra money. That makes its products cheaper on
world markets, it makes it a more attractive tourist destination, and it means that foreign
investors can get great bargains. But if unemployment is really low, a country likes to have an
expensive currency. That increases people's purchasing power and it keeps prices down.
And in Europe, you have a bunch of economies that are really different. A price of Euros
that's appropriate for Greece, where they have a 25% unemployment rate is way too low
for Germany, where the unemployment rate is below 5%. And Greece's problem is that it's
small, poor, and geographically isolated from the rest of the Eurozone. It's like the only
vegetarian at a barbeque, except when it comes to currencies, there's no side dishes. And
so there's plenty of specific decisions we can second-guess, plenty of things Greece
did and various banks did that we can question, but fundamentally having all these countries
come to a dinner party with only one dish on the menu was a mistake. The euro was a
project that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their

that's appropriate for Greece, where they have a 25% unemployment rate is way too low
for Germany, where the unemployment rate is below 5%. And Greece's problem is that it's
small, poor, and geographically isolated from the rest of the Eurozone. It's like the only
vegetarian at a barbeque, except when it comes to currencies, there's no side dishes. And
so there's plenty of specific decisions we can second-guess, plenty of things Greece
did and various banks did that we can question, but fundamentally having all these countries
come to a dinner party with only one dish on the menu was a mistake. The euro was a
project that Europe set about on for really political reasons. It was a symbol of their
determination to have peace on the continent, but they didn't really take the economics
of it seriously. So Greece joins the euro in 2001 and initially, it works out great
for Greece because all of a sudden everyone was like 'yeah, sure, let's lend them money.'
So they borrowed lots and lots and lots of euros, except that didn't change the fact
that their economy is a lot weaker than some of the other European countries. So to really
work, you would need a much, much, much closer union, where you had big financial transfers
coming from the richer places to the poorer places all the time. In the United States,
the poor states like Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, they're constantly getting money
from the richer states like Massachusetts, California, New York, through the welfare
system, through Social Security, through Medicare, through Medicaid. And you know, people may
complain about this or that program, but we don't dispute the idea that it's all one country
so money is going to circulate around. Europeans, you know, they just don't feel that way. Germans
are willing to support poor German people, but they don't want to support Greek people
with their tax dollars. So they're kind of like half-way integrated in a way that doesn't
really work.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 8, Ground Truth Question 1, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Throughout the history of mankind, three little words have sent poets
to the blank page, philosophers to the Agora, and seekers to the oracles: "Who am I?" From the ancient Greek aphorism
inscribed on the Temple of Apollo, "Know thyself," to The Who's rock anthem, "Who Are You?" philosophers, psychologists, academics, scientists, artists,
theologians and politicians have all tackled the subject of identity. Their hypotheses are widely varied
and lack significant consensus. These are smart, creative people, so what's so hard about coming up
with the right answer? One challenge certainly lies with the complex concept 
of the persistence of identity. Which you is who? The person you are today? Five years ago? Who you'll be in 50 years? And when is "am"? This week? Today? This hour? This second? And which aspect of you is "I"? Are you your physical body? Your thoughts and feelings? Your actions? These murky waters of abstract logic
are tricky to navigate, and so it's probably fitting
that to demonstrate the complexity, the Greek historian Plutarch
used the story of a ship. How are you "I"? As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical
founder King of Athens, single-handedly slayed 
the evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship. To honor this heroic feat, for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly
maintained his ship in the harbor, and annually reenacted his voyage. Whenever a part of the ship
was worn or damaged, it was replaced with an identical piece
of the same material until, at some point, 
no original parts remained. Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus was an example 
of the philosophical paradox revolving around 
the persistence of identity. How can every single part 
of something be replaced, yet it still remains the same thing? Let's imagine there are two ships: the ship that Theseus 
docked in Athens, Ship A, and the ship sailed by the Athenians
1000 years later, Ship B. Very simply, our question is this:
does A equal B? Some would say that for 1000 years
there has been only one Ship of Theseus, and because the changes made to it
happened gradually, it never at any point in time
stopped being the legendary ship. Though they have absolutely 
no parts in common, the two ships are numerically identical,
meaning one and the same, so A equals B. However, others could argue
that Theseus never set foot on Ship B, and his presence on the ship
is an essential qualitative property of the Ship of Theseus. It cannot survive without him. So, though the two ships 
are numerically identical, they are not qualitatively identical. Thus, A does not equal B. But what happens 
when we consider this twist? What if, as each piece 
of the original ship was cast off, somebody collected them all,
and rebuilt the entire original ship? When it was finished, undeniably
two physical ships would exist: the one that's docked in Athens, and the one in some guy's backyard. Each could lay claim to the title,
"The Ship of Theseus," but only would could actually
be the real thing. So which one is it, and more importantly, 
what does this have to do with you? Like the Ship of Theseus, you are a collection of constantly
changing parts: your physical body, mind, emotions,
circumstances, and even your quirks, always changing, but still in an amazing
and sometimes illogical way, you stay the same, too. This is one of the reasons that 
the question, "Who am I?" is so complex. And in order to answer it, like so many great minds before you, you must be willing to dive into the
bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox. Or maybe you could just answer, "I am a legendary hero sailing 
a powerful ship on an epic journey." That could work, too.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Throughout the history of mankind, three little words have sent poets
to the blank page, philosophers to the Agora, and seekers to the oracles: "Who am I?" From the ancient Greek aphorism
inscribed on the Temple of Apollo, "Know thyself," to The Who's rock anthem, "Who Are You?" philosophers, psychologists, academics, scientists, artists,
theologians and politicians have all tackled the subject of identity. Their hypotheses are widely varied
and lack significant consensus. These are smart, creative people, so what's so hard about coming up
with the right answer? One challenge certainly lies with the complex concept 
of the persistence of identity. Which you is who? The person you are today? Five years ago? Who you'll be in 50 years? And when is "am"? This week? Today? This hour? This second? And which aspect of you is "I"? Are you your physical body? Your thoughts and feelings? Your actions? These murky waters of abstract logic
are tricky to navigate, and so it's probably fitting
that to demonstrate the complexity, the Greek historian Plutarch
used the story of a ship. How are you "I"? As the tale goes, Theseus, the mythical
founder King of Athens, single-handedly slayed 
the evil Minotaur at Crete, then returned home on a ship. To honor this heroic feat, for 1000 years Athenians painstakingly
maintained his ship in the harbor, and annually reenacted his voyage. Whenever a part of the ship
was worn or damaged, it was replaced with an identical piece
of the same material until, at some point, 
no original parts remained. Plutarch noted the Ship of Theseus was an example 
of the philosophical paradox revolving around 
the persistence of identity. How can every single part 
of something be replaced, yet it still remains the same thing? Let's imagine there are two ships: the ship that Theseus 
docked in Athens, Ship A, and the ship sailed by the Athenians
1000 years later, Ship B. Very simply, our question is this:
does A equal B? Some would say that for 1000 years
there has been only one Ship of Theseus, and because the changes made to it
happened gradually, it never at any point in time
stopped being the legendary ship. Though they have absolutely 
no parts in common, the two ships are numerically identical,
meaning one and the same, so A equals B. However, others could argue
that Theseus never set foot on Ship B, and his presence on the ship
is an essential qualitative property of the Ship of Theseus. It cannot survive without him. So, though the two ships 
are numerically identical, they are not qualitatively identical. Thus, A does not equal B. But what happens 
when we consider this twist? What if, as each piece 
of the original ship was cast off, somebody collected them all,
and rebuilt the entire original ship? When it was finished, undeniably
two physical ships would exist: the one that's docked in Athens, and the one in some guy's backyard. Each could lay claim to the title,
"The Ship of Theseus," but only would could actually
be the real thing. So which one is it, and more importantly, 
what does this have to do with you? Like the Ship of Theseus, you are a collection of constantly
changing parts: your physical body, mind, emotions,
circumstances, and even your quirks, always changing, but still in an amazing
and sometimes illogical way, you stay the same, too. This is one of the reasons that 
the question, "Who am I?" is so complex. And in order to answer it, like so many great minds before you, you must be willing to dive into the
bottomless ocean of philosophical paradox. Or maybe you could just answer, "I am a legendary hero sailing 
a powerful ship on an epic journey." That could work, too.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:

**Transcript**:
You're swimming in the ocean
when something brushes your leg. When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung 
by a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous
creatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft 
because they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent 
gel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing
stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, 
the size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like
tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped
with a bell at the top and descending tentacles 
around the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,
the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend 
more than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain 
most of the stinging cells, although some species have them
on their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under 
high osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli
activate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open
and sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed
harpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject 
venom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur
in less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest
biomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue
to fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove
lingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render
undischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help 
remove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water
because any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure 
outside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area,
a common folk remedy, may do more harm that good,
depending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings 
are a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly,
also called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause
contraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom,
but the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate 
medical intervention. Despite the impressive power
in their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match
for the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle
and ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations
that prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines 
in the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth 
behind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae
can cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve
their own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies
as moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles
without ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs
covered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses
by eating the cnidocytes and transferring them 
to specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit
from the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating
cnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size
of a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out 
in the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second 
to marvel at its wonders.

Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
You're swimming in the ocean
when something brushes your leg. When the tingling sets in, you realize you've been stung 
by a jellyfish. How do these beautiful, gelatinous
creatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft 
because they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent 
gel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing
stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish, 
the size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like
tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped
with a bell at the top and descending tentacles 
around the margin. The largest species of jellyfish,
the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend 
more than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain 
most of the stinging cells, although some species have them
on their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under 
high osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli
activate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open
and sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed
harpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject 
venom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur
in less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest
biomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue
to fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove
lingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render
undischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help 
remove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water
because any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure 
outside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area,
a common folk remedy, may do more harm that good,
depending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings 
are a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly,
also called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause
contraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom,
but the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate 
medical intervention. Despite the impressive power
in their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match
for the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle
and ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations
that prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines 
in the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth 
behind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae
can cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve
their own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies
as moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles
without ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs
covered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses
by eating the cnidocytes and transferring them 
to specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit
from the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating
cnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size
of a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out 
in the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second 
to marvel at its wonders.

Evaluation Prompt:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Has anyone ever told you,
"Stand up straight!" or scolded you for slouching
at a family dinner? Comments like that might be annoying,
but they're not wrong. Your posture, the way you hold your body
when you're sitting or standing, is the foundation for every movement
your body makes, and can determine how well your body
adapts to the stresses on it. These stresses can be things 
like carrying weight, or sitting in an awkward position. And the big one we all experience 
all day every day: gravity. If your posture isn't optimal, your muscles have to work harder
to keep you upright and balanced. Some muscles will become tight
and inflexbile. Others will be inhibited. Over time, these dysfunctional adaptations impair your body's ability 
to deal with the forces on it. Poor posture inflicts extra wear and tear
on your joints and ligaments, increases the likelihood of accidents, and makes some organs, 
like your lungs, less efficient. Researchers have linked 
poor posture to scoliosis, tension headaches, and back pain, though it isn't the exclusive 
cause of any of them. Posture can even influence 
your emotional state and your sensitivity to pain. So there are a lot of reasons
to aim for good posture. But it's getting harder these days. Sitting in an awkward position 
for a long time can promote poor posture, and so can using computers 
or mobile devices, which encourage you to look downward. Many studies suggest that, on average,
posture is getting worse. So what does good posture look like? When you look at the spine 
from the front or the back, all 33 vertebrae should appear stacked
in a straight line. From the side, the spine
should have three curves: one at your neck, one at your shoulders,
and one at the small of your back. You aren't born with this s-shaped spine. Babies' spines just have one curve like a "c." The other curves usually develop
by 12-18 months as the muscles strengthen. These curves help us stay upright
and absorb some of the stress from activities like walking and jumping. If they are aligned properly, when you're standing up, you should be able to draw a straight line from a point just in front 
of your shoulders, to behind your hip, to the front of your knee, to a few inches in front of your ankle. This keeps your center of gravity
directly over your base of support, which allows you to move efficiently with the least amount of fatigue
and muscle strain. If you're sitting, 
your neck should be vertical, not tilted forward. Your shoulders should be relaxed
with your arms close to your trunk. Your knees should be at a right angle
with your feet flat on the floor. But what if your posture isn't that great? Try redesigning your environment. Adjust your screen so it's at
or slightly below eyelevel. Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, 
are supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to. Try sleeping on your side
with your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs. Wear shoes with low heels
and good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls. It's also not enough 
to just have good posture. Keeping your muscles and joints moving
is extremely important. In fact, being stationary for long periods
with good posture can be worse than regular movement
with bad posture. When you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you're carrying
close to your body. Backpacks should be in contact 
with your back carried symetrically. If you sit a lot, get up and move around
on occassion, and be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them
strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits 
to your joints, bones, brain and heart. And if you're really worried,
check with a physical therapist, because yes, 
you really should stand up straight.

or slightly below eyelevel. Make sure all parts of your body, like your elbows and wrists, 
are supported, using ergonomic aids if you need to. Try sleeping on your side
with your neck supported and with a pillow between your legs. Wear shoes with low heels
and good arch support, and use a headset for phone calls. It's also not enough 
to just have good posture. Keeping your muscles and joints moving
is extremely important. In fact, being stationary for long periods
with good posture can be worse than regular movement
with bad posture. When you do move, move smartly. Keep anything you're carrying
close to your body. Backpacks should be in contact 
with your back carried symetrically. If you sit a lot, get up and move around
on occassion, and be sure to exercise. Using your muscles will keep them
strong enough to support you effectively, on top of all the other benefits 
to your joints, bones, brain and heart. And if you're really worried,
check with a physical therapist, because yes, 
you really should stand up straight.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever seen static electricity
cause a spark of light? What is that spark? What about lightning, the Northern Lights, or the tail of a comet? All of those things, and many others, in fact 99.9% of the universe,
are made of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter drastically different 
from the more familiar forms. Take ice, for example. Ice, a solid, 
melts to become water, a liquid, which, when heated, 
vaporizes into steam, a gas. Continued heating of the steam
at a high enough temperature causes the water molecules 
in it to separate into freely roaming hydrogen 
and oxygen atoms. With a little more heat,
the ionization process occurs and the negatively charged electrons
escape the atoms, leaving behind positively charged ions. This mixture of freely roaming negative
and positive charges is plasma, and at a high enough temperature,
any gas can be made into one. These freely moving charged particles
behave very differently from the particles 
in other types of matter. When a doorknob, a solid,
has static electricity on it, it doesn't look or behave any differently. And with the exception of a compass
or other magnetic object, we rarely see matter 
respond to a magnetic field. But put a plasma in an electric field
or magnetic field, and you'll get a very different reaction. Because plasmas are charged, electric fields accelerate them, and magnetic fields steer them
in circular orbits. And when the particles 
within plasma collide, or accelerated 
by electricity or magnetism, light is generated, which is what we see 
when we look at plasmas like the Aurora Borealis. Plasmas aren't just beautiful,
celestial phenomena, though. Imagine a tiny cube made of normal gas
with a very high voltage across it. The resulting electric field pushes some of the electrons off the atoms
and accelerates them to high speeds causing the ionization of other atoms. Imbedded impurities 
in the tiny cube of gas cause it to gain and release 
a precise amount of energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation. Attached to each tiny cube, a fluorescent material glows
with a specific color when ultraviolet light 
at just the right intensity reaches it. Now, make a rectangle 
out of a million of these tiny cubes, each separately controlled
by sophisticated electronics. You may be looking at one now. This is called a plasma TV. Plasmas also have implications
for health care. Plasma chemists create 
highly specific plasmas that can destroy 
or alter targeted chemicals, thereby killing pathogenic organisms
on food or hospital surfaces. Plasmas are all around us, in forms that are both spectacular
and practical. And in the future, plasma could be used to permanently rid 
landfills of their waste, efficiently remove toxins 
from our air and water, and provide us with a potentially
unlimited supply of renewable clean energy.

in the tiny cube of gas cause it to gain and release 
a precise amount of energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation. Attached to each tiny cube, a fluorescent material glows
with a specific color when ultraviolet light 
at just the right intensity reaches it. Now, make a rectangle 
out of a million of these tiny cubes, each separately controlled
by sophisticated electronics. You may be looking at one now. This is called a plasma TV. Plasmas also have implications
for health care. Plasma chemists create 
highly specific plasmas that can destroy 
or alter targeted chemicals, thereby killing pathogenic organisms
on food or hospital surfaces. Plasmas are all around us, in forms that are both spectacular
and practical. And in the future, plasma could be used to permanently rid 
landfills of their waste, efficiently remove toxins 
from our air and water, and provide us with a potentially
unlimited supply of renewable clean energy.

Scoring Phase - Ground Truth Set 13, Ground Truth Question 5, Matched Generated Question 1
Evaluation Prompt:

You are an expert evaluator for educational content. Given a transcript, a set of ground truth multiple-choice questions (MCQs), and a set of generated MCQs, your task is to:

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Have you ever seen static electricity
cause a spark of light? What is that spark? What about lightning, the Northern Lights, or the tail of a comet? All of those things, and many others, in fact 99.9% of the universe,
are made of plasma. Plasma is a state of matter drastically different 
from the more familiar forms. Take ice, for example. Ice, a solid, 
melts to become water, a liquid, which, when heated, 
vaporizes into steam, a gas. Continued heating of the steam
at a high enough temperature causes the water molecules 
in it to separate into freely roaming hydrogen 
and oxygen atoms. With a little more heat,
the ionization process occurs and the negatively charged electrons
escape the atoms, leaving behind positively charged ions. This mixture of freely roaming negative
and positive charges is plasma, and at a high enough temperature,
any gas can be made into one. These freely moving charged particles
behave very differently from the particles 
in other types of matter. When a doorknob, a solid,
has static electricity on it, it doesn't look or behave any differently. And with the exception of a compass
or other magnetic object, we rarely see matter 
respond to a magnetic field. But put a plasma in an electric field
or magnetic field, and you'll get a very different reaction. Because plasmas are charged, electric fields accelerate them, and magnetic fields steer them
in circular orbits. And when the particles 
within plasma collide, or accelerated 
by electricity or magnetism, light is generated, which is what we see 
when we look at plasmas like the Aurora Borealis. Plasmas aren't just beautiful,
celestial phenomena, though. Imagine a tiny cube made of normal gas
with a very high voltage across it. The resulting electric field pushes some of the electrons off the atoms
and accelerates them to high speeds causing the ionization of other atoms. Imbedded impurities 
in the tiny cube of gas cause it to gain and release 
a precise amount of energy in the form of ultraviolet radiation. Attached to each tiny cube, a fluorescent material glows
with a specific color when ultraviolet light 
at just the right intensity reaches it. Now, make a rectangle 
out of a million of these tiny cubes, each separately controlled
by sophisticated electronics. You may be looking at one now. This is called a plasma TV. Plasmas also have implications

landfills of their waste, efficiently remove toxins 
from our air and water, and provide us with a potentially

**Transcript**:
Your dog loves to curl up on the couch,
but so do you, so you shoo him off
and settle in for a cozy evening. After all, you're the human around here. You're an intelligent being,
not a simple creature of instinct. You can plan and dream, and oh- Did your dog just outsmart you
and feel happy about it? Or was he just following his instincts? Is there even a difference? What is he thinking? Well, it depends on 
what we mean by "thinking" and the criteria we use to evaluate it. Aristotle and Descartes both use 
the criteria of instinct and intelligence to divide animals from humans. Aristotle believed 
that humans possess reason, while animals could only follow brute
instincts for survival and reproduction. Almost 2000 years later, Descartes suggested 
a more extreme version of that idea, arguing that animals following instincts
were indistinguishable from robots responding mechanically 
to stimuli in their environments. But the consensus against animal 
intelligence began to unravel with Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Darwin hypothesized that intelligence
could evolve from simpler instincts. He had observed earthworms making choices
about how to drag oddly shaped leaves into their boroughs, and was struck that a human might employ
similar means to solve a similar problem. And if, as he thought, humans 
are descended from simpler creatures, then perhaps our minds lie
at the far end of a continuum, differing from theirs in degree,
but not in kind. Recent experiments showing that many
species can solve complex problems confirm Darwin's initial hypothesis. Elephants use objects to reach
inaccessible places. Crows make their own tools, and can use water displacement 
to get a reward. Octopuses can open jars 
after watching others do so, and can even remember 
the process months later. Such tasks involve considering 
aspects of a problem separately from the immediate situation,
and retaining the strategy for later use. Still, while animals 
can solve complex problems, how do we know what, or even that, 
they are thinking? Behaviorists, such as Pavlov
and Thorndike, argue that animals that appear to think are usually only responding 
to reward or punishment. This was the case with Clever Hans, a horse with the amazing ability
to tap out answers to math problems. But it turns out Hans 
wasn't especially good at math, but at reading his unwitting 
trainer's subtle nonverbal cues for when to stop tapping. So Hans couldn't count,
but does that mean he wasn't thinking? After all, he could interpret 
nuanced social messages, a quality he shared with many other
non-human animals. Elephants recognize each other
after years apart, and even seem to mourn their dead. Bees communicate 
using a special waggle dance to indicate the location and quality 
of a food source to other bees. Chimpanzees engage 
in complex deception schemes, suggesting not only do they think,
but they understand that others do, too. And then there is Alex the Grey Parrot, who could use human language to distinguish the colors 
and shapes of absent objects, and even understand abstract concepts,
like bigger and smaller. That sounds a lot like intelligence, and not just the work 
of mindless machines. But while a non-human animal can solve
problems and even communicate, for humans, thinking 
also involves consciousness, the ability to reflect on our actions,
not simply to perform them. So far, none of our studies tell us
if having the intelligence to outsmart us means that our dog 
can also feel good about doing so. What we really want to know is
what is it like to be a dog, or an octopus, or a crow? Philosophers of mind call this
The Hard Problem, because while you and I can report
what it feels like to be a human, nobody speaks horse. Even a talking parrot, like Alex, couldn't tell us how he feels 
about the colors he could name. And what if consciousness 
comes in different forms? Would we even recognize 
the consciousness of bees? For that matter, how can we know for sure
that other people have consciouness? Perhaps they're just 
well-functioning zombies. Regardless, animal minds continue to test
the limits of our understanding and how we frame them may reveal more
about our minds than theirs.

1. Match each ground truth MCQ with the most similar generated MCQ from the provided set. To determine similarity, consider the question content, options, and overall intent of the MCQ.

**Transcript**:
Your dog loves to curl up on the couch,
but so do you, so you shoo him off
and settle in for a cozy evening. After all, you're the human around here. You're an intelligent being,
not a simple creature of instinct. You can plan and dream, and oh- Did your dog just outsmart you
and feel happy about it? Or was he just following his instincts? Is there even a difference? What is he thinking? Well, it depends on 
what we mean by "thinking" and the criteria we use to evaluate it. Aristotle and Descartes both use 
the criteria of instinct and intelligence to divide animals from humans. Aristotle believed 
that humans possess reason, while animals could only follow brute
instincts for survival and reproduction. Almost 2000 years later, Descartes suggested 
a more extreme version of that idea, arguing that animals following instincts
were indistinguishable from robots responding mechanically 
to stimuli in their environments. But the consensus against animal 
intelligence began to unravel with Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Darwin hypothesized that intelligence
could evolve from simpler instincts. He had observed earthworms making choices
about how to drag oddly shaped leaves into their boroughs, and was struck that a human might employ
similar means to solve a similar problem. And if, as he thought, humans 
are descended from simpler creatures, then perhaps our minds lie
at the far end of a continuum, differing from theirs in degree,
but not in kind. Recent experiments showing that many
species can solve complex problems confirm Darwin's initial hypothesis. Elephants use objects to reach
inaccessible places. Crows make their own tools, and can use water displacement 
to get a reward. Octopuses can open jars 
after watching others do so, and can even remember 
the process months later. Such tasks involve considering 
aspects of a problem separately from the immediate situation,
and retaining the strategy for later use. Still, while animals 
can solve complex problems, how do we know what, or even that, 
they are thinking? Behaviorists, such as Pavlov
and Thorndike, argue that animals that appear to think are usually only responding 
to reward or punishment. This was the case with Clever Hans, a horse with the amazing ability
to tap out answers to math problems. But it turns out Hans 
wasn't especially good at math, but at reading his unwitting 
trainer's subtle nonverbal cues for when to stop tapping. So Hans couldn't count,
but does that mean he wasn't thinking? After all, he could interpret 
nuanced social messages, a quality he shared with many other
non-human animals. Elephants recognize each other
after years apart, and even seem to mourn their dead. Bees communicate 
using a special waggle dance to indicate the location and quality 
of a food source to other bees. Chimpanzees engage 
in complex deception schemes, suggesting not only do they think,
but they understand that others do, too. And then there is Alex the Grey Parrot, who could use human language to distinguish the colors 
and shapes of absent objects, and even understand abstract concepts,
like bigger and smaller. That sounds a lot like intelligence, and not just the work 
of mindless machines. But while a non-human animal can solve
problems and even communicate, for humans, thinking 
also involves consciousness, the ability to reflect on our actions,
not simply to perform them. So far, none of our studies tell us
if having the intelligence to outsmart us means that our dog 
can also feel good about doing so. What we really want to know is
what is it like to be a dog, or an octopus, or a crow? Philosophers of mind call this
The Hard Problem, because while you and I can report
what it feels like to be a human, nobody speaks horse. Even a talking parrot, like Alex, couldn't tell us how he feels 
about the colors he could name. And what if consciousness 
comes in different forms? Would we even recognize 
the consciousness of bees? For that matter, how can we know for sure
that other people have consciouness? Perhaps they're just 
well-functioning zombies. Regardless, animal minds continue to test
the limits of our understanding and how we frame them may reveal more
about our minds than theirs.

**Ground Truth MCQ**:
Question: Consciousness--the ability to reflect on or experience one's own actions--is sometimes called the "hard problem" among philosophers of mind. Why is the "hard problem" so hard?
Options: A. Because we can't observe what is like to experience the world from the perspective of a nonhuman being, B. Because nonhuman animals don't feel anything, C. Because the ability to reflect on one's actions is limited to humans, D. Because only parrots and horses have learned to communicate their thoughts to humans, E.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until

logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness

Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
Most of us will shut down a range of possible options (moving abroad, trying out a new career,
leaving a partner) by saying,  ‘that’s if I didn’t have to worry about money.' This passivity in the face of money enraged
Sartre at a political level. He thought of capitalism as a giant machine designed to
create a sense of necessity which doesn’t in fact exist in reality: it makes us tell ourselves we have to work
a certain number of hours, buy a particular product or service, and so on. But in this, there is only the denial of freedom
– and a refusal to take as seriously as we should the possibility of living in other
ways. It was because of these views that Sartre
had a life long interest in Marxism. Marxism seemed in theory to allow people to explore
their freedom, by reducing the role played in their lives by material considerations. Sartre took part in many protests in the streets
of Paris in the 60s. Arrested yet again in 1968, President Charles de Gaulle had him
pardoned, saying, “you don’t arrest Voltaire.” Sartre also visited Fidel Castro and Che Guevara
and admired them both deeply. As a result of these connections and his radical politics,
the FBI kept a large file on Sartre trying to deduce what his suspicious philosophy might
really mean. Sartre is inspiring in his insistence that
things do not have to be the way they are. He is hugely alive to our unfulfilled potential,
as individuals and as a species. He urges us to accept the fluidity of existence and to create new institutions, habits, outlooks
and ideas. The admission that life doesn’t have some
preordained logic and is not inherently meaningful can be a source of immense relief when we
feel oppressed by the weight of tradition and the status quo.

**Transcript**:
Jean-Paul Sartre made thinking and philosophy
glamorous. He was born in Paris in 1905. His father,
a navy captain, died when he was a baby – and he grew up extremely close to his mother until
she remarried, much to his regret, when he was twelve. Sartre spent most of his life in Paris, where
he often went to cafes on the Left Bank. He had a strabismus, a wandering eye, and wore
distinctive, heavy glasses. He was very short (five feet three inches) and frequently described
himself as ugly. By the 60’s Sartre was a household name
in both Europe and the United States, and so was his chosen philosophy, Existentialism. Sartre is famous principally for his book
Being and Nothingness (1943), which enhanced his reputation not so much because people
could understand his ideas  but because they couldn't quite. Existentialism was built around a number of
key insights: One: Things are weirder than we think Sartre is acutely attentive to moments when
the world reveals itself as far stranger and more uncanny than we normally admit; moments
when the logic we ascribe to it day-to-day becomes unavailable, showing things to be
highly contingent and even absurd and frightening. Sartre’s first novel – Nausea, published
in 1938 – is full of evocations of such moments. At one point, the hero, Roquentin,
a 30-year-old writer living in a fictional French seaside town, is on a tram. He puts his hand on the seat, but then pulls
it back rapidly. Instead of being the most basic and obvious piece of design, scarcely
worth a moment’s notice, the seat promptly strikes him as deeply strange; the word ‘seat’ comes loose from its moorings,
the object it refers to shines forth in all its primordial oddity, as if he’s never
seen one before. Roquentin has to force himself to remember that this thing beside him is
something for people to sit on. For a terrifying moment, Roquentin has peered into what Sartre
calls the ‘absurdity of the world.’ Such a moment goes to the heart of Sartre’s
philosophy. To be Sartrean is to be aware of existence as it is when it has been stripped
of any of the prejudices and stabilising assumptions lent to us by our day-to-day routines. We can try out a Sartrean perspective on many
aspects of our own lives. Think of what you know as ‘the evening meal with your partner’. Under such a description, it all seems fairly
logical, but a Sartrean would strip away the surface normality to show the radical strangeness
lurking beneath. Dinner really means that:
when your part of the planet has spun away from the energy of a distant hydrogen and
helium explosion, you slide your knees under strips of a chopped-up
tree and put sections of dead animals and plants
in your mouth and chew, while next to you, another mammal whose genitals
you sometimes touch is doing the same. Two: We are free Such weird moments are certainly disorienting
and rather scary, but Sartre wants to draw our attention to them for one central reason:
because of their liberating dimensions. Life is a lot odder than we think, but it’s
also as a consequence far richer in possibilities. Things don’t have to be quite the way they
are. In the course of fully realising our freedom, we will come up against what Sartre calls the ‘angoisse’ or ‘anguish’ of existence.
Everything is (terrifyingly) possible because nothing has any pre-ordained, God-given sense
or purpose. Humans are just making it up as they go along,
and are free to cast aside the shackles at any moment. Three: We shouldn’t live in ‘Bad faith’ Sartre gave a term to the phenomenon of living
without taking freedom properly on board. He called it BAD FAITH. We are in bad faith whenever we tell ourselves
that things have to be a certain way and shut our eyes to other options. It is bad faith to insist that we have to
do a particular kind of work or live with a specific person or make our home in a given
place. The most famous description of ‘bad faith’
comes in Being and Nothingness, when Sartre notices a waiter who strikes him as overly
devoted to his role, as if he were first and foremost a waiter rather than a free human
being. His movement is quick and forward, a little
too precise, a little too rapid. He comes towards the patrons with a step that is a
little too quick. He bends forward a little too eagerly: his voice, his eyes express an
interest a little too solicitous for the order of the customer…’ The man (he was probably modelled on someone
in Saint-Germain’s Café de Flore) has convinced himself that he is essentially, necessarily
a waiter rather than a free creature who could be a jazz pianist or a fisherman on a North
Sea trawler. Four: We're free to dismantle capitalism. The one factor that most discourages people from experiencing themselves as free is money.
