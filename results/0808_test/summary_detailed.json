        "category": "Psychology",
        "summary": "**Summary**\n\nTalking to oneself, also known as self-talk, is a normal and essential aspect of human behavior that has been extensively researched in psychology. Most people engage in some form of self-talk every day, which can be verbalized thoughts directed towards themselves or aspects of their life. Self-talk serves various purposes, including planning, working through difficult situations, and motivating oneself throughout the day.\n\nResearch suggests that what we say to ourselves matters, as it can have real impacts on our attitude and performance. Engaging in instructional or motivational self-talk has been shown to increase focus, boost self-esteem, and help tackle everyday tasks. On the other hand, negative self-talk can be toxic and predictive of anxiety and depression.\n\nThe origins of self-talk are rooted in childhood experiences, where children often speak to themselves out loud as they play. As they grow older, this outward self-talk tends to become internalized, morphing into a private inner dialogue. Scientists are still working to answer basic questions about self-talk, such as why some people self-talk more than others and what areas of the brain are activated during self-talk.\n\n**Key Points**\n\n* Self-talk is normal and essential for human behavior\n* Most people engage in some form of self-talk every day\n* Self-talk serves various purposes, including planning, working through difficult situations, and motivating oneself throughout the day\n* What we say to ourselves matters, as it can have real impacts on our attitude and performance\n* Engaging in instructional or motivational self-talk has been shown to increase focus, boost self-esteem, and help tackle everyday tasks\n* Negative self-talk can be toxic and predictive of anxiety and depression\n* Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a field of psychological treatment that focuses on regulating the tone of self-talk\n\n**Important Details**\n\n* Self-talk refers to the narration inside one's head, sometimes called inner speech\n* Psychologists define self-talk as verbalized thoughts directed towards oneself or some facet of one's life\n* Children often speak to themselves out loud as they play, which is key to development according to Lev Vygotsky's hypothesis\n* Self-talk can be internalized and become a private inner dialogue as people grow older\n* Scientists are still working to answer basic questions about self-talk, such as why some people self-talk more than others and what areas of the brain are activated during self-talk\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTalking to oneself is a normal and essential aspect of human behavior that has been extensively researched in psychology.

Engaging in instructional or motivational self-talk can increase focus, boost self-esteem, and help tackle everyday tasks.

By being kind to our inner voice and regulating its tone, we can improve our mental health and well-being."
