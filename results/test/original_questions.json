        "transcript": "Human history is intertwined with some of Earth's mightiest species, but there is one graceful creature that rises above the\nrest. Only when seen it in its ideal habitat, can\nwe truly appreciate this king among birds. Behold: the nobel pigeon.\" If you think they're only good for pooping\non statues, then think again. [OPENING MUSIC] In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin\npresented an idea that changed the world. He knew if he was right, this idea was gonna\nturn science on its head, so in chapter 1, you know what he chose as his very first\nexample? It wasn't the tortoises, or finches, or\neven the giant fossil armadillos he found during his journeys. He chose pigeons. Over giant fossil armadillos. But he had a good reason, and if you think\notherwise, then you've never seen FANCY pigeons. These are the birds that got Darwin's attention,\nbecause underneath all that feathery fashion, is just one species, like dogs with wings\ninstead of rats with wings. All of that variation was tweaked from one\nancient mold. The wild rock dove. Thousands of years before they were eating\nold hot dog buns out of the trash, these birds were found on seaside cliffs, but pretty much\nas soon as cities sprung up, they moved in, because to a pigeon, a building is just\na cliff with better architecture. Pigeons are uniquely suited to city life,\nbut they were only able to conquer all of Earth's urban areas because we brought them\nthere. Why? Because we liked feeding them… to ourselves. In fact, from Egypt to Rome to the early 20th\ncentury, the main roles of a pigeon were dinner, or something for rich people to breed into\nsilly shapes. Over time here and there, a few of these domestic\nbirds escaped and returned to a \"wild\" life, they just never left the city. But for some reason along that journey, our opinion\nof pigeons went from this… to this. Watch pigeons pecking at the sidewalk and\nyou're not looking at the smartest birds in the tree. They can't solve puzzles like crows. They can't talk like parrots. A pigeon's brain is only about the size\nof that fingertip… but like most things in nature there's more to the story. Most of their skull is eyeball: if they were\nthe size of humans, their eyes would be as big as grapefruits… Those huge eyes have five color receptors,\ncompared to our three, letting them see things we can't imagine. One pigeon named Linus was trained to remember\nnearly a thousand images. Pigeons can peck out a Monet from a Picasso,\nthey can even judge if a child's drawing is good or bad. Pigeons can tell correctly spelled words among\nmisspelled words, As if they aren't annoying enough.. They can even put groups of objects in numerical\norder, which sounds easy because we're smart, but pigeons do numbers as well as monkeys\ndo, Pigeon vision is the bomb. Literally. During WW II, psychologist B.F. Skinner tried\nto turn these birds into weapons. He trained pigeons to keep an image centered\non a tiny screen by pecking at it. He hooked this up to a navigation system,\nand then loaded it inside of a bomb. He wanted to create explosive missiles piloted\nby kamikaze pigeons. He built several successful prototypes using\nmoney from the General Mills cereal company… yes, the people who make Cheerios, but the\nArmy never let it get off the ground. Pigeon navigation goes a lot farther than\nbird bombs. Just like /human/ city-dwellers, pigeons are\ncommuters, flying out in the morning to find food and coming back at night. They're tightly bonded to their home, and\nthis instinct is so strong that we've used them as messengers for centuries, like Flapchat\ninstead of Snapchat. Before Paul Reuter founded a global news service,\nhe used pigeons to deliver news. During World War I and II, racing pigeons\nwith names like Cher Ami and GI Joe were given actual medals for delivering messages under\nfire. How are pigeons so good at finding their way\nhome from places they've never been? Different experiments have found pigeons use\nvisual maps, Earth's magnetic field, the angle of the sun, even smells to navigate. But when scientists knock each of these senses\nout, some birds can still find their way home. What we do know is pigeons use a lot of senses,\nmaybe even some we don't know about yet. Even though pigeons are everywhere, there's\none thing you never seem to see: Baby pigeons. They do exist, and… they are ugly. But it's a reminder that even a bird that's\neverywhere only gives us glimpses into its life. Darwin's ideas about natural selection were\nborn on a voyage around the world. But you don't have to go to exotic places\nto have your mind blown by evolution's awesomeness. Darwin knew that, and that's why he picked\nthe pigeon to introduce the world to his theory. If you know where to look, wildlife is everywhere that\nwe are: just make sure if you look up to admire it, you keep your mouth closed. Stay curious. I want to thank our friends from BBC Earth\nfor helping us make this episode, because pigeons look awesome in slow-motion. Some of pigeons' oldest enemies have followed\nthem to cities: birds of prey. These scientists are studying peregrine falcons\nfor Planet Earth II, the sequel to the groundbreaking BBC series. It's part of \"Cities\", an entire episode\ndedicated to urban wildlife. Of course, birds of prey aren't pigeons'\nonly urban predators. For Planet Earth II, the team filmed a pigeon\nhunt you have to see to believe. You can find Planet Earth II on BBC One in\nthe UK and coming soon to BBC America.
