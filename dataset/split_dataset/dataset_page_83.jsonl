In just a few generations, this beylik\noutmaneuvered more powerful neighbors to become the vast Ottoman empire. What enabled its rapid rise? In Osman’s time, the Anatolian peninsula\nwas a patchwork of Turkic principalities sandwiched between a crumbling\nByzantine Empire and weakened Sultanate\nof the Seljuk of Rum. Osman quickly expanded this territory through a mixture of strategic\npolitical alliances and military conflicts \nwith these neighbors, attracting mercenaries first\nwith the promise of booty, then later through his reputation \nfor winning. Osman was the first in a line \nof Ottoman rulers distinguished by their political shrewdness. Often prioritizing political and military\nutility over ethnic or religious affinity, they expanded their influence by fighting\nalong certain sides when needed, and fighting against them \nwhen the time was right. After Osman’s death his son Orhan established a sophisticated military\norganization and tax collection system geared towards funding \nquick territorial expansion. The Ottomans’ first major expansion\nwas in the Balkans, in southeast Europe. The military employed a mixture\nof Turkic warriors and Byzantine and other Balkan Christian converts. They captured thousands \nof young Christian boys from villages from across the Balkans, converted them to Islam, and trained\nthem to become the backbone of a fierce military elite force\nknown as the Janissaries. The captured enslaved boys could rise\nto the high position of a vizier in the Ottoman government. Rulers of conquered areas were\nalso allowed, even encouraged, to convert to Islam and take positions\nin the Ottoman government. Meanwhile, non-Muslims \nwho belonged to Abrahamic religions were allowed religious freedom \nin exchange for a tax known as Jizye, among other strict conditions— for example, they were not allowed\nto join the army. By the end of the 14th century, \nthe Ottomans had conquered or subordinated most of the Anatolian beyliks \nas well as the Balkans. But in the first half of the 15th century, as Sultan Beyazit I focused\non Western expansion, the Central Asian ruler Timur attacked\nfrom the east. He captured Beyazit and carted\nhim off in an iron cage, sparking a ten year struggle \nfor succession that almost destroyed the Ottoman empire. Sultan Murad II turned this trend around, but fell short of one \nof his loftiest goals: capturing the Byzantine capital,\nConstantinople. His son, Sultan Mehmed II, \nor Mehmed the Conqueror, vowed to succeed where his father\nhad failed. In preparation for the attack \non Constantinople, he hired a Hungarian engineer \nto forge the largest cannon in the world, used Serbian miners to dig tunnels\nunder the walls of the city, and ordered his fleet of ships\nto be carried overland, attacking the city \nfrom an unexpected direction. He laid siege to the city \nand in the spring of 1453, Constantinople fell to the Ottomans. It would become the Ottoman capital, \nknown by its common Greek name, Istanbul, meaning “to the city.” By the time Mehmed II\nconquered Constantinople, the city was a shadow of its former glory. Under Ottoman rule, \nit flourished once again. On an average day in Istanbul, you could\nhear people speaking Greek, Turkish, Armenian, Persian, Arabic, Bulgarian,\nAlbanian, and Serbian. Architects like the famous Sinan\nfilled the city with splendid mosques and other buildings commissioned\nby the sultans. Through Istanbul, the Otttomans brought\ncommodities like coffee to Europe. They entered a golden age \nof economic growth, territorial acquisition, \nart and architecture. They brought together craftspeople \nfrom across Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia to create\na unique blend of cultural innovation. Iznik ceramics, for example, were made using techniques\nfrom China’s Ming dynasty, reimagined with Ottoman motifs. The Ottomans would continue to expand, cementing their political influence\nand lucrative trade routes. The empire lasted for more than 600 years \nand, at its peak, stretched from Hungary\nto the Persian Gulf, from the Horn of Africa\nto the Crimean Peninsula."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Under Ottoman Islamic rule non-Mulsims identifying as members of ------ religious communities were allowed religious freedoms:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Orthodox Christian"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jewish"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Catholic Christians"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Jewish and Christian"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Ottoman rulers were often distinguished for their political acumen, often prioritizing ----- when making strategic decisions.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Religious affinity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ethnic affinity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Political and Military utility"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Janissaries were an Elite military fighting force made up of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Christian men from the Balkans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Muslim boys trained in Istanbul"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Christian boys converted and trained in Istanbul"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Muslim men who originated from Christian families"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The name of the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, comes from", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Turkish word for Constantinople"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Arabic word for Constantinople"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A common Greek form of referring “to the city”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The name of the Ottoman hero “Estani”"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the Above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "At its peak territorial expansion, the Ottoman Empire covered", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All of Asia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Southeastern Europe and western Asia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "North Africa and the Red Sea Basin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A and B are correct"}, {"label": "E", "text": "B and C are correct"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

Her grace was known throughout the land, and many powerful princes and wealthy\nmerchants flocked to her family’s palace to seek her hand in marriage. But upon witnessing her blinding splendor\nin person, the men lost their nerve. Unimpressed with these suitors, the princess determined\nto find a husband herself. Mounting her golden chariot, \nshe travelled through rolling deserts, glittering cities \nand snow-capped mountains— rejecting many men along the way. Eventually, Savitri ventured \ndeep into the jungle, where she met a young man \nchopping wood. His name was Satyavan, and like her,\nhe loved the tranquil forest— but the princess saw he was not at peace. After talking for hours, Satyavan told\nher of his plight. His parents had once been wealthy rulers, until his father was blinded \nand overthrown in a violent coup. Now Satyavan worked tirelessly \nto support their meager new life. His determination and devotion\nmoved the princess. As they gazed into each other’s eyes,\nshe knew she’d finally found an equal. Savitri rushed home to tell\nher father the good news, only to find him conversing with Narada a traveling sage and wisest messenger \nof the Gods. At first her father was thrilled\nto learn of Satyavan, but Narada revealed a tragic prophecy:\nher betrothed had only a year to live. Savitri’s blood ran cold. She’d waited so long to find her partner—\nwas she already doomed to lose him? The princess would not accept these terms. She swore before Narada, her family, and Savitr himself that she would\nnever marry another. Satyavan was her one true love,\nand their fates were entwined forever. Moved by her powerful words, the sage told the princess to follow\nan ancient spiritual regimen. With regular prayer, periods of fasting, and preparation of special\nherbs and plants, she might be able to prolong\nSatyavan’s life. After a simple wedding, the couple\nreturned to the jungle to live in keeping with the sage’s instructions. This modest existence was a far cry\nfrom her lavish upbringing, but they were happy in each other’s\ncompany. A year passed, and the fated day arrived. On their first anniversary, \nthe sun grew horribly hot, and Satyavan’s brow began to burn, Savitri barely had time to drag \nhim into the shade, before he grew still and cold. Through her tears, the princess\nsaw an immense figure on the horizon. This was Yamraj, the God of Death, come to escort Satyavan’s soul \nto the afterlife. But Savitri was not giving up yet. She followed the god for hours\nin the beating sun. Yamraj thundered at the princess\nto leave him in peace. But even as her feet bled and throat\nburned, Savitri would not turn back. Eventually, Yamraj paused. He would grant her one wish \nas reward for her persistence, but she couldn’t ask\nfor her husband’s life. Without hesitating, Savitri asked the God \nto restore her father in-law’s sight. The wish was granted, and Yamraj rode on. But still Savitri’s footsteps\nechoed behind him. Exasperated, the God granted\nher a second wish. This time, she asked for Satyavan’s\nkingdom to be restored. Again the wish was granted, and Yamraj began his descent \ninto his subterranean kingdom. But when he glanced back, he was astounded to see \nthe bedraggled princess stumbling along. He’d never seen such devotion to the dead, and he honored her dedication\nwith one final wish. Savitri wished to be the mother\nof many children. The God agreed, and waved to dismiss her. But the princess only repeated the vow\nshe’d made one year earlier: her fate was forever entwined\nwith Satyavan. How could she bear many children,\nif Yamraj would not return her husband? Hearing this clever question the god\nrelented, knowing he’d been beaten. With Yamraj’s blessing and respect,\nSatyavan was returned to Savitri, and the two walked back \nto the land of the living, united in a love that not even\ndeath could destroy."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Savitri left the palace because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She wanted to get away from her parents"}, {"label": "B", "text": "She wanted an adventure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "She didn’t want to be a princess any more"}, {"label": "D", "text": "She wanted to live in the jungle"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Savitri met Satyavan", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In the city, working"}, {"label": "B", "text": "At the temple, worshipping"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the jungle, chopping wood"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "At the wedding, Narada told Savitri that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She would have many children"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That Satyavan would betray her"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That Satyavan would soon be dead"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Yamraj is the God of ___ and he rides on a ___", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Death; water buffalo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Love; horse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "War; lion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Discord, wolf"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "For her third and final wish, Savitri asked:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "For her husband to be brought back from the dead"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To be the mother of many children"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To be returned to her parents"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To find a new husband"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Jacobs", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-life-cycle-of-a-cup-of-coffee-a-j-jacobs", "transcript": {"en": "How many people does it take to make\na cup of coffee? For many of us, all it takes is a short\nwalk and a quick pour. But this simple staple is the result \nof a globe-spanning process whose cost and complexity are far greater\nthan you might imagine. It begins in a place like the remote\nColombian town of Pitalito. Here, family farms have clear cut \nlocal forests to make room for neat rows of Coffea trees. These shrub-like plants \nwere first domesticated in Ethiopia and are now cultivated throughout\nequatorial regions. Each shrub is filled with small berries\ncalled \"coffee cherries.\" Since fruits on the same branch \ncan ripen at different times, they’re best picked by hand, but each farm has its own method\nfor processing the fruit. In Pitalito, harvesters toil \nfrom dawn to dusk at high altitudes, often picking over 25 kilograms per shift\nfor very low wages. The workers deliver their picked cherries\nto the wet mill. This machine separates the seeds\nfrom the fruit, and then sorts them by density. The heaviest, most flavorful seeds \nsink to the bottom of the mill, where they’re collected \nand taken to ferment in a tub of water for one or two days. Then, workers wash off the remaining fruit\nand put the seeds out to dry. Some farms use machines for this process, but in Pitalito, seeds are spread\nonto large mesh racks. Over the next three weeks, \nworkers rake the seeds regularly to ensure they dry evenly. Once the coffee beans are dry, a truck takes them to a nearby mill\nwith several specialized machines. An air blower re-sorts the seeds \nby density, an assortment of sieves filter \nthem by size, and an optical scanner sorts by color. At this point, professionals called\nQ-graders select samples of beans to roast and brew. In a process called \"cupping,\" \nthey evaluate the coffee’s taste, aroma, and mouthfeel to determine its quality. These experts give the beans a grade,\nand get them ready to ship. Workers load burlap sacks \ncontaining up to 70 kilograms of dried and sorted coffee beans\nonto steel shipping containers, each able to carry \nup to 21 metric tons of coffee. From tropical ports, cargo ships \ncrewed by over 25 people transport coffee around the world But no country imports more coffee\nthan the United States, with New York City alone consuming\nmillions of cups every day. After the long journey \nfrom Colombia to New Jersey, our coffee beans pass through customs. Once dockworkers unload the container, a fleet of eighteen-wheelers transport \nthe coffee to a nearby warehouse, and then to a roastery. Here the beans go into a roasting machine,\nstirred by a metallic arm and heated by a gas-powered fire. Nearby sensors monitor the coffee’s\nmoisture level, chemical stability, and temperature, while trained coffee\nengineers manually adjust these levels throughout the twelve-minute\nroasting cycle. This process releases oil within the seed, transforming the seeds into grindable,\nbrewable beans with a dark brown color and rich aroma. After roasting, workers pack the beans\ninto five-pound bags, which a fleet of vans deliver to cafes\nand stores across the city. The coffee is now so close \nyou can smell it, but it needs more help \nfor the final stretch. Each coffee company has a head buyer who carefully selects beans \nfrom all over the world. Logistics teams manage \nbean delivery routes, and brave baristas across the city\nserve this caffeinated elixir to scores of hurried customers. All in all, it takes hundreds of people\nto get coffee to its intended destination— and that’s not counting everyone\nmaintaining the infrastructure that makes the journey possible. Many of these individuals work \nfor low pay in dangerous conditions— and some aren’t paid at all. So while we might marvel at the global\nnetwork behind this commodity, let’s make sure we don’t value \nthe final product more than the people who make it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In which country was the Coffee tree first domesticated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ethiopia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kenya"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Somalia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sudan"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the term for the small berries that contain the coffee seed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Coffee grapes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Coffee nuts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Coffee cherries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Coffee husks"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the title for professionals who select samples of beans to roast and brew?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A-graders"}, {"label": "B", "text": "C-graders"}, {"label": "C", "text": "T-graders"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Q-graders"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which country imports the most coffee?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "China"}, {"label": "B", "text": "India"}, {"label": "C", "text": "United Kingdom"}, {"label": "D", "text": "United States"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is NOT monitored during the roasting of the coffee beans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Moisture level"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Noise level"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Temperature"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chemical stability"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "How much do the burlap sacks containing dried coffee beans weigh?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 kgs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "125 kgs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70 kgs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "200 kgs"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 83, "lesson": 4, "title": "Do personality tests work? - Merve Emre", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-personality-tests-work-merve-emre", "transcript": {"en": "In 1942, a mother-daughter duo Katherine Cook Briggs\nand Isabel Briggs Myers developed a questionnaire that classified\npeople’s personalities into 16 types. Called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator,\nor MBTI, it would go on to become one of the world’s \nmost widely-used personality tests. Today, personality testing \nis a multi-billion dollar industry used by individuals, schools,\nand companies. But none of these tests, including \nthe MBTI, the Big Five, the DiSC assessment, \nthe Process Communication Model, and the Enneagram, actually reveal truths about personality. In fact, it’s up for debate \nwhether personality is a stable, measurable feature \nof an individual at all. Part of the problem is the way the tests\nare constructed. Each is based on a different set \nof metrics to define personality: the Myers-Briggs, for instance, focuses on features like introversion \nand extroversion to classify people into\npersonality \"types,\" while the Big Five scores participants\non five different traits. Most are self-reported, meaning the results are based on questions\nparticipants answer about themselves. So it’s easy to lie, but even with \nthe best intentions, objective self-evaluation is tricky. Take this question from the Big Five: How would you rate the accuracy\nof the statement \"I am always prepared\"? There’s a clear favorable answer here,\nwhich makes it difficult to be objective. People subconsciously aim to please: when asked to agree or disagree,\nwe show a bias toward answering however we believe \nthe person or institution asking the question wants us to answer. Here’s another question— what do you value more, \njustice or fairness? What about harmony or forgiveness? You may well value both sides \nof each pair, but the MBTI would force \nyou to choose one. And while it’s tempting to assume \nthe results of that forced choice must somehow reveal a true preference,\nthey don’t: When faced with the same forced choice\nquestion multiple times, the same person will sometimes\nchange their answer. Given these design flaws, it’s no surprise\nthat test results can be inconsistent. One study found that nearly half of people\nwho take the Myers-Briggs a second time only five weeks after the first\nget assigned a different type. And other studies on the Myers-Briggs have\nfound that people with very similar scores end up being placed \nin different categories, suggesting that the strict divisions\nbetween personality types don’t reflect real-life nuances. Complicating matters further, the definitions of personality traits \nare constantly shifting. The Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung, who popularized the terms\nintrovert and extrovert, defined an introvert as someone who sticks\nto their principles regardless of situation, and an extrovert as someone who molds\ntheir self according to circumstance. Introversion later came to mean shyness,\nwhile an extrovert was someone outgoing. Today, an introvert is someone who finds\nalone time restorative, an extrovert draws energy \nfrom social interaction, and an ambivert falls somewhere\nbetween these two extremes. The notion of an innate, \nunchanging personality forms the basis of all these tests. But research increasingly suggests that\npersonality shifts during key periods— like our school years,\nor when we start working. Though certain features \nof a person’s behavior may remain relatively stable over time, others are malleable, moulded by our\nupbringing, life experiences, and age. All of this matters more or less depending\non how a personality test is used. Though anyone using them should take\nthe results with a grain of salt, there isn’t much harm in individual use— and users may even learn some \nnew terms and concepts in the process. But the use of personality tests extends\nfar beyond self discovery. Schools use them to advise students\nwhat to study and what jobs to pursue. Companies use them decide who to hire\nand for what positions. Yet the results don’t predict how a person\nwill perform in a specific role. So by using personality tests this way, institutions can deprive people \nof opportunities they’d excel at, or discourage them from considering \ncertain paths."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In what year was the Myers-Briggs test created?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1897"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1980"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1942"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1900"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who invented the Myers-Briggs personality test?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sigmund Freud"}, {"label": "B", "text": "University of Chicago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carl Jung"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Katherine Briggs and Isabel Myers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are some reasons why personality tests are not accurate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The personality tests are based on different sets of metrics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The answers are self-reported and it’s easy to lie"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Personality may not be stable and can change over time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Approximately how many people who take the Myers-Briggs test a second time get a different answer?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Almost half of the people who take the test"}, {"label": "B", "text": "One third of the people who take the test"}, {"label": "C", "text": "None"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Everyone"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What shapes an individual’s personality?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The music they listen to"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Their upbringing, life experiences, and age"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The personality test they take"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their education and the books they read"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Here's how we prepare - Colette Pichon Battle", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/climate-change-will-displace-millions-here-s-how-we-prepare-colette-pichon-battle", "transcript": {"en": "It was about two years\nafter Hurricane Katrina that I first saw the Louisiana flood maps. These flood maps are used\nto show land loss in the past and land loss that is to come. On this particular day,\nat a community meeting, these maps were used to explain how a 30-foot tidal surge\nthat accompanied Hurricane Katrina could flood communities like mine\nin south Louisiana and communities across\nthe Mississippi and Alabama coast. It turns out that the land we were losing\nwas our buffer from the sea. I volunteered to interact\nwith the graphics on the wall, and in an instant my life changed\nfor the second time in two years. The graphic showed\nmassive land loss in south Louisiana and an encroaching sea, but more specifically, the graphic showed\nthe disappearance of my community and many other communities\nbefore the end of the century. I wasn't alone at the front of the room. I was standing there with other members\nof south Louisiana's communities -- black, Native, poor. We thought we were just bound\nby temporary disaster recovery, but we found that we were now bound\nby the impossible task of ensuring that our communities\nwould not be erased by sea level rise due to climate change. Friends, neighbors, family, my community: I just assumed it would always be there. Land, trees, marsh, bayous: I just assumed that it would be there\nas it had been for thousands of years. I was wrong. To understand what was happening\nto my community, I had to talk to other communities\naround the globe. I started in south Louisiana\nwith the United Houma Nation. I talked to youth advocates\nin Shishmaref, Alaska. I talked to fisherwomen\nin coastal Vietnam, justice fighters in Fiji, new generations of leaders in the ancient cultures\nof the Torres Straits. Communities that had been here\nfor thousands of years were suffering the same fate, and we were all contemplating\nhow we would survive the next 50. By the end of the next century, it's predicted that\nmore than 180 million people will be displaced due to climate change, and in south Louisiana, those who can afford to do so\nare already moving. They're moving because\nsouth Louisiana is losing land at one of the fastest rates on the planet. Disappearance is what my bayou community has in common with\nother coastal communities. Erasure is what communities\naround the globe are fighting as we get real about\nthe impacts of climate change. I've spent the last 14 years\nadvocating on behalf of communities that have been directly impacted\nby the climate crisis. These communities\nare fighting discrimination within climate disaster recovery, and they're also trying to balance\nmass displacement of people with an influx of others who see opportunity in starting anew. Since 2005, people\nhave been called \"refugees\" when they leave when they're displaced\nby climate disaster, even when they don't cross\ninternational borders. These terms, these misused terms, that are meant to identify the other, the victim, the person who is not supposed to be here, these terms are barriers to economic recovery, to social integration and to the healing required from\nthe climate crisis and climate trauma. Words matter. It also matters how we treat\npeople who are crossing borders. We should care about how people\nwho are crossing borders today to seek refuge and safety\nare being treated, if for no other reason than it might\nbe you or someone you love who needs to exercise\ntheir human right to migrate in the nearby future. We must start preparing\nfor global migration today. It's a reality now. Our cities and our communities\nare not prepared. In fact, our economic system\nand our social systems are only prepared to make profit\noff of people who migrate. This will cause rounds\nof climate gentrification, and it will also penalize\nthe movement of people, usually through exploited labor and usually through criminalization. Climate gentrification that happens\nin anticipation of sea level rise is what we're seeing in places like Miami, where communities\nthat were kept from the waterfront are now being priced out\nof the high ground where they were placed originally as people move away from the coast. These folks are being moved,\nforced to relocate away from the social and economic systems\nthat they need to survive. Climate gentrification also happens\nin the aftermath of climate disaster. When massive amounts\nof people leave a location for an indefinite amount of time, we see others come in. We also see climate gentrification happen when damaged homes are now \"green built,\" but now have a higher value, generally outside of the reach\nof black and brown and poor people who want to return home. The price difference in rents\nor the ownership of a house is the difference between\nbeing able to practice your right, your human right\nto return home as a community, or be forced to resettle somewhere else less climate resilient, less expensive and alone. The climate crisis\nis a much larger conversation than reducing CO2 emissions, and it is a much different conversation\nthan just extreme weather. We're facing a shift\nin every aspect of our global reality. And climate migration\nis just one small part, but it's going to have ripple effects in both coastal cities\nand cities in the interior. So what do we do? I have a few ideas. (Laughter) First, we must reframe\nour understanding of the problem. Climate change is not the problem. Climate change\nis the most horrible symptom of an economic system that has been built for a few to extract every precious value\nout of this planet and its people, from our natural resources to the fruits of our human labor. This system has created this crisis. (Applause) We must have the courage\nto admit we've taken too much. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the entire world is paying a price for the privilege and comfort\nof just a few people on the planet. It's time for us to make\nsociety-wide changes to a system that incentivizes consumption to the point of global imbalance. Our social, political and economic\nsystems of extraction must be transformed into systems\nthat regenerate the earth and advance human liberty globally. It is arrogance to think\nthat technology will save us. It is ego to think that we can continue this unjust and extractive approach\nto living on this planet and survive. (Applause) To survive this next phase\nof our human existence, we will need to restructure\nour social and economic systems to develop our collective resilience. The social restructuring must be\ntowards restoration and repair of the earth and the communities\nthat have been extracted from, criminalized and targeted for generations. These are the frontlines. This is where we start. We must establish a new social attitude\nto see migration as a benefit, a necessity for our global survival, not as a threat\nto our individual privilege. Collective resilience means developing\ncities that can receive people and provide housing, food, water, health care and the freedom from overpolicing for everyone, no matter who they are, no matter where they're from. What would it mean if we started\nto plan for climate migration now? Sprawling cities or declining cities\ncould see this as an opportunity to rebuild a social infrastructure\nrooted in justice and fairness. We could actually put money\ninto public hospitals and help them prepare for what is to come\nthrough climate migration, including the trauma\nthat comes with loss and relocation. We can invest more of our time in justice, but it cannot be for temporary gain, it cannot be to help budget shortfalls, it has to be for long-term change and it has to be to advance justice. It's already possible, y'all. After Hurricane Katrina, universities and high schools\naround the US took in students to help them finish their semester\nor their year without missing a beat. Those students are now\nproductive assets in our community, and this is what our communities,\nour businesses and our institutions need to get ready for now. The time is now. So as we reframe the problem\nin a more truthful way and we restructure our social systems\nin a more just way, all that will be left is for us\nto reindigenize ourselves and to conjure a power\nof the most ancient kind. This necessarily means\nthat we must learn to follow -- not tokenize, not exotify, not dismiss -- the leadership and\nthe traditional knowledge of a particular local place. It means that we must commit\nto standards of ecological equity and climate justice and human rights as the basis, a base standard, a starting point, for where our new society is to go. All of this requires us to recognize\na power greater than ourselves and a life longer\nthan the ones we will live. It requires us to believe in the things\nthat we are privileged enough not to have to see. We must honor the rights of nature. We must advance human rights for all. We must transform from a disposable, individual society into one that sees our collective,\nlong-term humanity, or else we will not make it. We must see that even the best of us\nare entangled in an unjust system, and we must acknowledge that the only way you're going to survive is for us to figure out how to reach a shared liberation together. The good news is we come from powerful people. We come from those who have,\nin one way or another, survived so far to be us here today. This is reason enough to fight. And take it from\nyour south Louisiana friend, those hardest fights\nare the ones to celebrate. Let's choose to make this next phase\nof our planetary existence beautiful, and while we're at it, let's make it just and fair for everyone. We can do this, y'all. We can do this, because we must. We must, or else we lose our planet and we lose ourselves. The work starts here. The work starts together. This is my offering. Thank you for receiving it. Merci.

And rather than using finite fossil fuels, this massively powerful plant relied on\na time-tested source of renewable energy: running water. Stretching over 2.3 kilometers, China’s Three Gorges Dam isn’t just \nthe world’s largest hydroelectric plant. It’s capable of producing more energy\nthan any other power plant on Earth. So what allows Three Gorges \nto generate all this power? And how do hydroelectric plants\nwork in the first place? A hydroelectric dam is essentially \na massive gate, which redirects a river’s natural flow\nthrough a large pipe called a penstock. Rushing water flows through the penstock\nand turns the blades of a turbine, which is attached to a generator\nin an adjacent power station. The turning of the blades spins coils\nof wire inside a magnetic field, producing a steady supply of electricity. Because the penstocks can be sealed\nat any time, a dam can hold back excess water\nduring stormy seasons, and save it for dry ones. This allows hydroelectric dams \nto produce power regardless of the weather, while simultaneously preventing\nfloods further downstream. These benefits have long appealed \nto China’s Hubei Province. Located near the basin\nof the Yangtze River, this region is prone to deadly floods\nduring rainy seasons when the Yangtze’s flow is strongest. Plans to build a dam that would\ntransform this volatile waterway into a stable source of power circulated\nthroughout the 20th century. When construction finally began in 1994\nthe plans were epic. The dam would contain 32 turbines—\n12 more than the previous record holder, South America’s Itaipu Dam. The turbines would supply energy \nto two separate power stations, each connecting to a series of cables\nspanning hundreds of kilometers. Electricity from Three Gorges would\nreach power grids as far away as Shanghai. However, the human costs \nof this ambition were steep. To create the dam’s reservoir, workers needed to flood over \n600 square kilometers of land upstream. This area included 13 cities, \nhundreds of villages, and over 1,000 historical\nand archaeological sites. The construction displaced roughly\n1.4 million people, and the government’s relocation programs\nwere widely considered insufficient. Many argued against this controversial\nconstruction, but others estimated that the lives\nsaved by the dam’s flood protection would outweigh the trauma \nof displacement. Furthermore, raising the water level\nupstream would improve the river’s navigability, increase shipping capacity,\nand transform the region into a collection \nof prosperous port towns. When the project was completed in 2012, China became the world’s largest\nproducer of electricity. In 2018, the dam generated 101.6 billion\nkilowatt-hours. That’s enough electricity to power \nnearly 2% of China for one year; or to power New York City \nfor almost two years. This is a truly astonishing amount\nof energy. And yet, two years earlier, \nanother dam less than half the size actually generated more electricity. Despite Three Gorges record-setting scale,\nthe Itaipu Dam still produced more power. To understand why Itaipu can outperform\nThree Gorges, we need to look at the two factors\nthat determine a dam’s energy output. The first is the number of turbines. Three Gorges has the world’s highest\ninstalled turbine capacity, meaning it’s theoretically capable \nof producing over 50% more power than Itaipu. But the second factor is the force \nand frequency of water moving through those turbines. Three Gorges spans several deep, narrow\nravines surging with powerful water. However, the Yangtze’s seasonal changes\nkeep the dam from reaching its theoretical maximum output. The Itaipu Dam, on the other hand, is located atop what was previously\nthe planet’s largest waterfall by volume. Although the dam’s construction destroyed\nthis natural wonder, the constant flow of water allows Itaipu to consistently generate more\npower each year. This dam rivalry is far from over, and other projects like the Inga Falls Dam\nin the Democratic Republic of Congo are also vying for the title \nof most powerful power plant. But whatever the future holds,\ngovernments will need to ensure that a power plant’s environmental\nand human impact are as sustainable as the energy\nit produces."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which river is the dam built on?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yangtze River"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yellow River"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pearl River"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of these was NOT a factor in favor of the dam’s consideration?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flood control"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Improved navigation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Military defense"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What type of dam is the Three Gorges Dam?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Arch dam"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gravity dam"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Barrage dam"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT one of the negative impacts of the dam?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flooding and displacement of residents upstream"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Damage to local ecosystems"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Drying up areas downstream"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How does the dam actually generate energy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The water evaporates, causing steam to rise"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The water pushes turbine blades, whose turning generates electricity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The water undergoes a chemical reaction, converting it into energy"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 83, "lesson": 8, "title": "10 ways to have a better conversation - Celeste Headlee", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/10-ways-to-have-a-better-conversation-celeste-headlee", "transcript": {"en": "All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have\nunfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive\nabout politics or religion, childcare, food? (Laughter) And how many of you\nknow at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want\nto talk to them? (Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order\nto have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice\nof Henry Higgins in \"My Fair Lady\": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change\nand anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- (Laughter) are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential\nto devolve into an argument, where our politicians\ncan't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately\nfor it and against it, it's not normal. Pew Research did a study\nof 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment,\nwe are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're\nnot listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even\nwho our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means\nwe're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance\nbetween talking and listening, and somewhere along the way,\nwe lost that balance. Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all\neither have in your hands or close enough that you could\ngrab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers\nsend more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them,\nare more likely to text their friends than they are to talk\nto them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher\nnamed Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids\na communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak\non a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: “I came to realize...” (Laughter) \"I came to realize\nthat conversational competence might be the single\nmost overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging\nwith ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal\ncommunications skills. It might sound like a funny question,\nbut we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain\ncoherent, confident conversation?\" Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like.\nI talk to people that I don’t like. I talk to some people that I disagree with\ndeeply on a personal level. But I still have\na great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes\nor so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. Many of you have already heard\na lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics\nto discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show\nthat you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard\nor summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap. (Laughter) There is no reason to learn\nhow to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I actually use the exact\nsame skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you\nhow to interview people, and that's actually going to help you\nlearn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time,\nwithout getting bored, and, please God,\nwithout offending anybody. We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before.\nWe know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you\nwalk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel\nlike you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions\ncan't be like that. So I have 10 basic rules.\nI'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose\none of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations. Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean\njust set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys\nor whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument\nyou had with your boss. Don't think about what\nyou're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out\nof the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it\nand half out of it. Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response\nor argument or pushback or growth, write a blog. (Laughter) Now, there's a really good reason\nwhy I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to\nhate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations\nand Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation\nassuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires\na setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means\nsetting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become\nless and less vulnerable and more and more likely\nto open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have\nsomething to learn. Bill Nye: \"Everyone you will ever meet\nknows something that you don't.\" I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something. Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who,\nwhat, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question,\nyou're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, \"Were you terrified?\" you're going to respond to the most\npowerful word in that sentence, which is \"terrified,\" and the answer is\n\"Yes, I was\" or \"No, I wasn't.\" \"Were you angry?\" \"Yes, I was very angry.\" Let them describe it.\nThey're the ones that know. Try asking them things like,\n\"What was that like?\" \"How did that feel?\" Because then they might have to stop\nfor a moment and think about it, and you're going to get\na much more interesting response. Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts\nwill come into your mind and you need to let them\ngo out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking\nfor several minutes and then the host comes back in\nand asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere,\nor it's already been answered. That means the host probably\nstopped listening two minutes ago because he thought\nof this really clever question, and he was just bound\nand determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having\na conversation with someone, and then we remember that time\nthat we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. (Laughter) And we stop listening. Stories and ideas\nare going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. Number five: If you don't know,\nsay that you don't know. Now, people on the radio,\nespecially on NPR, are much more aware\nthat they're going on the record, and so they're more careful\nabout what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap. Number six: Don't equate\nyour experience with theirs. If they're talking\nabout having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time\nyou lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble\nthey're having at work, don't tell them about\nhow much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly,\nit is not about you. You don't need to take that moment\nto prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once\nwhat his IQ was, and he said, \"I have no idea. People who brag\nabout their IQs are losers.\" (Laughter) Conversations are not\na promotional opportunity. Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending,\nand it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations\nor in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it\nover and over. Don't do that. Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling\nto come up with in your mind. They don't care.\nWhat they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. Number nine: This is not the last one,\nbut it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many\nreally important people have said that listening is perhaps the most,\nthe number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, \"If your mouth is open,\nyou're not learning.\" And Calvin Coolidge said, \"No man\never listened his way out of a job.\" (Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything\nI'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks\nat about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to\n500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in\nthose other 275 words. And look, I know,\nit takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that,\nyou're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out\nbarely related sentences in the same place. (Laughter) You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, \"Most of us don't listen\nwith the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply.\" One more rule, number 10,\nand it’s this one: Be brief. Be interested in other people. You know, I grew up\nwith a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual \nin my home. People would come over\nto talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave,\nmy mother would come over to us, and she’d say, \n“Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize.\nHe's a Russian ballet dancer.\" And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden,\namazing thing about them. And honestly, I think\nit's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut\nas often as I possibly can. I keep my mind open. And I’m always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly,\nbe prepared to be amazed. Thanks.

In his great hall of Breidablik, Baldur’s soothing presence \neased his subject’s woes. But lately, he was plagued \nby troubles of his own. Every night, Baldur had gruesome visions \nforetelling his own imminent death. Determined to protect her son \nfrom these grim prophecies, Queen Frigg travelled \nacross the nine realms, begging all living things \nnot to harm Baldur. Her grace moved each being \nshe encountered. Every animal and element, every plague \nand plant, every blade and bug gladly gave their word. Frigg returned to Breidablik, \nand threw a great feast to celebrate. Wine flowed freely, and soon the gods \ntook turns testing Baldur’s immunity. Lurking in the corner, \nLoki rolled his eyes. The trickster god had never cared \nfor Baldur the Bright, and found his new gift \nprofoundly irritating. Surely there was a flaw in Frigg’s plan. Taking the form of an old woman, Loki crept to Frigg’s side \nand feigned confusion. Why were the gods attacking sweet Baldur, \nwhom they all loved so dearly? Frigg told her of the oaths, \nbut the old woman pressed on. Surely you didn’t receive a vow \nfrom everything, she asked. Frigg shrugged. The only being she hadn’t visited \nwas mistletoe. After all, what god could fear \na trifling weed? At this, Loki dashed outside \nto find a sprig of mistletoe. When he returned, the festivities \nhad grown even rowdier. But not every god was enjoying the party. Baldur’s brother Hodur, who was blind \nand weapon-less, sat dejected. Seeing his opportunity, the trickster slyly offered \nHodur a chance to participate. Loki armed him with mistletoe, \nguided his aim towards his brother, and told Hodur to hurl with all his might. The mistletoe pierced Baldur’s chest \nwith deadly force. The god’s light quickly flickered out, \nand despair swept over the crowd. Within moments, the impact \nof Baldur’s death could be felt across the nine realms. But from the weeping masses, \nHermod the Brave stepped forward. The warrior god believed that with \nthe help of Odin’s mighty steed, there was no plane he could not reach. He would travel to halls of Hel herself, \nand bring Baldur home. The god rode for nine days \nand nine nights, past halls of corpses \nand over paths paved with bone. When he finally reached \nthe Queen of the Underworld, Hermod begged her to return \nBaldur to his family. Hel considered taking pity, but she wanted\nto know the extent of the gods’ mourning. She agreed to relinquish Baldur’s soul— if Hermod could prove that every \nliving thing wept at Baldur’s death. Hermod shot back \nto the land of the living. He met with every creature \nthat Frigg visited earlier— all of which cried for Baldur \nand begged for his return. Meanwhile, Loki watched Hermod’s \nmission with disdain. He would not let his work \nbe so easily undone, but if he interfered too boldly it might \nreveal his hand in Baldur’s murder. Disguising himself as a ferocious giant, \nhe hid himself at Hermod’s final stop. When the warrior came, the howling wind and craggy rocks \neach declared their love for Baldur. But the giant within spewed only contempt \nfor the deceased. No matter how much Hermod begged, \nshe would not shed a single tear. With his last hope dashed, the god began \nto mourn Baldur a second time. But an echo from the cave \nrang out above his sobs. Loki’s twisted cackle was well-known \nto every Asgardian, and Hermod realized he’d been tricked. As he leapt to accost the trickster, Loki took the form of a salmon \nand wriggled into the waterfall. His escape was guaranteed, \nuntil Thor arrived at the scene. Dragging Loki back to the cave, the gods \nbound him with a poisonous serpent. Here, Loki would remain chained \nuntil the end of days— the serpent dripping venom \non his brow as punishment for dousing Asgard’s brightest light."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Baldur was the God of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Love"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Truth and light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "War and peace"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Death"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Frigg begged all living things to spare her son, except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mistletoe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Iron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fir trees"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Grass"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After ___ had tricked ___ into killing Baldur, __ set out to rescue him.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Loki; Odin; Frigg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Loki; Hermod; Frigg"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Odin; Hod; Loki"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Loki; Hodur; Hermod"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In death, Baldur was located:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In Breidablik"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the Gjaller River"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In Hel"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The only living thing that did not proclaim its love for Baldur was", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A sprig of mistletoe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A stubborn giant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The goddess of the Underworld"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Baldur’s brother"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 83, "lesson": 10, "title": "Why is pneumonia so dangerous? - Eve Gaus and Vanessa Ruiz", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-pneumonia-so-dangerous-eve-gaus-and-vanessa-ruiz", "transcript": {"en": "Every time you breathe in, \nair travels down the trachea, through a series of channels\ncalled bronchi, and finally reaches little clusters\nof air sacs called alveoli. There are some 600 million alveoli\nin the lungs, adding up to a surface area \nof roughly 75 square meters— the size of a tennis court. These tiny sacs, only one cell thick,\nfacilitate a crucial exchange: allowing oxygen from the air \nwe breathe into the bloodstream and clearing out carbon dioxide. Pneumonia wreaks havoc \non this exchange. Pneumonia is an infection of the alveoli\nthat causes them to fill with fluid. There are many different kinds \nof pathogens that can cause pneumonia. The most common ones \nare viruses or bacteria. These microscopic invaders enter the body\nvia droplets either in the air we breathe, or when we touch our eyes, noses, or mouths after touching \na contaminated surface. Then, they face the respiratory tract’s\nfirst line defense: the mucociliary escalator. The mucociliary escalator consists of\nmucus that traps invaders and tiny hairs called cilia that carry the mucus toward\nthe mouth, where it can be coughed out. But some of these invaders \nmay get past the mucociliary escalator into the lungs,\nwhere they meet the alveoli. Because alveoli serve \nas critical exchange points between the blood and air \nfrom the outside world, they have their own specialized types\nof white blood cells, or macrophages, which defend against foreign organisms\nby enveloping and eating them. When pathogens enter the lungs,\nthe macrophages work to destroy them. The immune system releases additional\nwhite blood cells in the alveoli to help. As these immune cells fight the pathogens,\nthey generate inflammation— and fluid as a by-product \nof the inflammation. When this fluid builds up, it makes gas exchange inside \nthe alveoli much more difficult. As the level of carbon dioxide \nin the bloodstream begins to rise, the body breathes more quickly to try\nto clear it out and get more oxygen in. This rapid breathing is one of the most\ncommon symptoms of pneumonia. The body also tries to force the fluid out\nof the alveoli through coughing. Determining the cause of pneumonia \ncan be difficult, but once it is established, \ndoctors can prescribe antibiotics, which may include either antibacterial\nor antiviral treatments. Treatment with antibiotics helps \nthe body get the infection under control. As the pathogen is cleared out, the body gradually expels or absorbs\nfluid and dead cells. The worst symptoms typically fade out\nin about a week, though full recovery may take \nas long as a month. Otherwise healthy adults can often\nmanage pneumonia at home. But for some groups, pneumonia \ncan be a lot more severe, requiring hospitalization and oxygen,\nartificial ventilation, or other supportive measures \nwhile the body fights the infection. Smoking damages the cilia, making them less able to clear even\nthe normal amount of mucus and secretions, let alone the increased volume \nassociated with pneumonia. Genetic and autoimmune disorders can make someone more susceptible\nto pathogens that can cause pneumonia. Young children and the elderly \nalso have impaired clearance and weaker immune systems. And if someone has viral pneumonia, their risk of bacterial respiratory\ninfection is higher. Many of the deaths from pneumonia \nare due to lack of access to healthcare. But sometimes, even with appropriate care, the body enters a sustained fight against\nthe infection it can’t maintain, activating inflammatory pathways\nthroughout the body, not just in the lungs.

She’s about to pass through the garden\nundetected, when she overhears the king\nand queen arguing. “It’s quite simple,” says the queen.\n“64 is the same as 65, and that’s that.” Without thinking, Alice interjects. \n“Nonsense,” she says. “If 64 were the same as 65, \nthen it would be 65 and not 64 at all.” “What? How dare you!” the queen huffs. “I’ll prove it right now, \nand then it’s off with your head!” Before she can protest, Alice is dragged toward a field \nwith two chessboard patterns— an 8 by 8 square and a 5 by 13 rectangle. As the queen claps her hands, \nfour odd-looking soldiers approach and lie down next to each other,\ncovering the first chessboard. Alice sees that two of them are trapezoids\nwith non-diagonal sides measuring 5x5x3, while the other two are long triangles\nwith non-diagonal sides measuring 8x3. “See, this is 64.” The queen claps her hands again. The card soldiers get up, \nrearrange themselves, and lie down atop the second chessboard. “And that is 65.\" Alice gasps. She’s certain the soldiers\ndidn’t change size or shape moving from one board to the other. But it’s a mathematical certainty \nthat the queen must be cheating somehow. Can Alice wrap her head around what’s\nwrong— before she loses it? Pause the video to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Just as things aren’t looking too good \nfor Alice, she remembers her geometry, and looks again at the trapezoid \nand triangle soldier lying next to each other. They look like they cover exactly half\nof the rectangle, their edges forming one long line \nrunning from corner to corner. If that’s true, then the slopes \nof their diagonal sides should be the same. But when she calculates these slopes using the tried and true formula\n\"rise over run,\" a most curious thing happens. The trapezoid soldier’s diagonal side\ngoes up 2 and over 5, giving it a slope of two fifths, or 0.4. The triangle soldier’s diagonal, however,\ngoes up 3 and over 8, making its slope three eights, or 0.375. They’re not the same at all! Before the queen’s guards can stop her, Alice drinks a bit of her shrinking potion\nto go in for a closer look. Sure enough, there’s a miniscule gap\nbetween the triangles and trapezoids, forming a parallelogram that stretches\nthe entire length of the board and accounts for the missing square. There’s something even more curious\nabout these numbers: they’re all part of the Fibonacci series, where each number is the sum \nof the two preceding ones. Fibonacci numbers have two properties\nthat factor in here: first, squaring a Fibonacci number \ngives you a value that’s one more or one less than the product of the Fibonacci numbers\non either side of it. In other words, 8 squared is one less \nthan 5 times 13, while 5 squared is one more \nthan 3 times 8. And second, the ratio between successive\nFibonacci numbers is quite similar. So similar, in fact, that it eventually\nconverges on the golden ratio. That’s what allows devious royals\nto construct slopes that look deceptively similar. In fact, the Queen of Hearts could cobble\ntogether an analogous conundrum out of any four consecutive\nFibonacci numbers. The higher they go, the more it seems \nlike the impossible is true.

{"page": 83, "lesson": 12, "title": "How fast is the speed of thought? - Seena Mathew", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-fast-is-the-speed-of-thought-seena-mathew", "transcript": {"en": "Your mortal enemy has captured you\nand hooked you up to a bizarre experiment. He’s extended your nervous system \nwith one very long neuron to a target about 70 meters away. At some point, \nhe’s going to fire an arrow. If you can then think a thought \nto the target before the arrow hits it, he’ll let you go. So who wins that race? In order to answer, we have to examine\nthe hardware of thought: neurons. The human brain has about 86 billion \nof these cells. They transmit signals down their axons \nby way of electrical impulses, or action potentials. One neuron can then pass that signal \nto the next at a synapse by way of chemical neurotransmitters. The signal is received \nby the next neuron’s dendrites, propagated down its axon,\nand passed further along. So, the key factors that determine \nhow quickly you think include how long it takes to generate \nan initial action potential; propagate it down the length of the axon;\nand transport it through the synapse. We must also factor in the number \nof neurons involved and the distance the signal has to travel. Let’s see what this looks like in a simple\npathway— your knee-jerk reflex. A strike to your patellar tendon \ntriggers an electrical impulse that travels up a sensory neuron \nto your spine. There the signal branches, \nand for the sake of simplicity, we’ll consider the segment that jumps\ninto a motor neuron to journey back down your leg. The total length of the neurons \nin that pathway is about 1 meter in someone \nwho is 5 foot 5 inches, and on average it takes \n15 to 30 milliseconds from strike to kick. Speed is distance divided by time, so this signal travels somewhere \nbetween 120 to 240 kilometers per hour. The initial action potential accounts \nfor 1 to 5 milliseconds and synaptic transmissions only take \n.1 to .5 milliseconds, so the bulk of that time\nis spent within the axons. This is consistent with research findings that the average individual neuron sends\nsignals at around 180 kilometers per hour. But speeds can be boosted with myelination\nand increased axon diameter. Myelin is a fatty sheath \nthat insulates an axon, preventing electrical currents\nfrom leaking out. Meanwhile, axons with larger diameters\noffer less internal resistance. These compounded factors can raise\nthe speed of an action potential as high as 432 kilometers per hour. There’s plenty of variation: \nsome people think faster than others, and your own speed of thought changes\nthroughout your lifetime. In particular, as you reach old age, the myelin sheath covering your axons\nwears down, and other neuronal structures degrade. Back to the dastardly experiment. Arrows shot from recurve bows fly,\non average, around 240 kilometers per hour. Which means that given a sufficiently\nlong, myelinated or large-diameter neuron, your thoughts actually could win the race. But… there’s a wrinkle. The arrow and thought don’t leave \nthe gate at the same time; first the arrow fires, \nthen once you perceive it, your signal can start down its path. Processing images or music, \nparticipating in inner speech, and recalling memories all require\ncomplicated neural pathways that are nowhere close to the linearity\nof the knee-jerk reflex. The speed at which these thoughts\noccur is mostly consistent, with variations based on myelination\nand axon diameter. But the duration of a thought will vary\nsignificantly depending on its routes, pitstops, and destination. In this case, when you perceive\na threatening stimulus, you’ll invoke a fear startle response. Similar to the knee-jerk response, a startle can be involuntary \nand quite fast. If the string twangs loud enough, you might react \nin less than 65 milliseconds. More likely though, your startle reaction\nwill be based on sight. Our eyes can process an image \nas quickly as 13 milliseconds, but computation of what you’re seeing\nand determining the danger it poses can take as long \nas 180 to 200 milliseconds. In that time the arrow will have gained\na head start of about 13 meters. The target is far enough away that you’ve got just enough \nof a chance to catch up, if you can quickly, and quite literally,\nthink your way out."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following neurons would have the fastest signal transmission?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "large diameter myelinated axon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "large diameter unmyelinated axon"}, {"label": "C", "text": "small diameter myelinated axon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "small diameter unmyelinated axon"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Neurons that send pain signals are generally unmyelinated fibers while those that send visual signals are myelinated.

With a group of heavily armed accomplices, he set sail for Honduras in hopes\nof reclaiming power by whatever means necessary. Bonilla had a powerful backer, the future leader \nof a notorious organization known throughout Latin America \nas El Pulpo, or \"the Octopus,\" for its long reach. The infamous El Pulpo \nwas a U.S. corporation trafficking in, of all things,\nbananas. It was officially known \nas United Fruit Company— or Chiquita Brands International today. First cultivated in Southeast Asia\nthousands of years ago, bananas reached the Americas \nin the early 1500s, where enslaved Africans cultivated\nthem in plots alongside sugar plantations. There were many different bananas, most of which looked nothing like\nthe bananas in supermarket aisles today. In the 1800s, captains \nfrom New Orleans and New England ventured to the Caribbean in search \nof coconuts and other goods. They began to experiment with bananas,\npurchasing one kind, called Gros Michel, from Afro-Caribbean\nfarmers in Jamaica, Cuba, and Honduras. Gros Michel bananas produced large bunches\nof relatively thick-skinned fruit— ideal for shipping. By the end of the 1800s, \nbananas were a hit in the US. They were affordable, \navailable year-round, and endorsed by medical doctors. As bananas became big business, U.S. fruit companies wanted \nto grow their own bananas. In order to secure access to land, banana moguls lobbied and bribed\ngovernment officials in Central America, and even funded coups to ensure \nthey had allies in power. In Honduras, Manuel Bonilla repaid \nthe banana man who had financed his return to power\nwith land concessions. By the 1930s, one company dominated\nthe region: United Fruit, who owned over 40% of Guatemala’s \narable land at one point. They cleared rainforest in Costa Rica,\nColombia, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama to build plantations, along with railroads, ports, \nand towns to house workers. Lured by relatively high-paying jobs,\npeople migrated to banana zones. From Guatemala to Colombia, United Fruit’s plantations grew\nexclusively Gros Michel bananas. These densely packed farms \nhad little biological diversity, making them ripe for disease epidemics. The infrastructure connecting \nthese vulnerable farms could quickly spread disease: pathogens could hitch a ride from one\nfarm to another on workers’ boots, railroad cars, and steamships. That’s exactly what happened in the 1910s, when a fungus began to level \nGros Michel banana plantations, first in Panama, and later throughout\nCentral America, spreading quickly via the same system that\nhad enabled big profits and cheap bananas. In a race against “Panama Disease,” banana companies abandoned \ninfected plantations in Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala, leaving thousands of farmers and workers \njobless. The companies then felled \nextensive tracts of rainforests in order to establish new plantations. After World War II, the dictatorships with which United Fruit\nhad partnered in Guatemala and Honduras yielded to democratically elected\ngovernments that called for land reform. In Guatemala, President Jacobo Arbenz\ntried to buy back land from United Fruit and redistribute it to landless farmers. The Arbenz government offered to pay\na price based on tax records— where United Fruit had underreported\nthe value of the land. El Pulpo was not happy. The company launched propaganda\ncampaigns against Arbenz and called on its deep connections \nin the US Government for help. Citing fears of communism,\nthe CIA orchestrated the overthrow of the democratically elected \nArbenz in 1954. That same year in Honduras, thousands\nof United Fruit workers went on strike until the company agreed to recognize\na new labor union. With the political and economic costs \nof running from Panama Disease escalating, United Fruit finally switched \nfrom Gros Michel to Panama disease-resistant Cavendish\nbananas in the early 1960s. Today, bananas are no longer \nas economically vital in Central America, and United Fruit Company, \nrechristened Chiquita, has lost its stranglehold\non Latin American politics. But the modern banana industry\nisn’t without problems. Cavendish bananas require frequent\napplications of pesticides that create hazards for farmworkers \nand ecosystems.

Nicknamed General Sherman, this giant sequoia has sequestered\nroughly 1,400 tons of atmospheric carbon over its estimated 2,500 years on earth. Very few trees can compete \nwith this carbon impact, but today, humanity produces more \nthan 1,400 tons of carbon every minute. To combat climate change, we need to steeply reduce \nfossil fuel emissions, and draw down excess CO2 \nto restore our atmosphere’s balance of greenhouse gases. But what can trees do to help\nin this fight? And how do they sequester carbon \nin the first place? Like all plants, trees consume\natmospheric carbon through a chemical reaction \ncalled photosynthesis. This process uses energy \nfrom sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide \ninto oxygen and energy-storing carbohydrates. Plants then consume \nthese carbohydrates in a reverse process called respiration, \nconverting them to energy and releasing carbon \nback into the atmosphere. In trees, however, a large portion\nof that carbon isn’t released, and instead, is stored \nas newly formed wood tissue. During their lifetimes, \ntrees act as carbon vaults, and they continue to draw down carbon \nfor as long as they grow. However, when a tree dies\nand decays, some of its carbon will be released\nback into the air. A significant amount of CO2\nis stored in the soil, where it can remain \nfor thousands of years. But eventually, that carbon\nalso seeps back into the atmosphere. So if trees are going to help \nfight a long-term problem like climate change, they need to survive to sequester \ntheir carbon for the longest period possible, \nwhile also reproducing quickly. Is there one type of tree \nwe could plant that meets these criteria? Some fast growing, long-lived, \nsuper sequestering species we could scatter worldwide? Not that we know of. But even if such a tree existed, it wouldn’t be a good \nlong-term solution. Forests are complex networks \nof living organisms, and there’s no one species \nthat can thrive in every ecosystem. The most sustainable trees to plant \nare always native ones; species that already play a role \nin their local environment. Preliminary research shows \nthat ecosystems with a naturally occurring diversity\nof trees have less competition for resources and better resist\nclimate change. This means we can’t just plant trees \nto draw down carbon; we need to restore depleted ecosystems. There are numerous regions\nthat have been clear cut or developed that are ripe for restoring. In 2019, a study led \nby Zurich’s Crowtherlab analyzed satellite imagery \nof the world’s existing tree cover. By combining it with climate and soil data and excluding areas necessary\nfor human use, they determined Earth could support nearly one billion hectares \nof additional forest. That’s roughly 1.2 trillion trees. This staggering number surprised\nthe scientific community, prompting additional research. Scientists now cite a more conservative \nbut still remarkable figure. By their revised estimates,\nthese restored ecosystems could capture anywhere from 100 to 200\nbillion tons of carbon, accounting for over one-sixth\nof humanity’s carbon emissions. More than half of the potential\nforest canopy for new restoration efforts \ncan be found in just six countries. And the study can also provide insight\ninto existing restoration projects, like The Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares\nof forest by 2030. But this is where it gets complicated. Ecosystems are incredibly complex, and it’s unclear whether they’re best \nrestored by human intervention. It’s possible the right thing \nto do for certain areas is to simply leave them alone. Additionally, some researchers\nworry that restoring forests on this scale may have unintended \nconsequences, like producing natural bio-chemicals at a pace that could actually \naccelerate climate change. And even if we succeed \nin restoring these areas, future generations would need\nto protect them from the natural and economic forces\nthat previously depleted them. Taken together, these challenges\nhave damaged confidence in restoration projects worldwide. And the complexity \nof rebuilding ecosystems demonstrates how important \nit is to protect our existing forests. But hopefully, restoring \nsome of these depleted regions will give us the data and conviction \nnecessary to combat climate change on a larger scale.

Humans are tireless\nin their pursuit of reason. \"It’s 1950. Following threats from the communist \ngovernments of the Soviet Union and China, anti-communist sentiment in \nthe United States is at an all-time high. Senator Joseph McCarthy claims \nhe has a list of 205 communists in the US who are influencing government policy.\" Didn’t I just change the channel? Ah, I see. It’s a different witch hunt. \"The senate forms a committee \nto investigate McCarthy’s claims. McCarthy names his first case: against prominent lawyer, judge,\nand activist Dorothy Kenyon. He accuses her of membership to 28 \norganizations that are communist fronts. Newspapers around the country \nrush to her defense, pointing out her vocally \nanti-communist record. The senate committee schedules \na hearing anyway, and she has just five days to prepare.\" This is too much. If the government won’t be \na voice of reason, I’ll have to. That’s better. I’m surprised you good legislators\nhave agreed to move this hearing forward. You’re falling prey to a type \nof argument from ignorance: assuming that a claim is true \nbecause it hasn’t been proven false. The claim being Senator McCarthy’s \naccusations against Judge Kenyon, for which he provided \nno legitimate evidence. Is that right? I thought so. Some of the so-called communist \norganizations he accused her of joining don’t even exist.

If someone told you aliens exist, would you head off to find proof\nthat they don’t exist? Of course not. You’d tell that person \nto show you the UFO.

They buried chests in the desert sand,\nhid them in caves, and sealed them in secret rooms. Inside these chests was a treasure \nmore valuable than gold: the city’s ancient books. Founded around 1100 CE \nin what is now Mali, the city of Timbuktu started \nout as an unremarkable trading post. But its unique location \nsoon changed that. Timbuktu marked the intersection\nof two essential trade routes, where caravans bringing \nsalt across the Sahara met with traders bringing gold\nfrom the African interior. By the late 1300s, these trade routes \nmade Timbuktu rich, and the city’s rulers, \nthe kings of the Mali Empire, built monuments and academies\nthat drew scholars from Egypt, Spain, and Morocco. The city’s prime location also made\nit a target for warlords and conquerors. As the Mali Empire declined, \none of its domains, Songhai, began to gain power. In 1468, the Songhai king \nconquered Timbuktu, burning buildings and murdering scholars. But in time, intellectual life \nin the city flourished again. The reign of the second king \nof the Songhai Empire, Askia Mohammed Toure, marked the beginning of a golden age \nin Timbuktu. He reversed his predecessor’s\nregressive policies and encouraged learning. The Songhai rulers and most of Timbuktu’s \npopulation were Muslim, and the scholars of Timbuktu \nstudied Islam alongside secular topics \nlike mathematics and philosophy. In the libraries of Timbuktu, tracts of Greek philosophy stood\nalongside the writings of local historians, scientists,\nand poets. The city’s most prominent scholar,\nAhmed Baba, challenged prevailing opinions\non subjects ranging from smoking to slavery. Gold and salt trade had funded\nthe city’s transformation into a center of learning. Now, the products \nof that intellectual culture became the most sought-after \ncommodity. With paper from faraway Venice and vibrant ink from local plants\nand minerals, the scribes of Timbuktu produced \ntexts in both Arabic and local languages. Written in calligraphy and decorated\nwith intricate geometric designs, the books of Timbuktu were in demand\namong the wealthiest members of society. In 1591, the golden age \ncame to an abrupt end when the Moroccan king \ncaptured Timbuktu. Moroccan forces imprisoned \nAhmed Baba and other prominent scholars and confiscated their libraries. In the centuries that followed, the city \nweathered a succession of conquests. In the mid-1800s, \nSufi Jihadists occupied Timbuktu and destroyed many non-religious\nmanuscripts. 1894, French colonial forces seized\ncontrol of the city, stealing even more manuscripts\nand sending them to Europe. French became the official language\ntaught in schools, and new generations in Timbuktu couldn’t read the Arabic manuscripts \nthat remained. Through it all, the literary tradition\nof Timbuktu didn’t die— it went underground. Some families built secret libraries\nin their homes, or buried the books in their gardens. Others stashed them in abandoned caves \nor holes in the desert. The priceless manuscripts of Timbuktu dispersed to villages \nthroughout the surrounding area, where regular citizens guarded \nthem for hundreds of years. As desertification and war \nimpoverished the region, families held on to the ancient books even as they faced desperate poverty\nand near-starvation. Even today, the struggle to protect\nthe books continues. From the 1980s to the early 2000s, Timbuktu scholar Abdel Kader Haidara\npainstakingly retrieved hidden manuscripts from all over northern Mali \nand brought them back to Timbuktu. But in 2012, civil war in Mali \nonce again threatened the manuscripts, most of which were evacuated\nto nearby Bamako. Their future remains uncertain, as they face both human \nand environmental threats. These books represent our best—\nand often only— sources on the pre-colonial history\nof the region. Many of them have never been \nread by modern scholars, and still more remain lost \nor hidden in the desert.

{"page": 83, "lesson": 17, "title": "Which type of milk is best for you? - Jonathan J. O’Sullivan & Grace E. Cunningham", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/which-type-of-milk-is-best-for-you-jonathan-j-o-sullivan-grace-e-cunningham", "transcript": {"en": "If you go to the store in search of milk, there are a dizzying number \nof products to choose from. There’s dairy milk, \nbut also plant-based products. To turn a plant into something\nresembling milk, it must be either soaked, drained,\nrinsed, and milled into a thick paste, or dried, and milled into flour. The plant paste or flour is then \nfortified with vitamins and minerals, flavoured, and diluted with water. The result is a barrage of options that share many of the qualities\nof animal milk. So which milk is actually best for you? Let’s dive into some of the most \npopular milks: dairy, almond, soy, or oat? A 250 ml glass of cow’s milk contains\n8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, \nand 2 to 8 grams of fat depending on if it’s skim, \nreduced fat, or whole. That’s approximately 15% \nthe daily protein an average adult needs, roughly 10% the carbohydrates\nand 2 to 15% the fat. Most plant-based milks have \nless carbohydrates than dairy milk. They also have less fat, but more\nof what’s often called “good fats.” Meanwhile, the healthy nutrients\nvitamin D and calcium found in dairy milk don’t occur naturally \nin most plant-based milks. Looking more closely \nat our plant-based milks, both almond and oat are low \nin protein compared to dairy. But while almond milk has the least\nnutrients of the four, oat milk is full of beta-glucans, \na healthy type of fibre. It also has a lot of carbohydrates\ncompared to other plant milks— sometimes as much as dairy milk. Soy milk, meanwhile, \nhas as much protein as cow’s milk and is also a great source\nof potassium. Soybeans contain isoflavone, which people used to think \nmight trigger hormonal imbalances by mimicking the function of estrogen. But ultimately, soy milk contains\nvery small amounts of isoflavones, which have a much weaker effect\non our bodies than estrogen. Depending on individual circumstances, one of these milks may be\nthe clear winner: if you’re lactose intolerant, \nthen the plant-based milks pull ahead, while if you’re allergic to nuts,\nalmond milk is out. For people who don’t have access \nto a wide and varied diet, dairy milk can be the most efficient\nway to get these nutrients. But all else being equal, \nany one of these four milks is nutritious enough to be part \nof a balanced diet. That’s why for many people, \nthe milk that’s best for you is actually the milk \nthat’s best for the planet. So which uses the fewest resources\nand produces the least pollution? It takes almost 4 square kilometers\nto produce just one glass of cow’s milk, land use that drives deforestation\nand habitat destruction. Most of that is land the cows live on,\nand some is used to grow their feed. Many cows eat soy beans and oats. It takes much less land to grow \nthe oats or soybeans for milk than it does to feed a dairy cow— only about a quarter square kilometer\nper glass. Almond milk has similar land use. But where that land is also matters— soybean farms are a major driver\nof deforestation, while oat and almond farms aren’t. Making milk uses water \nevery step of the way, but it’s the farming stage \nwhere big differences emerge. Dairy milk uses the most water—\nabout 120 liters per glass, mostly to water cows \nand grow their food. Almonds take second place, at more\nthan 70 liters of water per glass. Most of that water is used to grow\nalmond trees, which take years of watering before\nthey start producing almonds. The trees must be watered consistently,\nor they die, while many other crops can be\nleft fallow and still produce later. All told, soy and oats require less \nwater to grow: only about 5 to 10 liters \nper glass of milk. Milk production generates some\ngreenhouse gas emissions— about 0.1 to 0.2 kilograms per glass \nfor the plant-based milks. But for dairy milk, the cows themselves \nalso produce emissions by burping and farting out large\nquantities of the gas methane. Overall, each glass of dairy milk contributes over half a kilogram \nof greenhouse gas emissions. So while depending on your dietary\nneeds, any one of these milks may be a good\nfit, in terms of the health of our planet there’s a strong case for choosing \nplant-based milks, particularly oat or soy milk."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When making a plant-based milk, the plant source is turned into a ____ before being fortified with vitamins and minerals and diluted.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thick Paste"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Moose "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thin liquid"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which mineral does not occur naturally in plant-based milks, but is present in cow’s milk?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": " Iron"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Calcium"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Zinc"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Potassium"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "____ milk has the highest levels of carbohydrates in comparison to other pant-based milks.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Almond"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Soy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Coconut"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Oat"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How many liters of water are required to produce a glass of almond milk?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "90"}, {"label": "B", "text": "80"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70"}, {"label": "D", "text": "60"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Each glass of dairy milk contributes ____ times more greenhouse gases than plant-based milks.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Six"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Five"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Four"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Three"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

In spite of all this, its inhabitants\nbuilt the world’s first cities, with monumental architecture \nand large populations— and they built them \nentirely out of mud. Sumer occupied the southern part \nof modern Iraq in the region called Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia means “between two rivers”— the Tigris and the Euphrates. Around 5000 BCE, early Sumerians used\nirrigation channels, dams, and reservoirs to redirect river water and farm \nlarge areas of previously bone-dry land. Agricultural communities like this \nwere slowly springing up around the world. But Sumerians were the first\nto take the next step. Using clay bricks made from river mud, they began to build multi-storied\nhomes and temples. They invented the wheel— a potter’s wheel, for turning mud \ninto household goods and tools. Those clay bricks gave rise \nto the world’s first cities, probably around 4500 BCE. At the top of the city’s social ladder\nwere priests and priestesses, who were considered nobility, then merchants, craftspeople,\nfarmers, and enslaved people. The Sumerian empire \nconsisted of distinct city-states that operated like small nations. They were loosely linked \nby language and spiritual belief but lacked centralized control. The earliest cities were Uruk, \nUr, and Eridu, and eventually there were a dozen cities. Each had a king who served a role \nsomewhere between a priest and a ruler. Sometimes they fought against \neach other to conquer new territories. Each city was dedicated to a patron deity,\nconsidered the city’s founder. The largest and most important building \nin the city was this patron god’s home: the ziggurat, a temple designed\nas a stepped pyramid. Around 3200 BCE, Sumerians began \nto expand their reach. The potter’s wheel found a new home \non chariots and wagons. They built boats out of reeds \nand date palm leaves, with linen sails that carried \nthem vast distances by river and sea. To supplement scarce resources, \nthey built a trade network with the rising kingdoms in Egypt, \nAnatolia, and Ethiopia, importing gold, silver, \nlapis lazuli, and cedar wood. Trade was the unlikely impetus for the invention \nof the world’s first writing system. It started as a system of accounting\nfor Sumerian merchants conducting business with traders abroad. After a few hundred years, \nthe early pictogram system called cuneiform turned into a script. The Sumerians drafted up the first\nwritten laws and created the first school system, \ndesigned to teach the craft of writing— and pioneered some less exciting\ninnovations, like bureaucracy and taxes. In the schools, scribes studying \nfrom dawn to dusk, from childhood well into adulthood. They learned accounting, mathematics,\nand copied works of literature— hymns, myths, proverbs, animal fables, \nmagic spells, and the first epics on clay tablets. Some of those tablets told \nthe story of Gilgamesh, a king of the city of Uruk who was\nalso the subject of mythical tales. But by the third millennium BCE, Sumer\nwas no longer the only empire around, or even in Mesopotamia. Waves of nomadic tribes poured\ninto the region from the north and east. Some newcomers looked up to the Sumerians,\nadopting their way of life and using the cuneiform script \nto express their own languages. In 2300 BCE, the Akkadian king Sargon\nconquered the Sumerian city-states. But Sargon respected Sumerian culture, and Akkadians and Sumerians\nexisted side-by-side for centuries. Other invading groups focused \nonly on looting and destruction. Even as Sumerian culture spread, a steady onslaught of invasions killed\noff the Sumerian people by 1750 BCE. Afterward, Sumer disappeared \nback into the desert dirt, not to be rediscovered\nuntil the 19th century. But Sumerian culture lived \non for thousands of years— first through the Akkadians,\nthen the Assyrians, then the Babylonians. The Babylonians passed Sumerian \ninventions and traditions through along Hebrew, Greek, and Roman cultures.

We made this kindergarten \nto be a circle. It's a kind of endless circulation\non top of the roof. If you are a parent, you know that kids love\nto keep making circles. This is how the rooftop looks. And why did we design this? The principal of this kindergarten said, \"No, I don't want a handrail.\" I said, \"It's impossible.\" But he insisted: \"How about having a net\nsticking out from the edge of the roof? So that it can catch\nthe children falling off?\" (Laughter) I said, \"It's impossible.\" And of course,\nthe government official said, \"Of course you have to have a handrail.\" But we could keep \nthat idea around the trees. There are three trees popping through. And we were allowed to call \nthis rope as a handrail. But of course, rope has nothing\nto do with them. They fall into the net. And you get more, and more, more. (Laughter) Sometimes 40 children \nare around a tree. The boy on the branch, he loves the tree\nso he is eating the tree. (Laughter) And at the time of an event, they sit on the edge. It looks so nice from underneath. Monkeys in the zoo. (Laughter) Feeding time. (Laughter) \n(Applause) And we made the roof as low as possible, because we wanted to see\nchildren on top of the roof, not only underneath the roof. And if the roof is too high,\nyou see only the ceiling. And the leg washing place --\nthere are many kinds of water taps. You see with the flexible tubes, you want to spray water\nto your friends, and the shower, and the one in front is quite normal. But if you look at this, the boy is not washing his boots, he's putting water into his boots. (Laughter) This kindergarten is completely\nopen, most of the year. And there is no boundary\nbetween inside and outside. So it means basically\nthis architecture is a roof. And also there is no boundary\nbetween classrooms. So there is no acoustic barrier at all. When you put many children in a quiet box, some of them get really nervous. But in this kindergarten, there is no reason they get nervous. Because there is no boundary. And the principal says if the boy in the corner\ndoesn't want to stay in the room, we let him go. He will come back eventually,\nbecause it's a circle, it comes back. (Laughter) But the point is,\nin that kind of occasion, usually children try to hide somewhere. But here, just they leave and come back. It's a natural process. And secondly, we consider\nnoise very important. You know that children\nsleep better in noise. They don't sleep in a quiet space. And in this kindergarten, these children show\namazing concentration in class. And you know, our kind grew up\nin the jungle with noise. They need noise. And you know, you can talk\nto your friends in a noisy bar. You are not supposed to be in silence. And you know, these days we are trying to make\neverything under control. You know, it's completely open. And you should know that we can go skiing in -20 degrees in winter. In summer you go swimming. The sand is 50 degrees. And also, you should know\nthat you are waterproof. You never melt in rain. So, children are supposed to be outside. So that is how we should treat them. This is how they divide classrooms. They are supposed to help teachers. They don't. (Laughter) I didn't put him in. A classroom. And a washbasin. They talk to each other around the well. And there are always \nsome trees in the classroom. A monkey trying to fish\nanother monkey from above. (Laughter) Monkeys. (Laughter) And each classroom has\nat least one skylight. And this is where Santa Claus\ncomes down at the time of Christmas. This is the annex building, right next to that\noval-shaped kindergarten. The building is only\nfive meters tall with seven floors. And of course,\nthe ceiling height is very low. So you have to consider safety. So, we put our children,\na daughter and a son. They tried to go in. He hit his head. He's okay. His skull is quite strong. He is resilient. It's my son. (Laughter) And he is trying to see\nif it is safe to jump off. And then we put other children. The traffic jam is awful\nin Tokyo, as you know. (Laughter) The driver in front,\nshe needs to learn how to drive. Now these days, kids need a small dosage of danger. And in this kind of occasion, they learn to help each other. This is society. This is the kind of\nopportunity we are losing these days. Now, this drawing is showing\nthe movement of a boy between 9:10 and 9:30. And the circumference\nof this building is 183 meters. So it's not exactly small at all. And this boy did 6,000 meters\nin the morning. But the surprise is yet to come. The children in this kindergarten\ndo 4,000 meters on average. And these children have\nthe highest athletic abilities among many kindergartens. The principal says, \"I don't train them.\nWe leave them on top of the roof. Just like sheep.\" (Laughter) They keep running. (Laughter) My point is don't control them, don't protect them too much, and they need to tumble sometimes. They need to get some injury. And that makes them learn how to live in this world. I think architecture is capable\nof changing this world, and people's lives. And this is one of the attempts\nto change the lives of children. Thank you very much.

Horowitz", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-amazonian-myth-of-the-goblins-revenge-nathan-d-horowitz", "transcript": {"en": "Deep in the Amazon rainforest \nin the river Nea’ocoyá, lived,\naccording to Siekopai legend, a school\nof particularly big and tasty fish. When the rains came and the water rose, \nthe fish appeared, swimming away as the waters fell again. The villagers along the river reveled\nin this occasional bounty— and wanted more. They followed them upriver deep \ninto the jungle to a lagoon that thundered \nwith the sound of flapping fish. The whole village set up camp \nby the lagoon, bringing barbasco, a poison they would put\nin the water to stun the fish. Meanwhile, their young shaman took a walk. He sensed he might not be \ncompletely alone. Then, he came to a monse tree\nhumming so loudly he could hear it even above the thunder\nof the fish. With that, he was sure:\nspirits lived here. Back at camp, he warned his people \nthese fish had an owner. He would find the owner. Until he returned, no one should fish. He went to the humming tree. Inside was a hollow as big as a house,\nfull of busy weavers. Their chief invited him in, explaining that the juicy \nlittle siripia fruits were ripening, and they were weaving\nbaskets to collect them. Though they looked and acted like people, the shaman knew they were juri,\nor air goblins, who could fly and control the winds. They taught him how to weave. Before the shaman left, the goblin chief whispered \nsome cryptic instructions in his ear. Finally, he told him to tie \na pineapple shoot outside a hollow log and sleep inside that night. Back at camp, the villagers were fishing\nwith barbasco poison, cooking, and eating. Only the shaman’s little sister refrained. Then, everyone else fell\ninto a deep sleep. The shaman and his sister \nyelled and shook them, but they wouldn’t wake. It was getting dark, \nso the shaman and his sister tied the pineapple sprout outside \nthe hollow log and crawled inside. A strong wind rose—\nthe mark of the air goblins. It broke branches \nand brought down trees. Caymans, boas and jaguars roared. The water began to rise. The fish flopped off the drying racks \nand swam away. The pineapple sprout turned into a dog. All night it barked, keeping the jungle\ncreatures away from the fallen tree. When dawn broke, the flood receded. The fish were gone, \nand most of the people were, too: the jungle animals had devoured them. Only the shaman’s relatives survived. When his family turned toward him, the shaman realized what the goblins meant\nwhen they said the fruits were ripening: they weren’t really collecting \nsiripia fruits at all, but human eyes. The shaman’s older sister called him over, trying to touch his face \nwith her long, sharp nails. He backed away and, remembering \nthe goblin chief’s instructions, threw palm seeds at her face. The seeds became eyes. But then she transformed \ninto a white-lipped peccary and ran away— still alive, but no longer human. The shaman and his little sister’s \nwhole community was gone. They went to live with another village, where he taught everyone to weave baskets,\nas the air goblins had taught him. But he couldn’t forget the last \nof the goblin chief’s words, which told him how to get revenge. He returned to the air goblins’ home\ncarrying chili peppers wrapped in leaves. As the goblins watched \nthrough their peepholes, the shaman made a fire \nand put the chili peppers on it. The fire began to smoke the tree out. The goblins who had eaten \npeople’s eyes died.

Schacter", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/are-all-of-your-memories-real-daniel-l-schacter", "transcript": {"en": "In a study in the 1990s, participants recalled getting lost \nin a shopping mall as children. Some shared these memories\nin vivid detail— one even remembered that the old man\nwho rescued him was wearing a flannel shirt. But none of these people \nhad actually gotten lost in a mall. They produced these false memories when the psychologists conducting \nthe study told them they’d gotten lost, and although they might not remember\nthe incident, their parents had confirmed it. And it wasn’t just one or two people \nwho thought they remembered getting lost— a quarter of the participants did. These findings may sound unbelievable, but they actually reflect \na very common experience. Our memories are sometimes unreliable. And though we still don’t know precisely\nwhat causes this fallibility on a neurological level, research has highlighted some \nof the most common ways our memories diverge from what actually happened. The mall study highlights how we can\nincorporate information from outside sources, like other people or the news, into our personal recollections\nwithout realizing it. This kind of suggestibility is just \none influence on our memories. Take another study, in which researchers briefly showed \na random collection of photographs to a group of participants, including images of a university campus\nnone of them had ever visited. When shown the images three weeks later, a majority of participants said \nthat they had probably or definitely visited the campus in the past. The participants misattributed information\nfrom one context— an image they’d seen— onto another— a memory of something\nthey believed they actually experienced. In another experiment, people were shown\nan image of a magnifying glass, and then told to imagine a lollipop. They frequently recalled that they saw \nthe magnifying glass and the lollipop. They struggled to link the objects \nto the correct context— whether they actually saw them,\nor simply imagined them. Another study, where a psychologist \nquestioned over 2,000 people on their views about the legalization \nof marijuana, highlights yet another kind \nof influence on memory. Participants answered questions \nin 1973 and 1982. Those who said they had supported\nmarijuana legalization in 1973, but reported they were against it in 1982, were more likely to recall that they were \nactually against legalization in 1973— bringing their old views in line \nwith their current ones. Our current opinions,\nfeelings, and experiences can bias our memories \nof how we felt in the past. In another study, researchers gave two groups\nof participants background information on a historical war and asked them to rate\nthe likelihood that each side would win. They gave each group the same information, except that they only told one group\nwho had actually won the war— the other group didn’t know \nthe real world outcome. In theory, both groups’ answers \nshould be similar, because the likelihood\nof each side winning isn’t effected by who actually won— if there’s a 20% chance of thunderstorms,\nand a thunderstorm happens, the chance of thunderstorms\ndoesn’t retroactively go up to 100%. Still, the group that knew \nhow the war ended rated the winning side as more likely \nto win than the group who did not. All of these fallibilities of memory \ncan have real-world impacts. If police interrogations use leading\nquestions with eye witnesses or suspects, suggestibility could result in incorrect \nidentifications or unreliable confessions. Even in the absence of leading questions, misattribution can lead to inaccurate \neyewitness testimony. In a courtroom, if a judge rules a piece of evidence \ninadmissible and tells jurors to disregard it,\nthey may not be able to do so. In a medical setting, if a patient \nseeks a second opinion and the second physician is aware \nof the first one’s diagnosis, that knowledge may bias their conclusion. Our memories are not ironclad \nrepresentations of reality, but subjective perceptions. And there’s not necessarily\nanything wrong with that— the problems arise when we treat\nmemory as fact, rather than accepting\nthis fundamental truth about the nature of our recollections."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In the ‘lost-in-the-mall’ study, what percentage of participants generated false memories of being lost in a mall when they were children?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "25"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50"}, {"label": "D", "text": "90"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The “lost in the mall” study provides an example of memory distortion due to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Forgetting"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Absent-mindedness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Psychosis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Suggestibility"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "After seeing a magnifying glass and imagining a lollipop, on a subsequent memory test, people:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sometimes remembered seeing both the magnifying glass and lollipop"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Always remembered seeing both the magnifying glass and lollipop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Never remembered seeing the lollipop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Always remembered seeing both the magnifying glass and lollipop"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "People who said they supported marijuana legalization in 1973 and were against it in 1982, were likely to say in 1982 that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They supported marijuana legalization in 1973"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They forgot whether they supported marijuana in 1973"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They were against marijuana legalization in 1973"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They had no position on marijuana legalization in 1973"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Being given information about the outcome of an event:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Biases our retroactive estimates of how the event will turn out to fit the outcome"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Has no impact on our retroactive estimates of how the event will turn out"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Biases our retroactive estimates of how the event will turn out in the opposite direction of the outcome"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Makes us forget details of the event"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

His research led to what we know \ntoday as the taste map: an illustration that divides the tongue \ninto four separate areas. According to this map, receptors at the tip of our tongues\ncapture sweetness, bitterness \nis detected at the tongue’s base, and along the sides, receptors capture \nsalty and sour sensations. Since its invention, the taste map \nhas been published in textbooks and newspapers. The only problem with this map, \nis that it’s wrong. In fact, it’s not even \nan accurate representation of what Hänig originally discovered. The tongue map is a common misconception— something widely believed \nbut largely incorrect. So where do misconceptions \nlike this come from, and what makes a fake fact \nso easy to believe? It’s true that the tongue map’s \njourney begins with David Hänig. As part of his dissertation \nat Leipzig University, Hänig analyzed taste sensitivities across \nthe tongue for the four basic flavors. Using sucrose for sweet, \nquinine sulfate for bitter, hydrochloric acid for sour, \nand salt for salty, Hänig applied these stimuli to compare \ndifferences in taste thresholds across a subject’s tongue. He hoped to better understand \nthe physiological mechanisms that affected these four flavors, and his data suggested that sensitivity \nfor each taste did in fact vary across the tongue. The maximum sensation for sweet \nwas located at the tongue’s tip; bitter flavors were strongest at the back;\nsalt was strongest in this area, and sour at the middle \nof the tongue’s sides. But Hänig was careful \nto note that every sensation could also be tasted across the tongue, and that the areas he identified offered \nvery small variations in intensity. Like so many misconceptions, the tongue map represents a distortion \nof its original source, however the nature of that distortion \ncan vary. Some misconceptions \nare comprised of disinformation— false information intentionally designed \nto mislead people. But many misconceptions, \nincluding the tongue map, center on misinformation—\nfalse or misleading information that results from unintentional \ninaccuracy. Misinformation is most often shaped \nby mistakes and human error, but the specific mistakes \nthat lead to a misconception can be surprisingly varied. In the case of the tongue map, Hänig’s dissertation was written \nin German, meaning the paper could only be \nunderstood by readers fluent in German and well versed in Hanig’s \nsmall corner of academia. This kicked off a game of telephone \nthat re-shaped Häing’s research every time it was shared \nwith outside parties. Less than a decade after his dissertation, newspapers were falsely insisting \nthat experiments could prove sweetness was imperceptible \non the back of the tongue. The second culprit \nbehind the tongue map’s spread were the images \nthat Hänig’s work inspired. In 1912, a rough version of the map \nappeared in a newspaper article that cautiously described \nsome of the mysteries behind taste and smell research. Featuring clear labels across the tongue,\nthe article’s illustration simplified Hänig’s more-complicated \noriginal diagrams. Variations of this approachable image \nbecame repeatedly cited, often without credit or nuanced \nconsideration for Hänig’s work. Eventually this image spread \nto textbooks and classrooms as a purported truth \nof how we experience taste. But perhaps the factor that most \ncontributed to this misconception was its narrative simplicity. In many ways, the map complements our desire for clear \nstories about the world around us— a quality not always present \nin the sometimes-messy fields of science. For example, even the number of tastes we have is more \ncomplicated than Hänig’s work suggests. Umami— also known as savory— \nis now considered the fifth basic taste, and many still debate \nthe existence of tastes like fatty, alkaline, metallic, \nand water-like. Once we hear a good story, it can be difficult to change \nhow we see that information, even in the face of new evidence. So, next time you see a convenient chart \nor read a surprising anecdote, try to maintain a healthy skepticism— because misconceptions \ncan leave a bitter taste on every part of your tongue."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where on the tongue can sweetness be tasted?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "On the tip of the tongue"}, {"label": "B", "text": "On the back of the tongue"}, {"label": "C", "text": "At the sides of the tongue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the difference between misinformation from disinformation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Misinformation is usually accidental, while disinformation is purposeful"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Disinformation is usually accidental, while misinformation is purposeful"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Disinformation is always false while misinformation can sometimes be true"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is no difference between them"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following was a factor in the tongue map’s spread?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The uncredited illustrations that Hänig’s findings inspired"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The faulty research used by Hänig in his study"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A mistranslation of Hänig’s work from the original French"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Errors with Hänig’s original illustrations"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "____ is considered by many to be the fifth basic taste?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Metallic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fatty"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Umami"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Water-like"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the total number of tastes that humans have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "9"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Unknown"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Pappas", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-rise-of-modern-populism-takis-s-pappas", "transcript": {"en": "In the mid-1970s, after decades \nof political turmoil, Greece finally seemed \nto be on the path to stability. With the introduction \nof a new constitution and negotiations underway \nto enter European institutions, many analysts expected Greek politics to follow the pattern \nof the larger Western world. Then in 1981, a political party \ncalled PASOK came to power. Its charismatic leader Andreas Papandreou\nrailed against the new constitution, and accused those in power \nof “national betrayal.” Opposing Greece’s membership in NATO\nand the European Economic Community, Papandreou promised to govern \nfor the betterment of the “common people\" above all else. He famously declared, “there are \nno institutions, only the people exist.” Papandreou’s rise to power \nisn’t a unique story. In many democratic countries \naround the world, charismatic leaders vilify \npolitical opponents, disparage institutions,\nand claim the mantle of the people. Some critics label this approach\nas authoritarian or fascist, and many argue that these leaders \nare using emotions to manipulate and deceive voters. But whether or not this style of politics\nis ethical, it's certainly democratic, and it goes by the name of populism. The term populism has been around\nsince Ancient Rome, and has its roots in the Latin word \n“populus” meaning “the people.\" But since then populism has been used \nto describe dozens of political movements, often with counterintuitive and sometimes\ncontradictory goals. Populist movements have rebelled \nagainst monarchies, monopolies, and a wide variety \nof powerful institutions. It’s not possible to cover \nthe full history of this term here. Instead, we’re focusing \non one specific type of populism— the kind that describes \nPapandreou’s administration and numerous other governments \nover the last 70 years: modern populism. But to understand how political theorists\ndefine this phenomenon we first need to explore \nwhat it’s responding to. In the aftermath of World War Two, many countries wanted to move away \nfrom totalitarian ideologies. They sought a new political system that prioritized individual \nand social rights, aimed at political consensus, \nand respected the rule of law. As a result, most Western nations adopted\na longstanding form of government called liberal democracy. In this context, “liberal” \ndoesn’t refer to any political party, but rather a type of democracy \nthat has three essential components. First, liberal democracies accept \nthat society is full of many, often crosscutting \ndivisions that generate conflict. Second, it requires that society’s \nmany factions seek common ground \nacross those divisions. Finally, liberal democracies rely \non the rule of law and the protection of minority rights, as specified in constitutions\nand legal statutes. Taken together, these ideals propose that tolerance and institutions \nthat protect us from intolerance, are the bedrock of a functional \nand diverse democratic society. Liberal democracies helped bring stability\nto the nations that adopted them. But like any system of government, \nthey didn’t solve everything. Among other issues, \nan ever-increasing wealth gap led to underserved communities who distrusted both their wealthy \nneighbors and their political leaders. In some cases, political corruption\nfurther damaged the public's trust. Growing suspicion and resentment \naround these politicians primed citizens to look \nfor a new kind of leader who would challenge \nestablished institutions and put the needs of the people first. In many ways, this reaction \nhighlights democracy in action: if the majority of a population feels\ntheir interests are underrepresented, they can elect leaders to change \nthat using existing democratic systems. But this is where assertive, modern \npopulist candidates can subvert democracy. Modern populists identify themselves \nas embodying the \"will of the people,\" and they place those interests above the institutions \nthat protect individual and social rights. Modern populists argue \nthese institutions are run by a self-serving ruling minority, who seek to control the vast majority\nof virtuous common people. As a result, politics is no longer about\nseeking compromise and consensus through tolerant democratic institutions. Instead, these leaders seek to overturn\nwhat they see as a broken system. This means that where a liberal democracy\nhas the utmost respect for institutions like courtrooms, free press, \nand national constitutions, modern populists disparage \nany establishment that disagrees with the so-called “common will.\" Modern populist parties \nhave arisen in many places, but the leaders of these movements\nare remarkably similar. They’re often charismatic individuals who identify themselves as embodying \nthe “will of the people.\" They make exorbitant promises \nto their supporters, while casting their opponents as traitors\nactively undermining the country. But whether these politicians are sincere\nbelievers or manipulative opportunists, the dynamics they unleash can be profoundly destabilizing\nfor liberal democracy. Even when modern populist leaders \ndon’t follow through with their most extreme promises, their impact on political discourse, \nthe rule of law, and public trust can long outlast their time in office."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The root of the word “populism” is in", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "populus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "pleb"}, {"label": "C", "text": "demos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "folk"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Modern populism prioritizes the people’s interests over", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "global capitalism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "state arbitrariness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "social anarchy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "political institutions"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The polar opposite of modern populism is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "authoritarian state"}, {"label": "B", "text": "liberal democracy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "traditional politics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "monarchical regime"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The successful rise of populism mostly depends on the availability of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "economic and political crisis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "charismatic leadership"}, {"label": "C", "text": "political scandals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "global affairs"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "“Liberal democracy” is a", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "bygone philosophical doctrine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "certain political party ideology"}, {"label": "C", "text": "set of ideas about how to constitute modern democracy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "utopian dream"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
