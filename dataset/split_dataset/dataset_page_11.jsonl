{"page": 11, "lesson": 2, "title": "How do you teach empathy? - Jonathan Juravich", "category": "Teaching Strategies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/hYl7p8BU", "transcript": {"en": "I grew up with two working parents, and their schedules didn’t often align– so my brother and I would spend \nafternoons and long summer days at my grandparents’ house. This was a place where you were sure to \nput things back where they belonged and didn't leave objects out on the floor. It wasn't because my grandparents \nwere strict. My grandmother, Josie, was blind. And if we messed with that order, and didn't put things back\nwhere they belonged, it could cause confusion, frustration, or even physical harm. I remember as a kid trying to understand\nwhat it would be like to navigate spaces without my sense of sight. I would close my eyes real tight, and I would try to remember the way my\ngrandparents’ living room looked– I walked with my small hands \noutstretched in front of me– until I ran into a chair, and then a \nlamp, and then the wall. It was in that moment that \nI was in awe of her. On the occasion that my brother and I \nwould be spending the entire day at my grandparents' house, we would bring along our VHS tapes, you know pre-DVD or streaming service? And many, if not all of those tapes were \nDisney movies– we were American children \nof the late 80s early 90s. We would sit on that bright red \ncarpet staring up at their large TV housed in an even larger \nentertainment center. In between preparing meals, my grandmother would come in and she'd sit\ndown in her recliner, and she'd say, “Tell me about \nyour stories,” referencing the action taking place \non the screen. Aladdin was one of our favorites\nto enjoy together. I would describe the desert backgrounds, the clothing on the characters, \nthe expressions on their faces. I can recall her smile as I described a \n“whole new world” and that magic carpet ride \nthrough the clouds. I wanted her to feel included, \nto be a part of what we were watching. And those thoughts were a \nresponse to my feelings of empathy. I had this unique childhood where I was \nlearning about empathy through my relationship with my\ngrandmother… through our watching of Disney movies. But I know not everyone has an\nexperience like that. But I believe that it is important \nand crucial that we provide our children with \nopportunities to have relationships that foster \nempathetic connections. Now as a quick aside, I know the word\nempathy comes with its own baggage. Maybe in your circles it's a word that's\nthrown around so much that you're sick of hearing about it, or it's lost its meaning altogether. Or, maybe you've heard it said that\nempathy is a “soft skill” that needs to be shared with our students. I attest that there is nothing “soft” \nor mooshy about it. Instead, it is a critical \nskill to be honed as we learn what it means to be human. I'm an elementary art educator. I teach my students about \nartists, culture, and the purposeful use of art materials. But I also see it as my role \nto engage them in conversations about \ncharacter education, and specifically empathy. But how do we often define empathy\nto our youngest children? Think about it. Often times you might use the... “Walk in someone else’s shoes.” Sure that works as a metaphor, but now I want you to put yourself in the\nmind of a kindergartner. A kindergartner that might go, \"Why am I putting on someone else’s\nshoes!?” That is weird to them, they don’t understand the language we're\nusing for this really important topic. And even a simplified definition such as “understanding and sharing the feelings of\nothers” is really hard to internalize \nas a 5-year-old. So instead, very purposeful conversations\nabout practical, observable behaviors is necessary. How do I show empathy in the classroom, \nat the park with my friends, to my grandmother, to someone that looks\ndifferently than me, to someone that acts differently than me…? A year ago, I was sitting around with my\ncolleagues at school, and we were talking about \ncharacter education. We were developing a\nschool-wide curriculum, and we went around and around \nabout definitions and explanations. And then one summer night, \nit hit those of us in the room– our eyes were opened to the fact, that the\nroot of empathy lies in awareness. Awareness: “a noticing of what is \nhappening in and around you so that you can make a choice.” You can have a response, have \nan empathetic response. But first, we have to have an \nawareness of ourselves. I'm the grocery shopper in our family. I take my list and enjoy the thrill of the\nhunt as I try to stay below budget, which I mostly do. And one week I was notified\nthat we needed new napkins. And I came upon these \nillustrated beauties. They're conversation napkins. And we got a real kick out of them\nas we went around the table. Every night, we would go around\nat dinner time and answer them, and have fun, and laugh together. But it really got me thinking about a very\npurposeful teaching opportunity I had with my own family. And so, I thought, we often times \ntalk about our feelings \"I'm happy,\" \"I'm sad,\" but do we spend time together \ntalking about why we feel that way? And so I've gotten into the practice of \nasking my 5-year-old daughter about her day at school in this way: I say, “Tell me about a part of your\nday when you were proud. Tell me about a part of your day \nwhen you were frustrated. Tell me about a part of your day \nwhen you were really excited.” Different nights I may ask about a \ndifferent emotion, a different feeling. My favorite, \"Tell me about \na part of your day where you laughed so hard \nyou fell on the floor.\" And I'm also sure as the adult, \nto tell her that I too, in that day, had moments \nwhere I was scared, and moments that I was proud, and definitely moments where I laughed\nso hard that I fell on the floor. But you see, she's quick. \nShe's real quick. And one day, I said, “Tell me about a \npart of your day when you were sad.\" And she said, \"Well I wasn't sad, but my friend Ellie was sad when she \ndidn’t get to play with the magnatiles.” See, the observed behaviors and \nfeelings of others have become a part of who she is as\na person, and as a friend. And it all leads us to having \nan awareness of others. I was teaching a unit on architecture when Hurricane Harvey hit Houston. And it was to my fourth graders, and I had several fourth grade \nstudents come to class asking questions about how this natural disaster would affect the buildings in the city. And they were asking these questions,\nthey led us to other conversations and soon we were talking \nabout how the elements would affect the lives \nof the people there. Soon the whole class was in conversation,\nand I sat back and listened, as I watched them turn the story into \nabout the art room of the students in Houston, and watching them almost see themselves\nin that place, to then begin having conversations about\nwhat would happen to the art supplies, and the furniture, and all of the art work\nthat they had spent their time on. As I listened, I wanted\nto provide them with another opportunity, a way to artistically process the thoughts\nand the feelings that they had. So, what I did is I introduced them to\ntwo artists that cover items, and rooms, \nand actual houses with polka dots. What these artists are doing is talking\nabout our unity, about trauma, about community. And as a result, we created this\n5 foot tall house structure. Now there's a lot more here than just \nplayful polka dots– each of those dots represents \nan art supply that a fourth grade student donated\nto a school in Houston. See it wasn't health supplies, or food, \nbut it was art supplies. It had become very real to them. The idea that our room, our art room is a\nsafe place where they learn about themselves, \nabout community, about the world, all while having fun. And the idea that there'd be \nchildren in Houston that maybe miss out\non those opportunities really resonated with them. It became real to them. See these thoughts, these \nfeelings of empathy, led to practical practice... Their awareness led to practical practice. I no longer sit on the floor in front my\ngrandmother watching Disney movies. Those days are long gone. But now, I sit on the floor next to my\n5-year-old daughter, also named Josie. We watch as Aladdin and Jasmine take \nflight on the magic carpet. And there's this moment where the\ncarpet takes a deep dive and Princess Jasmine braces herself in \nfear by covering her eyes with her hands. As she does so on the screen, \nso does my 5-year-old daughter. She is experiencing empathy \nfor this animated princess, she's experiencing fear along with her. But it’s then that Aladdin responds \nto Jasmine and he says, “Don’t you dare close your eyes” \nand he pulls her hands from her face, opening her eyes to the experiences \naround her. And as he does, so do I with \nmy 5-year-old daughter. I pull her fingers from her face. May we open our children’s eyes to the \nworld around them to engage them in opportunities, thoughts,\nactions, and relationships, that get them to not only “walk in someone\nelse’s shoes” but to live lives that consider others\nmore than themselves.

As gentle\nas sunlight, as tenacious\nas hale, in its route to the heart,\nit could not but prevail. And the people looked up\nfrom their day-to-day tasks, their day-to-day jobs and their \nday-to-day masks.

And once they could see it,\nthey hadn't a chance To resist the \nsweet song of the deep spell\nit cast.

It’s a still morning–\nunusually still, and the lack of wind is the latest \nin a series of troubling signs. The year is 1400 BCE. Quexo’s village sits in the dusty, \ntreeless desert between the towering Andes \nand Pacific Ocean. The villagers live off the sea, \nharvesting reeds, drying them in the sun, \nand using them to build fishing boats. Every day in the summer, the men set out on these boats\nto hunt shark and other fish while the women harvest \nshellfish and sea urchins. In winter, storms bring powerful waves,\nwhich cross the vast ocean unobstructed to detonate on these shores. Most years, Quexo’s village catches \nmore than enough fish. But this year, the winds have died \nand the fish have dwindled. Quexo has seen this pattern before: the fish disappear, \nthen the violent rains arrive, causing flash floods that dissolve \nmud bricks and wash away settlements. He needs to stop the bad weather \nbefore the storms come— his only hope is a special ritual \nhe’s been planning. Quexo spends much less time\nin the ocean than the other villagers. He became a shaman after seeing \na sign in the sea one morning— like his father and grandfather\nbefore him. This morning, he walks to the nearby sacred mountain \nas the sun rises. There, he gathers ceremonial cactus \nand herbs like “horse tail,” “stonebreaker,\" and valerian, \nalong with the mineral hematite. Back in the village, \neveryone is preparing to leave for a religious festival \nat a large temple inland. The festival marks the beginning of what\nis usually the season of abundance, but with the signs pointing to storms,\nQuexo isn’t feeling too celebratory. Whole families travel to the festival,\nwhere they camp for a few days. They’ve packed seaweed, carved bones,\ngourd bowls, reed mats, and other goods to trade \nin the market around the temple. Quexo inspects the goods to make \nsure everything is of the finest quality. He brings the herbs he gathered \nto trade for cinnabar, a mineral that comes \nfrom the highlands in the Andes. He needs cinnabar for his ritual \nto ward off the storms. Around lunchtime, the sprawling \ntemple rises out of the desert ahead. People have come from all along \nthe coast and the foothills. The women handle trade transactions—\nthey’re looking for cotton and ceramics. Men aren’t usually allowed \nto do the trading, but shamans are an exception. Though Quexo is a man, during rituals \nhe becomes half man, half woman, and this ambiguity makes his role \nmore flexible outside ceremonies too. Quexo can’t find any cinnabar \nin the market, so he heads to the main temple, dodging children playing in the plaza. He puts on his ceremonial garb: \nred face paint, earrings, and a necklace of shark’s teeth\nand vertebrae. Inside, the ceremonies \nare already underway, and the shamans have drunk\nthe sacred cactus drink. Many of them are Quexo’s friends \nfrom festivals over the years, but he doesn’t see the mountain shamans \nwho would have cinnabar. He begins to panic. If the highland shamans don’t show up, his only option will be to make \nthe long walk into the mountains. It’s a dangerous journey \nthat takes five days, precious time he doesn’t have to waste. But perhaps he has no choice. He refuses the sacred cactus \nand sets off toward the mountains. As he leaves the settlement behind,\nhe sees a group approaching. He recognizes them as highlanders\nby their llamas. He dashes toward their shaman. Barely pausing to say hello, \nhe offers him hematite, dried seaweed, and empty shells to grind up for lime\nand chew with coca leaves. In return, the other shaman \ngives him the precious cinnabar. With the key to his ritual in hand, Quexo heads home to the temple \nof the fisherman in hopes of turning the tide."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Cinnabar was exploited by ancient Peruvians in_______ mines", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Coastal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Amazonian"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Highlan"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Cinnabar was found by ancient Peruvians in_______ mines", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Coastal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Amazonian"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Highland"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Glaciers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Quexo lived in a__________", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Farming village"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fishing village"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Herding village"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Desert"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The story refers to a potential___________ about to occur in the region", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Storms, rains and floods"}, {"label": "B", "text": "War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Earthquake"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tsunami"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The annual festivals where performed in_____________", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The village"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the woods"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the middle of the desert"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In the inland ceremonial centers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "From whom the shaman got the cinnabar mineral?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Local shamans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Traders living around the pyramids of the ceremonial centers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Shamans from the highlands"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Women living in the upper highlands"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

We were just practicing\nour sad faces. Ooo, good one, Squeaks! Chances are you can’t look any more miserable\nthan this deep-sea creature: Meet the blobfish! It’s got a pretty good reason to look so\nbummed. It’s been called the world’s ugliest animal. Which really isn’t a nice thing to say. I mean, it might not be as cute as a panda\nor a kitten, but the blobfish’s funny-looking body actually helps it to survive in its harsh\nunderwater environment. The blobfish lives in the ocean off the coast\nof Australia. And it lives really, really deep. How deep? Almost at the sea floor -- that’s\nnearly 10 times deeper than where most ocean animals live. Not many animals could survive where the blobfish\nlives. Down there, it’s pitch-black because sunlight\ncan’t even reach that far; the temperature is just a few degrees above freezing; and\nthe pressure is extremely high. So what’s this pressure we’re talking\nabout? Well, if you’re at the bottom of the ocean, the weight of alllll the water\non top of you presses down really hard. And it squeezes you -- like a really, really tight\nbear hug! So how does the blobfish survive with all\nthis intense pressure? Well, that’s where its “ugliness” is actually a plus! The blobfish has a gooey, jelly-like body\nthat can handle the squeezing from all of that underwater pressure. In fact, it has almost no muscle, and very\nfew bones. It’s almost pure squish! But it’s still able to do things like move\nand eat, because its blobbiness makes it buoyant. And this means it can just float comfortably\nright above the ocean floor without having to use too much energy to swim. And it mostly just swallows food that happens\nto float on by. Which I have to admit would be pretty neat.\nCould you imagine cheeseburgers just floating into your mouth?! So the blobfish is blobby for a lot of good\nreasons. And to its underwater friends, it probably doesn’t look so ugly at all. Scientists actually think that -- when it’s\nat home on the ocean floor -- the blobfish probably looks more like the other fish that\nwe know. That’s because the pressure at the bottom of the ocean squeezes its body\ninto that shape. But most of the blobfish that we've seen have\nbeen caught by fishing nets, and brought up out of the ocean. And when a blobfish is taken away from the\npressure that gives its body that shape, well, it looks blobbier than usual. So is the blobfish really ugly? Well, maybe\nto some people. Is it awesome?

A room papered \nfloor to ceiling with bridal satins. The lid of an immense snuffbox. These seemingly unrelated images \ntake us on a tour of a sperm whale’s head in Herman Melville’s \"Moby Dick.\" On the surface, the book is the story of Captain Ahab’s \nhunt for revenge against Moby Dick, the white whale who bit off his leg. But though the book features pirates,\ntyphoons, high-speed chases, and giant squid, you shouldn’t expect a conventional \nseafaring adventure. Instead, it’s a multilayered exploration \nof not only the intimate details of life aboard a whaling ship, but also subjects from across \nhuman and natural history, by turns playful and tragic, \nhumorous, and urgent. The narrator guiding us through \nthese explorations is a common sailor called Ishmael. Ishmael starts out telling his own story as he prepares to escape the “damp \nand drizzly November in [his] soul” by going to sea. But after he befriends \nthe Pacific Islander Queequeg and joins Ahab’s crew aboard the Pequod, Ishmael becomes more \nof an omniscient guide for the reader than a traditional character. While Ahab obsesses over revenge and first mate Starbuck \ntries to reason with him, Ishmael takes us \non his own quest for meaning throughout “the whole universe, \nnot excluding its suburbs.” In his telling, life’s biggest questions \nloom large, even in the smallest details. Like his narrator, Melville \nwas a restless and curious spirit, who gained an unorthodox education\nworking as a sailor on a series of grueling voyages \naround the world in his youth. He published \"Moby Dick\" in 1851, when the United States’ \nwhaling industry was at its height. Nantucket, where the Pequod sets sail, was the epicenter of this lucrative \nand bloody global industry which decimated the world’s \nwhale populations. Unusually for his time, Melville doesn’t shy away \nfrom the ugly side of this industry, even taking the whale’s perspective \nat one point, when he speculates on how terrifying \nthe huge shadows of the ships must be to the creature swimming below. The author’s first-hand familiarity \nwith whaling is evident over and over again\nin Ishmael’s vivid descriptions. In one chapter, \nthe skin of a whale’s penis becomes protective clothing \nfor a crewman. Chapters with titles as unpromising \nas “Cistern and Buckets” become some of the novel’s \nmost rewarding as Ishmael compares bailing out \na sperm-whale’s head to midwifery, which leads to reflections on Plato. Tangling whale-lines provoke \nwitty reflections on the “ever-present perils” \nentangling all mortals. He draws on diverse branches of knowledge,\nlike zoology, gastronomy, law, economics, mythology, and teachings from a range \nof religious and cultural traditions. The book experiments with writing style \nas much as subject matter. In one monologue, Ahab challenges \nMoby Dick in Shakespearean style: “Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying \nbut unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; \nfrom hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit \nmy last breath at thee.” One chapter is written as a playscript, where members of the Pequod’s multi-ethnic\ncrew chime in individually and in chorus. African and Spanish sailors trade insults \nwhile a Tahitian seaman longs for home, Chinese and Portuguese crewmembers \ncall for a dance, and one young boy prophesies disaster. In another chapter, Ishmael sings the process \nof decanting whale oil in epic style, as the ship pitches and rolls \nin the midnight sea and the casks rumble like landslides. A book so wide-ranging \nhas something for everyone. Readers have found \nreligious and political allegory, existential enquiry, \nsocial satire, economic analysis, and representations \nof American imperialism, industrial relations and racial conflict. As Ishmael chases meaning \nand Ahab chases the white whale, the book explores the opposing forces \nof optimism and uncertainty, curiosity and fear that characterize \nhuman existence no matter what it is we’re chasing. Through \"Moby Dick’s\" many pages, Melville invites his readers \nto leap into the unknown, to join him on the hunt \nfor the “ungraspable phantom of life.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is not mentioned in Moby-Dick?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a giant squid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the Gettysburg Address"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Plato"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nantucket"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following reasons does Ishmael provide for his decision to go to sea?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a desire to avenge himself on Captain Ahab"}, {"label": "B", "text": "a desire to escape a “damp, drizzly November” in his soul"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a wish to befriend the Pacific Islander, Queequeg"}, {"label": "D", "text": "his ambition to save the whales from destruction"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to the lesson, which of the following does Moby-Dick include?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "dialogue in the form of a playscript"}, {"label": "B", "text": "tragic and comic elements"}, {"label": "C", "text": "experiments with literary style"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following most accurately describes the Pequod’s crew?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "they come from different ethnic backgrounds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "they rebel against Captain Ahab"}, {"label": "C", "text": "they avoid contact with Ishmael"}, {"label": "D", "text": "they perform one of Shakespeare’s plays"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where was the United States’ whaling industry based?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hawaii"}, {"label": "B", "text": "New Orleans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "New England"}, {"label": "D", "text": "San Francisco"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

{"page": 11, "lesson": 23, "title": "How do ventilators work? - Alex Gendler", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-ventilators-work-alex-gendler", "transcript": {"en": "In the 16th century, Flemish physician \nAndreas Vesalius described how a suffocating animal \ncould be kept alive by inserting a tube into its trachea\nand blowing air to inflate its lungs. In 1555, this procedure didn’t warrant\nmuch acclaim. But today, Vesalius’s treatise \nis recognized as the first description \nof mechanical ventilation— a crucial practice in modern medicine. To appreciate the value of ventilation, we need to understand how \nthe respiratory system works. We breathe by contracting our diaphragms, \nwhich expands our chest cavities. This allows air to be drawn in, \ninflating the alveoli— millions of small sacs inside our lungs. Each of these tiny balloons is surrounded \nby a mesh of blood-filled capillaries. This blood absorbs oxygen \nfrom the inflated alveoli and leaves behind carbon dioxide. When the diaphragm is relaxed, the CO2 is exhaled alongside \na mix of oxygen and other gases. When our respiratory systems \nare working correctly, this process happens automatically. But the respiratory system can be \ninterrupted by a variety of conditions. Sleep apnea stops diaphragm muscles\nfrom contracting. Asthma can lead to inflamed airways \nwhich obstruct oxygen. And pneumonia, often triggered \nby bacterial or viral infections, attacks the alveoli themselves. Invading pathogens kill lung cells, triggering an immune response \nthat can cause lethal inflammation and fluid buildup. All these situations render the lungs \nunable to function normally. But mechanical ventilators \ntake over the process, getting oxygen into the body \nwhen the respiratory system cannot. These machines can bypass \nconstricted airways, and deliver highly oxygenated air \nto help damaged lungs diffuse more oxygen. There are two main ways \nventilators can work— pumping air into the patient’s lungs \nthrough positive pressure ventilation, or allowing air to be passively drawn \nin through negative pressure ventilation. In the late 19th century, ventilation techniques largely \nfocused on negative pressure, which closely approximates \nnatural breathing and provides an even distribution \nof air in the lungs. To achieve this, doctors created \na tight seal around the patient’s body, either by enclosing them in \na wooden box or a specially sealed room. Air was then pumped \nout of the chamber, decreasing air pressure,\nand allowing the patient’s chest cavity to expand more easily. In 1928, doctors developed \na portable, metal device with pumps powered \nby an electric motor. This machine, known as the iron lung, became a fixture in hospitals \nthrough the mid-20th century. However, even the most compact \nnegative pressure designs heavily restricted a patient’s movement and obstructed access for caregivers. This led hospitals in the 1960’s to shift \ntowards positive pressure ventilation. For milder cases, \nthis can be done non-invasively. Often, a facemask is fitted \nover the mouth and nose, and filled with pressurized air \nwhich moves into the patient’s airway. But more severe circumstances require a device that takes over \nthe entire breathing process. A tube is inserted \ninto the patient’s trachea to pump air directly into the lungs, with a series of valves \nand branching pipes forming a circuit for inhalation \nand exhalation. In most modern ventilators, an embedded computer system allows for monitoring the patient’s \nbreathing and adjusting the airflow. These machines aren’t used \nas a standard treatment, but rather, as a last resort. Enduring this influx of pressurized air \nrequires heavy sedation, and repeated ventilation \ncan cause long-term lung damage. But in extreme situations, ventilators can be the difference \nbetween life and death. And events like the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that they’re even more \nessential than we thought. Because current models \nare bulky, expensive, and require extensive training to operate,\nmost hospitals only have a few in supply. This may be enough \nunder normal circumstances, but during emergencies, \nthis limited cache is stretched thin.

{"page": 11, "lesson": 24, "title": "Why can't dogs eat chocolate?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/7gp1rciv", "transcript": {"en": "♪ INTRO ♪ If you have a dog, you’ve probably heard that chocolate will make your pet sick. And that also applies to other pets, like cats, rats, and mice. But that just doesn’t seem fair. Why do we get to go to town on a giant bar of dark chocolate, but Fido shouldn’t even have one bite? It all has to do with a molecule called theobromine, which is made up of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms, and, along with its partner caffeine, is one of many reasons humans have loved chocolate for thousands of years. Both molecules are dangerous for dogs, but chocolate contains a lot more theobromine than it does caffeine, so it’s the molecule to watch out for. Like caffeine, theobromine is a type of alkaloid, which is a huge class of molecules that generally contain rings with at least one nitrogen atom in them. And alkaloids often have physiological effects on humans and other animals. Also like caffeine, theobromine makes our hearts pump faster, our blood vessels dilate, and some of our muscles get more energy, which sounds great! But too much of it can make our hearts pump too quickly and our muscles contract uncontrollably, eventually leading to nausea, convulsions, heart attack, and even death. Luckily for our taste buds, we humans process theobromine pretty quickly, so that’s not something you have to worry about. It rarely sticks around for long enough to cause any harm. But our pets aren’t so lucky: They process theobromine a lot more slowly, so it can easily build up and cause those dangerous effects. It’s hard to know exactly why we evolved to be better at digesting theobromine, but it might be because alkaloids mostly come from plants, and our ancestors ate a lot more plants than early cats and dogs did. Whatever the reason, the same amount of theobromine stays in pets’ bodies much longer, giving it more time to pile up and cause harm. On top of that, most pets are a lot lighter than humans, so it really doesn’t take much chocolate to make them sick. Cats don’t often get poisoned from chocolate because they can’t taste sweet things, so they’re generally not too interested in it. But dogs sure are! Your average adult human would need to eat about eight kilograms of dark chocolate to get a lethal dose of theobromine, but a medium-sized dog would only need to eat about one kilogram, and a house cat would need only a tenth of a kilogram. Sweeter chocolates have less theobromine, so the lethal dose is higher: about five kilograms of milk chocolate for dogs and about a third of a kilogram for cats. But they’d be sick long before eating that much. Meanwhile, you and I would have to eat about half of our body weight in milk chocolate for a lethal dose. Which might sound wonderful, but I don’t want to see any of you writing “challenge accepted” in the comments, because you’d be very sick way before finishing that much chocolate. Among other things, I’m trying very hard not to picture what it would do to your digestive system. But the next time you decide to indulge in a chocolate bar or three, just keep it to yourself, no matter how long your dog gives you those adorable puppy eyes.
