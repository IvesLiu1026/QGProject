How have they survived so long? - David Gruber", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/jellyfish-predate-dinosaurs-how-have-they-survived-so-long-david-gruber", "transcript": {"en": "Some are longer than a blue whale. Others are barely larger \nthan a grain of sand. One species unleashes one of\nthe most deadly venoms on Earth. Another holds a secret that's behind some \nof the greatest breakthroughs in biology. They've inhabited the ocean for at least\nhalf a billion years, and they're still flourishing as the sea\nchanges around them. Jellyfish are soft-bodied sea creatures\nthat aren't really fish. They're part of a diverse team\nof gelatinous zooplankton, zooplankton being animals that drift\nin the ocean. There are more than 1,000 species\nof jellyfish, and many others \nthat are often mistaken for them. A noted feature of jellyfish \nis a translucent bell made of a soft delicate material\ncalled mesoglea. Sandwiched between two layers of skin, the mesoglea is more than 95% water\nheld together by protein fibers. The jellyfish can contract and \nrelax their bells to propel themselves. They don't have a brain or a spinal cord, but a neural net around the bell's\ninner margin forms a rudimentary nervous system that can sense the ocean's currents\nand the touch of other animals. Jellyfish don't have typical \ndigestive systems, either. These gelatinous carnivores consume \nplankton and other small sea creatures through a hole in the underside \nof their bells. The nutrients are absorbed by\nan inner layer of cells with waste excreted back through\ntheir mouths. But the jellyfish's relatively \nsimple anatomy doesn't prevent it from having\nsome remarkable abilities. One kind of box jellyfish has 24 eyes. Scientists think it can see color and form\nimages within its simple nervous system. Four of its eyes are curved \nupward on stalks. This allows the jellyfish to peer\nthrough the surface of the water, looking for the canopy \nof the mangrove trees where it feeds. In fact, this may be one \nof the only creatures with a 360-degree view of its environment. The jellyfish's sting, which helps it\ncapture prey and defend itself, is its most infamous calling card. In the jelly's epidermis, cells called nematocysts\nlie coiled like poisonous harpoons. When they're triggered by contact,\nthey shoot with an explosive force. It exerts over 550 times the pressure\nof Mike Tyson's strongest punch to inject venom into the victim. Some jellyfish stings barely tingle, but others cause severe skin damage. The venom of one box jellyfish\ncan kill a human in under five minutes, making it one of the most potent\npoisons of any animal in the world. Other jellyfish superpowers \nare less lethal. One species of jellyfish glows green\nwhen it's agitated, mostly thanks to a biofluorescent compound\ncalled green fluorescent protein, or GFP. Scientists isolated the gene for GFP and figured out how to insert it\ninto the DNA of other cells. There, it acts like a biochemical beacon, marking genetic modifications, or revealing the path \nof critical molecules. Scientists have used the glow of GFP\nto watch cancer cells proliferate, track the development of Alzheimer's, and illuminate countless other\nbiological processes. Developing the tools and techniques\nfrom GFP has netted three scientists\na Nobel Prize in 2008, and another three in 2014. But it's jellyfish who may be the most\nsuccessful organisms on Earth. Ancient fossils prove that jellyfish\nhave inhabited the seas for at least 500 million years, and maybe go back over 700 million. That's longer than any \nother multiorgan animal. And as other marine animals \nare struggling to survive in warmer and more acidic oceans, the jellyfish are thriving, and perhaps getting even more numerous. It doesn't hurt that some can lay\nas many as 45,000 eggs in a single night. And there's some jellyfish \nwhose survival strategy almost sounds like science fiction. When the immortal jellyfish is sick,\naging, or under stress, its struggling cells can change\ntheir identity. The tiny bell and tentacles deteriorate and turn into an immature polyp that spawns brand new clones\nof the parent. As far as we know, these are the only\nanimals who found a loophole when facing mortality. That's pretty sophisticated for species\nthat are 95% water and predate the dinosaurs."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The explosive sting of some jellyfish exerts ____ times the pressure of Mike Tyson's strongest punch.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1/5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1/2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "550"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Some jellyfish have panorama vision with __________ eyes that allow them to look in 360 degrees.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "8"}, {"label": "C", "text": "24"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Jellyfish are __________ percent water.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25"}, {"label": "B", "text": "55"}, {"label": "C", "text": "75"}, {"label": "D", "text": ">95"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Jellyfish derived fluorescent and bioluminescent compounds are used for all the following except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cancer Research"}, {"label": "B", "text": "AIDS research"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alzheimer's disease research"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Skyscraper construction materials"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Some jellyfish can lay up to __________ eggs per night.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "45,000"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Jellyfish have one of the earliest nervous systems.

But there's a creature so resilient\nthat it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive\nboth the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels\nof radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures\non Earth, even if it does look more like\na chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives\nall the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade,\nalso known as the water bear, get around this restriction\nwith a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning\nlife without water. And however extraordinary,\ntardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals \ncan all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through \nsomething called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs\ninside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water\nbecomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells\nto replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are\nsensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these\nmolecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated,\nthe matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged, \nfunctional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also\ntolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point\nof water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades \nare extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their\norigin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution \nhas given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others\nyet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy,\nthey exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent,\nincluding Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes\nincluding deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades\nin the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little\npatience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out\nwhether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they,\nand other creatures, stabilize their sensitive \nbiological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge\nto help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that \ncan cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure \nto the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about\nthe environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even\nhelp us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much\nless hospitable than our own?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where are tardigrades normally found?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Forests"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Deserts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ponds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Every continent and in diverse biomes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When a tardigrade dries out what does it do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Curls up into a ball like structure known as a ‘tun’"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Extends its legs and goes rigid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nothing, they just stop moving"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Flatten themselves out"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many species of tardigrades have been discovered?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About 100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About 15,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About 1,200"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How is it thought that tardigrades protect their cellular components when they dry out?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They do not have to; their cellular components are just tougher than normal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They produce molecules that form a protective matrix within their cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They do not protect their cellular components at all; instead they repair the damage after they are rehydrated"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The do not protect their cellular components; instead they make new undamaged components once they are rehydrated"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What kind of real world applications do scientists hope to develop by studying tardigrades?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Methods for stabilizing sensitive biomedical materials, like vaccines"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Generate stress tolerant crops"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Develop therapies and counter measures to the harmful effects of prolonged space flight"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Identify where new forms of life might be found"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 33, "lesson": 5, "title": "Are there dead wasps in figs?", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/csfPjIIV", "transcript": {"en": "Figs are one of my favorite foods. They're sweet and floral, and there's something\nabout the texture that I find so delightful—the outside is soft, but the seeds in the middle\ngive you this totally satisfying crunch. But it turns out that many species of figs\ncontain the bodies of dead wasps. I'm Anna and this is Gross Science. Figs aren't exactly your typical fruit. You can think of them as packages that contain\nall of the fig tree’s flowers within them. But if the flowers are trapped inside the\nfig how do they get pollinated? Well, that's where fig wasps come in. In most species, pregnant female fig wasps\ncarrying pollen are attracted to young figs. They enter through a tiny opening at the fig’s\nbottom that’s highly selective—it usually only lets in the exact species of wasps that\npollinate it. But, even the pollinators have a hard time\ngetting in. Most lose their wings and antennae in the\nprocess. The wasp’s goal is to find a home for her\nbabies. And the perfect home is inside the fig’s\nfemale flowers—those are the ones that would produce seeds if they were fertilized. So, the mama wasp drops a fertilized egg inside\nas many of the female flowers as she can—sometimes, up to a few hundred. But she can't get to all of them. Along the way, she winds up fertilizing the\nrest of the flowers with the fig pollen she's carrying, and those flowers begin developing\nseeds. Once the wasp is finished laying eggs, she\nusually dies inside the fig. Each baby wasp begins to grow, encased in\na protective structure that the plant forms called a gall. The male wasps mature first. When they emerge, they find the galls of the\nfemale wasps, many of whom are their sisters, poke inside, and impregnate them before they've\neven hatched! Then, the males die inside the fig, but not\nbefore boring tiny holes through the fig’s skin. When the females do emerge, the fig has just\nstarted producing pollen. The female wasps pick up some of that pollen\nbefore making their way through the holes their brothers drilled, and go off to find\na new fig to start the cycle again. But the story's not over. At this point, our fig’s seeds are finally\nmature and ready to be planted. And that happens when the ripe fig is eaten\nby animals, which poop out the seeds, spreading fig plants far and wide. Of course, humans eat figs, too. So, when you bite into a fig are you actually\neating the bodies of dead wasps? Well, if you’re getting your figs from the\nsupermarket, then most likely not. See, humans and figs have a really long history—we’ve\nprobably been domesticating them for over 11,000 years. So, while there are over 750 species in the\nworld, most of the figs we eat are a species called the “common fig,” which humans\nhave had a huge hand in creating. In fact, some common figs are seedless and\ndon’t require pollination at all. Other varieties of common fig do need to be\npollinated, but have separate male and female trees, and we only eat fruits from the female\nones. I’ll put a link in the description to a\ngreat explanation of how common fig pollination happens, but long story short, female wasps\ncan only manage to lay eggs in the the figs from male trees, not female ones. But they can’t tell the difference between\nthe two types of trees. So, if a wasp does enter a female fruit, she’ll\npollinate it, and either manage to escape or die inside the fig. And then that fig might make it to your table. Frankly, one wasp here and there isn’t enough\nto deter me from eating these things. But if you're still feeling squeamish, just\nthink about it this way: by eating that fig, you're benefitting from a complex and in my\nview, beautiful partnership—or, what’s called a “mutualism”— between two very\ndifferent species. One that’s been delicately crafted by around\n90 million years of evolution. And that certainly whets my appetite—at\nleast for curiosity, if not for dinner. MMMM! But also ew."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Wasps crawl inside figs because...", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The flowers are actually on the inside of a fig"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They can hide their eggs there from predators"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fig juice is similar to honey"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "For how long have humans been cultivating figs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "60 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "200 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "11,000 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "43,000 years"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

{"page": 33, "lesson": 7, "title": "The myth of Icarus and Daedalus - Amy Adkins", "category": "Area Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-myth-of-icarus-and-daedalus-amy-adkins", "transcript": {"en": "In mythological ancient Greece, soaring above Crete on wings made\nfrom wax and feathers, Icarus, the son of Daedalus,\ndefied the laws of both man and nature. Ignoring the warnings of his father,\nhe rose higher and higher. To witnesses on the ground,\nhe looked like a god, and as he peered down from above,\nhe felt like one, too. But, in mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man\nwas absolute and the punishment for mortals\nwho attempted to cross it was severe. Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus. Years before Icarus was born, his father Daedalus was highly regarded\nas a genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor in his homeland of Athens. He invented carpentry\nand all the tools used for it. He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor. He made sculptures so lifelike\nthat Hercules mistook them for actual men. Though skilled and celebrated,\nDaedalus was egotistical and jealous. Worried that his nephew\nwas a more skillful craftsman, Daedalus murdered him. As punishment, Daedalus was banished\nfrom Athens and made his way to Crete. Preceded by his storied reputation, Daedalus was welcomed \nwith open arms by Crete's King Minos. There, acting as the palace \ntechnical advisor, Daedalus continued to push the boundaries. For the king's children, he made mechanically animated toys\nthat seemed alive. He invented the ship's sail and mast,\nwhich gave humans control over the wind. With every creation, Daedalus challenged\nhuman limitations that had so far kept mortals\nseparate from gods, until finally, he broke right through. King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë,\nhad been cursed by the god Poseidon to fall in love\nwith the king's prized bull. Under this spell, she asked Daedalus\nto help her seduce it. With characteristic audacity, he agreed. Daedalus constructed a hollow\nwooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull. With Pasiphaë hiding inside\nDaedalus's creation, she conceived and gave birth\nto the half-human half-bull minotaur. This, of course, enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling\nsuch a horrible perversion of natural law. As punishment, Daedalus was forced\nto construct an inescapable labyrinth beneath the palace for the minotaur. When it was finished, Minos then\nimprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower\non the island where they were to remain \nfor the rest of their lives. But Daedalus was still a genius inventor. While observing the birds\nthat circled his prison, the means for escape became clear. He and Icarus would fly away\nfrom their prison as only birds or gods could do. Using feathers from the flocks\nthat perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs\nof giant wings. As he strapped the wings\nto his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean \nwould dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use. Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax\nand the wings would disintegrate. In either case, they surely would die. Therefore, the key to their escape\nwould be in keeping to the middle. With the instructions clear,\nboth men leapt from the tower. They were the first mortals ever to fly. While Daedalus stayed carefully\nto the midway course, Icarus was overwhelmed\nwith the ecstasy of flight and overcome with the feeling of\ndivine power that came with it.

{"page": 33, "lesson": 8, "title": "Where do superstitions come from? - Stuart Vyse", "category": "Social Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/where-do-superstitions-come-from-stuart-vyse", "transcript": {"en": "Are you afraid of black cats? Would you open an umbrella indoors? And how do you feel about \nthe number thirteen? Whether or not you believe in them, you're probably familiar with a few\nof these superstitions. So how did it happen that people\nall over the world knock on wood, or avoid stepping on sidewalk cracks? Well, although they have no basis\nin science, many of these weirdly specific beliefs\nand practices do have equally weird\nand specific origins. Because they involve supernatural causes, it's no surprise that many superstitions\nare based in religion. For example. the number thirteen was\nassociated with the biblical Last Supper, where Jesus Christ dined \nwith his twelve disciples just before being arrested and crucified. The resulting idea that having thirteen\npeople at a table was bad luck eventually expanded into thirteen\nbeing an unlucky number in general. Now, this fear of the number thirteen,\ncalled triskaidekaphobia, is so common that many buildings around \nthe world skip the thirteenth floor, with the numbers going straight from\ntwelve to fourteen. Of course, many people consider\nthe story of the Last Supper to be true but other superstitions come from \nreligious traditions that few people believe in\nor even remember. Knocking on wood is thought to come from \nthe folklore of the ancient Indo-Europeans or possibly people who predated them who believed that trees were home\nto various spirits. Touching a tree would invoke \nthe protection or blessing of the spirit within. And somehow, this tradition survived long after \nbelief in these spirits had faded away. Many superstitions common today\nin countries from Russia to Ireland are thought to be remnants of the pagan\nreligions that Christianity replaced. But not all superstitions are religious. Some are just based on unfortunate\ncoincidences and associations. For example, many Italians fear\nthe number 17 because the Roman numeral XVII\ncan be rearranged to form the word vixi, meaning my life had ended. Similarly, the word for the number four sounds almost identical \nto the word for death in Cantonese, as well as languages like Japanese and Korean that have borrowed \nChinese numerals. And since the number one also\nsounds like the word for must, the number fourteen sounds\nlike the phrase must die. That's a lot of numbers for elevators\nand international hotels to avoid. And believe it or not, some superstitions actually make sense, or at least they did until we \nforgot their original purpose. For example, theater scenery used to\nconsist of large painted backdrops, raised and lowered by stagehands\nwho would whistle to signal each other. Absentminded whistles from other people\ncould cause an accident. But the taboo against whistling backstage\nstill exists today, long after the stagehands started using\nradio headsets. Along the same lines, lighting three\ncigarettes from the same match really could cause bad luck\nif you were a soldier in a foxhole where keeping a match lit too long\ncould draw attention from an enemy sniper. Most smokers no longer have to worry\nabout snipers, but the superstition lives on. So why do people cling to these bits\nof forgotten religions, coincidences, and outdated advice? Aren't they being totally irrational? Well, yes, but for many people, superstitions are based more\non cultural habit than conscious belief. After all, no one is born knowing to avoid\nwalking under ladders or whistling indoors, but if you grow up being told\nby your family to avoid these things, chances are they'll make \nyou uncomfortable, even after you logically understand\nthat nothing bad will happen. And since doing something like knocking\non wood doesn't require much effort, following the superstition is often\neasier than consciously resisting it. Besides, superstitions \noften do seem to work. Maybe you remember hitting a home run\nwhile wearing your lucky socks. This is just our psychological \nbias at work. You're far less likely to remember \nall the times you struck out while wearing the same socks. But believing that they work\ncould actually make you play better by giving you the illusion of having\ngreater control over events. So in situations where that confidence\ncan make a difference, like sports, those crazy superstitions might not\nbe so crazy after all."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Triskaidekaphobia is the fear of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tree snakes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The number 4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The number 13"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The number 17"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The belief that knocking on wood brings good luck is thought to stem from the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ancient Indo-Europeans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Medieval Christians"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ancient Africans"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ancient Chinese"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following superstitions was once good advice?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Avoid the number 13"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Don’t step on a crack"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Don’t cross a black cat’s path"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Don’t whistle in the theater"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Many common superstitions come from history of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Business"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Religion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Medicine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sport"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is not a reason people believe in superstitions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they grew up hearing about superstitions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because superstitions give them a sense of control"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because superstitions often appear to work"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because superstitions really do work"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

{"page": 33, "lesson": 10, "title": "Why cartoon characters wear gloves", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/B8Xg7ber", "transcript": {"en": "This is the VHS for An Extremely Goofy Movie. It’s the follow up to the cult classic A Goofy Movie and it’s one of my favorite animated films. Now, there’s a moment in this movie where Bobby Zimmeruski, Max’s stoner friend — You know, the one that chugs Cheese Wiz? He says, “Do you ever wonder  why we’re always like... wearing gloves?” That’s a damn good question, Bobby. Let’s figure this out. Does the question, \"Why do Animated characters wear gloves?\", come up a lot for you? John: The question rarely comes up, but when it does, there are a number of answers to it. That’s John Canemaker, he’s an animation historian and professor at NYU. The most basic theory is that gloves saved time. John: Animation of any kind— even with computers— is a very work-intensive or labor intensive process. \"Pardon me. I've always wondered how they were made.\" At the dawn of animation, everything was hand-drawn over and over and over again. And certain techniques to make the process more efficient shaped the style of the cartoons. John: Felix the Cat, for example, was a very boxy-looking character. As Felix was becoming more popular, the animator Bill Nolan decided to remove his snout and make him more circular overall. John: And that design—what they call the rubber hose and circle design, very spaghetti-like arms of the characters— continued to the design of Mickey Mouse as well. This rubber hose and circle aesthetic allowed animators to quickly draw arms, legs, and heads without spending too much time developing realistic details of the character’s body—like elbows and knees. A round edge was much faster to draw than an angle, and that certainly applied to hands, with all those fingers and knuckles. But hands posed another a problem for animators in the age of fuzzy black and white film. John: Characters were in black and white films difficult to see against their black bodies. Take a look at Mickey Mouse. In 1927’s Plane Crazy he had black hands and feet, just like Felix. He gained shoes by 1928’s Steamboat Willie and in 1929 he’s wearing gloves in The Opry House. The rubber hose style of animation is in full effect here. Every character is exaggerated, round, and simple. And like many of the glove-wearing cartoon characters of his time, Mickey Mouse is a non-human doing very human things. In his 1968 biography, \"The Disney Version\", Walt Disney addresses this very issue. He says, \"We didn't want him to have mouse hands, because he was supposed to be more human. So we gave him gloves.” So in addition to saving time and providing color contrast, gloves bring non-human things to life, making their grand gestures stand out. These 1935 tea kettles from Van Beuren Studio have them. This movie camera does too. When Pinocchio is a puppet, he wears gloves. But when he becomes a boy, they disappear. They’re no longer needed. But there’s another, less practical influence behind cartoon characters’ white gloves. The Opry House is a film about Mickey putting on a big vaudeville show. That film and many of the animations that predated it were inextricably linked to vaudeville performance and the blackface minstrel shows of the time. In fact, early animators often performed on vaudeville stages. Nicholas Sammond writes in Birth of An Industry that early animated characters like Felix the Cat, Bimbo, Bosko, and Mickey Mouse “weren’t just like Minstrels, they were Minstrels.” Both the cartoons and the stage characters were portrayed as mischievous and rebellious yet good natured. They wore loose clothes, had painted faces, and … they wore white gloves. In the 1930s vaudeville and blackface minstrelsy declined. White gloves were no longer associated with vaudeville to a new generation of viewers. Instead, they were just part of the cartoon style people came to expect. John: There’s also The Band Concert, do you know that film? It’s from 1935. John: One of the characters is Clarabelle Cow and she plays the flute and her glove gets stuck in the flute [chiuckles] so, really strange without the glove on it. Sixty years later Goofy takes off his gloves before getting in a pool and it’s quite frankly, really disturbing. Now what’s really bothering me is why Daffy Duck and many other animated birds don’t wear gloves. We might never know. Daffy: Look, let’s not split hairs. Why do you even wear gloves? Bugs Bunny: Because, I’ve always worn them. It’s who I am. Why do you wear that thing around your neck? Touché Bugs Bunny. Touché."}, "multiple-choice": []}

Parker", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/does-the-wonderful-wizard-of-oz-have-a-hidden-message-david-b-parker", "transcript": {"en": "In the summer of 1963, a high school teacher changed the way\nthe world looked at \"The Wizard of Oz.\" His name was Henry Littlefield, and he was teaching \nan American history class. He'd made it to the late 19th century,\na time called The Gilded Age, but he was struggling to keep\nhis class interested in the complex social and economic\nissues of the time. Then one night, while he was reading \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\"\nto his daughters, he had an idea. In the 1890s, farmers wanted to add silver\nto the gold standard to put more money in circulation and make it easier for farmers to borrow. In the book, Dorothy walked to\nthe Emerald City on the Yellow Brick Road in her silver shoes. The movie's ruby red slippers \nstarted out as silver. Silver and gold on the road to prosperity. L. Frank Baum had published\nthe book in 1900 at the height of The Gilded Age, and the analogy didn't seem\nout of the question. No one else had seen these connections, but that didn't deter Littlefield. He taught his class about The Gilded Age\nusing the book, and soon he and his students were\nfinding more connections. For instance, in the late 1890s, the U.S. had recently recovered\nfrom the Civil War and integrated vast new territories, bringing an era of prosperity for some. But while industry and finance\nin the North and East prospered, farmers across the South\nand Midwest struggled. This led to the Populist movement, uniting farmers and workers against\nurban elites. By 1896, the movement had grown\ninto the People's Party, and its support of Democrat\nWilliams Jennings Bryan put him in reach of the presidency. Meanwhile in Oz, claimed Littlefield, Dorothy is a typical American girl whose hard life in Kansas is literally\nturned upside down by powerful forces outside her control. The munchkins are the common people\noppressed by the Witch of the East, banks and monopolies. The Scarecrow is the farmer, considered naive but actually\nquite resourceful, the Tin Woodman is the industrial worker\ndehumanized by factory labor, and the Cowardly Lion \nis William Jennings Bryan who could be an influential figure\nif only he were brave enough to adopt the Populist's radical program. Together, they travel along\na golden yellow road towards a grand city whose ruler's power\nturns out to be built on illusions. Littlefield published some of these\nobservations in an essay. His claim that this fantasy was actually\na subversive critique of American capitalism appealed\nto many people in 1960s. Other scholars took up the theme, and the proposed analogies\nand connections multiplied. They suggested that Dorothy's dog Toto represented the teetotalers\nof the prohibition party. Oz was clearly the abbreviation\nfor ounces, an important unit in the silver debate. The list goes on. By the 1980s, this understanding\nof the book was accepted so widely that several American history textbooks mentioned it in discussions of\nlate 19th century politics. But is the theory right? L. Frank Baum's introduction claims the \nbook is just an innocent children's story. Could he have been deliberately\nthrowing people off the trail? And is it fair to second guess\nhim so many decades later? There's no definitive answer, which is part of why authorial intent is a complex, tangled, fun question\nto unravel. And some recent scholars have interpreted\n\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" in the opposite way as Littlefield. They claim it's a celebration of the \nnew urban consumer culture. Historian William Leach argued that\nthe dazzling Emerald City of Oz was meant to acclimate people\nto the shiny, new America. In the end, all we know\nfor sure is that Baum, inspired by European folk legends, had set out to create one\nfor American children. And whether or not he intended\nany hidden meanings, its continuing relevance suggests\nhe succeeded in creating a fairytale\nAmerica can call its own."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who was the high school History teacher who first suggested that \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" reflected certain aspects of American culture and politics?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Buddy Ebsen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Henry Littlefield"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Judy Garland"}, {"label": "D", "text": "William McKinley"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to the most popular interpretation of the book, the Tin Woodman represented:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The British band Pink Floyd"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gilded Age industrial workers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Farmers from the midwest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Victorian-era preachers"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Wicked Witch of the East, according to this interpretation, stood for:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "American presidents who ignored the wishes of the people"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Banks and monopolies that oppressed the common people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spanish imperialists who colonized the Philippines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Teetotalers who tried to impose Prohibition on society"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the 1939 MGM movie, Dorothy’s shoes were ruby red; in the book, they were:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Black"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Emerald green"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Royal blue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Silver"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The author of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Harriet Beecher Stowe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "L.

Campbell", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/are-ghost-ships-real-peter-b-campbell", "transcript": {"en": "One foggy morning in 1884, the British steamer \"Rumney\" crashed\ninto the French ship \"Frigorifique.\" Seeing their ship filling with water, the French crew climbed \naboard the \"Rumney.\" But as they sailed towards \nthe nearest port, a silent form suddenly emerged\nfrom the fog: the abandoned \"Frigorifique.\" It was too late to turn, and the impact was enough \nto sink the \"Rumney.\" As the sailors scrambled \ninto the lifeboats, the empty \"Frigorifique\"\nsailed back into the fog, having seemingly taken its revenge. In reality, the French sailors had left\nthe engines running, and the \"Frigorifique\" sailed in a circle\nbefore striking the \"Rumney\" and finally sinking. But its story became one of the many tales\nof ghost ships, unmanned vessels that apparently\nsail themselves. And although they've influenced\nworks like \"Dracula\" and \"Pirates of the Caribbean,\" crewless ships aren't the product\nof ghostly spirits, just physics at work. One of the most famous ghost ships\nwas the \"Mary Celeste\" found sailing the Atlantic in 1872\nwith no one aboard, water in its hold, and lifeboats missing. The discovery of its intact cargo\nand a captain's log that ended abruptly led to wild rumors and speculation. But the real culprits \nwere two scientific phenomena: buoyancy and fluid dynamics. Here's how buoyancy works. An object placed in a liquid displaces\na certain volume of fluid. The liquid in turn exerts\nan upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid\nthat's been displaced. This phenomenon is called\nArchimedes's Principle. Objects that are less dense than water, such as balsa wood, icebergs, and inflatable rafts always float. That's because the upward buoyant force is always stronger than \nthe downward force of gravity. But for objects or ships to float when \nthey're made of materials, like steel, that are denser than water, they must displace a volume of water\nlarger than their weight. Normally, the water filling a ship's hull\nwould increase its weight and cause it to sink - just what the \"Mary Celeste's\" crew feared\nwhen they abandoned ship. But the sailors didn't account \nfor fluid dynamics. The water stopped flowing at the point\nof equilibrium, when it reached \nthe same level as the hull. As it turned out, the weight of the water\nwasn't enough to sink the ship and the \"Mary Celeste\"\nwas found a few days later while the unfortunate crew \nnever made it to shore. Far stranger is the tale \nof \"A. Ernest Mills,\" a schooner transporting salt, whose crew watched it sink to \nthe sea floor following a collision. Yet four days later,\nit was spotted floating on the surface. The key to the mystery lay in the ship's\nheavy cargo of salt. The added weight of the water in the hull\nmade the vessel sink, but as the salt dissolved in the water, the weight decreased enough that the force of gravity \nbecame less than the buoyant force and the ship floated back to the surface. But how do we explain the most\nenduring aspect of ghost ship legends: multiple sightings of the same ships \nhundreds of miles and several years apart? The answer lies in ocean currents, which are like invisible rivers flowing\nthrough the ocean. Factors, like temperature, salinity, wind, gravity, and the Coriolis effect from\nthe Earth's rotation create a complex system of water movement. That applies both at the ocean's surface\nand deep below. Sailors have always known about currents, but their patterns weren't well known\nuntil recently. In fact, tracking abandoned ships was how\nscientists determined the shape and speed of the Atlantic Gyre, the Gulf Stream, and related currents in the first place. Beginning in 1883, \nthe U.S. Hydrographic Office began collecting monthly data\nthat included navigation hazards, like derelict ships, whose locations\nwere reported by passing vessels. So abandoned ships may not be moved\nby ghost crews or supernatural curses, but they are a real \nand fascinating phenomenon born through the ocean and kept afloat by powerful, invisible,\nscientifically studied forces."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The sunken \"A.

Because it's great for working out how a particle, or in this case, a pool ball, will rebound against the sides, and where it will go. So I thought \"enough of these thought experiments, lets build one!\" The shape is an ellipse, and ellipses are an interesting type of shape, because they can come in a infinite number of varieties. The geometrical property of ellipses, which is why I made this table, is the fact that if you place a ball on a focus point... ...where ever you hit it, in which ever direction I hit it, over there, over there, over there, over there, over here, \nit will always rebound into that pocket. That is because from any point on the side, it makes the same angle to each focus point. And as you know, when you rebound something against a surface... ... the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Whenever it is positioned on this focus point, wherever I hit it, it will go in. If it's here, wherever I rebound it, it's never going to go in. It's only when it's exactly on this dot. So that's the theory, and that makes this really good fun.  I will demonstrate it. But obviously I'm a mathematician and I love things to be perfect, but this is, we're in the real world... ...so now kind of annoying physics gets in the way. Things like friction, things like the difficulty of manufacture. You also have to hit it with just the right force. For example, if I hit it really hard... ... it rebounds to this side of the pocket. If I hit it, but softly... ... it goes to the other side of the pocket. So obviously there is the Goldilocks hit, the one that's neither too hard nor too soft, that should get it in. And let's see if I can do that. If I do get it in, it's really difficult. So you have to be very skilful. Oh, beautiful! It's so satisfying the way it goes round and round and round. It's reminding me I got it in. Okay. So I chose to hit it over here. We can nominate any other part of the board. Again, it's going to be difficult because I don't have much time to practice on this. I'm not a very skilled pool player. But maybe something like... Oh! [Brady]: Take the camera.  I'll get my first ever shot. It was quite.. Perfect! At first I was a bit disappointed it was so difficult... ... and then I realized it's actually much better that it's difficult, because it's more more fun.

So when Mary and Percy Shelley arrived\nat the House of Lord Byron on Lake Geneva, their vacation was mostly spent indoors. For amusement, Byron proposed a challenge\nto his literary companions: who could write the most chilling\nghost story? This sparked an idea in 18-year-old Mary. Over the next few months, she would craft\nthe story of “Frankenstein.” Popular depictions may evoke a green\nand groaning figure, but that's not Mary Shelley's monster. In fact, in the book, Frankenstein\nrefers to the nameless monster's maker, Dr. Victor Frankenstein. So tense is the struggle between\ncreator and creature that the two have merged \nin our collective imagination. Before you read \nor reread the original text, there are several other things that \nare helpful to know about Frankenstein and how it came to assume \nits multiple meanings. The book traces Dr. Frankenstein's\nfutile quest to impart and sustain life. He constructs his monster\npart by part from dead matter and electrifies it into conscious being. Upon completing the experiment, however,\nhe's horrified at the result and flees. But time and space aren't enough\nto banish the abandoned monster, and the plot turns on a chilling chase\nbetween the two. Shelley subtitled her \nfireside ghost story, \"The Modern Prometheus.\" That's in reference to the Greek myth\nof the Titan Prometheus who stole fire from the gods\nand gave it to humanity. This gave humanity knowledge and power, but for tampering with the status quo, Prometheus was chained to a rock\nand eaten by vultures for eternity. Prometheus enjoyed a resurgence\nin the literature of the Romantic Period during the 18th century. Mary was a prominent Romantic, and shared the movement's appreciation for\nnature, emotion, and the purity of art. Two years after Mary\nreleased “Frankenstein,” Percy reimagined the plight\nof Prometheus in his lyrical drama, \"Prometheus Unbound.\" The Romantics used \nthese mythical references to signal the purity of the ancient world\nin contrast to modernity. They typically regarded science\nwith suspicion, and \"Frankenstein\" is one of the first\ncautionary tales about artificial intelligence. For Shelley, the terror\nwas not supernatural, but born in a lab. In addition, gothic devices \ninfuse the text. The gothic genre is characterized\nby unease, eerie settings, the grotesque, and the fear of oblivion— all elements that can \nbe seen in \"Frankenstein.\" But this horror had roots \nin personal trauma, as well. The text is filled with references\nto Shelley's own circumstances. Born in 1797, Mary was the child\nof William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were radical intellectual figures, and her mother's book,\n\"A Vindication of the Rights of Women,\" is a key feminist text. Tragically, she died as a result\nof complications from Mary’s birth. Mary was haunted by her mother's death, and later experienced her own\nproblems with childbirth. She became pregnant following\nher elopement with Percy at 16, but that baby died shortly after birth. Out of four more pregnancies,\nonly one of their children survived. Some critics have linked this tragedy\nto the themes explored in \"Frankenstein.\" Shelley depicts birth as both creative\nand destructive, and the monster becomes a disfigured\nmirror of the natural cycle of life. The monster, therefore, embodies\nDr. Frankenstein's corruption of nature in the quest for glory. This constitutes his fatal flaw, \nor hamartia. His god complex is most clear in the line, \"Life and death appear to me ideal bounds\nwhich I should first break through and pour a torrent of light\nonto our dark world.\" Although he accomplishes\nsomething awe-inspiring, he has played with fire at his own\nethical expense. And that decision echoes \nthroughout the novel, which is full of references to fire\nand imagery that contrasts light and dark. These moments suggest not only the spark\nof Prometheus's fire, but the power of radical ideas to expose\ndarker areas of life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The genre of Frankenstein can be defined as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gothic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Science Fiction"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Horror"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Romantic"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "An aspect of the Shelleys' writing which places them in the category of Romantic writers is the presence of ___ in their writing.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wild adventure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Passionate love stories"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mythological references"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Overt political statements"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Dr. Frankenstein flees from his monster because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The monster threatens to kill him"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He is disgusted at what he’s done"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He is disappointed in his experiment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The monster sets the lab on fire"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The subtitle “The Modern Prometheus” refers to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dr. Frankenstein"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The monster"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mary Shelley"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lord Byron"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Mary Shelley used Prometheus to represent:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The dangers of playing with the natural order"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The power of science"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The irrelevance of the ancient world"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The appeal of the unknown"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A, B, and D only"}, {"label": "F", "text": "All of the above are answers"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

You and your team have crash-landed\non an ancient planet. The only way off is to appease\nits three alien overlords, Tee, Eff, and Arr, by giving them the correct artifacts. Unfortunately, you don't\nknow who is who. From an inscription, you learn that you\nmay ask three yes or no questions, each addressed to any one lord. Tee's answers are always true, Eff's are always false, and Arr's answer is random each time. But there's a problem. You've deciphered the language enough\nto ask any question, but you don't know which of the two\nwords 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes and which means no. How can you still figure out \nwhich alien is which? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1 At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,\nbut downright impossible. What good is asking a question if you can neither understand the answer\nnor know if it's true? But it can be done. The key is to carefully formulate\nour questions so that any answer \nyields useful information. First of all, we can get around\nto not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean by including the words themselves\nin the questions, and secondly, if we load each question\nwith a hypothetical condition, whether an alien is lying or not\nwon't actually matter. To see how that could work, imagine our question\nis whether two plus two is four. Instead of posing it directly, we say, \"If I asked you whether\ntwo plus two is four, would you answer 'ozo'?\" If 'ozo' means yes \nand the overlord is Tee, it truthfully replies, \"ozo.\" But what if we ask Eff? Well, it would answer \"ulu,\"\nor no to the embedded question, so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead. And if 'ozo' actually means no, then the answer to \nour embedded question is 'ulu,' and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,' each for their own reasons. If you're confused about why this works, the reason involves logical structure. A double positive and a double negative\nboth result in a positive. Now, we can be sure that asking\neither Tee or Eff a question put this way will yield 'ozo'\nif the hypothetical question is true and 'ulu' if it's false regardless of what \neach word actually means. Unfortunately, \nthis doesn't help us with Arr. But don't worry, we can use our first\nquestion to identify one alien lord that definitely isn't Arr. Then we can use the second to find out\nwhether its Tee or Eff. And once we know that, we can ask it to identify \none of the others. So let's begin. Ask the alien in the middle, \"If I asked you whether the overlord on\nmy left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?\" If the reply is 'ozo,' \nthere are two possibilities. You could already be talking to Arr,\nin which case the answer is meaningless. But otherwise, you're talking to either\nTee or Eff, and as we know, getting 'ozo' from either one means \nyour hypothetical question was correct, and the left overlord is indeed Arr. Either way, you can be sure the alien\non the right is not Arr. Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,' then you know the alien \non the left can't be Arr. Now go to the overlord you've determined\nisn't Arr and ask, \"If I asked 'are you Eff?' \nwould you answer 'ozo'?\" Since you don't have to worry about\nthe random possibility, either answer will \nestablish its identity. Now that you know whether its\nanswers are true or false, ask the same alien whether the center\noverlord is Arr. The process of elimination will identify\nthe remaining one. The satisfied overlords help you\nrepair your ship and you prepare for takeoff. Allowed one final question, you ask\nTee if it's a long way to Earth, and he answers \"ozo.\" Too bad you still don't know \nwhat that means."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are you trying to do to solve the puzzle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Trick the aliens into repairing your ship"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Escape from the aliens by finding the correct route to your ship"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Learn the correct identity of each of the three aliens"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the limitations on your questions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Each alien will only answer questions about the others, not about themselves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Your questions must be in a yes or no form"}, {"label": "C", "text": "You may only ask three questions total"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why can’t you just directly ask each alien about their identities?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only one of them tells the truth and you don’t know which one it is"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are hostile and won’t answer your questions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can’t understand you since you don’t speak their language"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What do the words ‘ozo’ and ‘ulu’ mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes and no, in that order"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No and yes, in that order"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yes and no, but you don’t know which is which"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which combination of hypothetical conditions does NOT yield a positive?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Two positives"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A positive and a negative"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Two negative"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

He pieced the parts together to create the complex inner working\nof a striking clock that would, hopefully, \nchime every hour. All he had to help him was \na pocket watch for inspiration and his own calculations. And yet, his careful engineering worked. Striking clocks had already been\naround for hundreds of years, but Banneker's may have been\nthe first created in America, and it drew fascinated visitors from\nacross the country. In a show of his brilliance, the clock continued to chime\nfor the rest of Banneker's life. Born in 1731 to freed slaves\non a farm in Baltimore, Maryland, from his earliest days, the young Banneker was obsessed\nwith math and science. And his appetite for knowledge only grew\nas he taught himself astronomy, mathematics, engineering, and the study of the natural world. As an adult, he used astronomy\nto accurately predict lunar and solar events, like the solar eclipse of 1789, and even applied his mathematical skills\nto land use planning. These talents caught the eye of a local\nBaltimore businessman, Andrew Ellicott, who was also the Surveyor General\nof the United States. Recognizing Banneker's skills in 1791, Ellicott appointed him as an assistant\nto work on a prestigious new project, planning the layout \nof the nation's capitol. Meanwhile, Banneker turned \nhis brilliant mind to farming. He used his scientific expertise\nto pioneer new agricultural methods on his family's tobacco farm. His fascination with the natural world also led to a study on the plague\nlife cycle of locusts. Then in 1792, Banneker \nbegan publishing almanacs. These provided detailed annual information\non moon and sun cycles, weather forecasts, and planting and tidal time tables. Banneker sent a handwritten copy\nof his first almanac to Virginia's Secretary of State\nThomas Jefferson. This was a decade before Jefferson\nbecame president. Banneker included a letter imploring\nJefferson to \"embrace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd \nand false ideas and opinions\" that caused prejudice \nagainst black people. Jefferson read the almanac and wrote\nback in praise of Banneker's work. Banneker's correspondence with \nthe future president is now considered to be one of the first\ndocumented examples of a civil rights \nprotest letter in America. For the rest of his life,\nhe fought for this cause, sharing his opposition to slavery\nthrough his writing. In 1806 at the age of 75, Banneker died after a lifetime\nof study and activism. On the day of his funeral,\nhis house mysteriously burned down, and the majority of his life's work, including his striking clock, \nwas destroyed.

{"page": 33, "lesson": 18, "title": "7 things we don't know about the ocean", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/0l9cs5ke", "transcript": {"en": "Humans have done a pretty good job of exploring\nthe Earth thus far, climbing mountains and crossing continents and planting our flags\nall over the place in the name of science. But one part of the world that has remained pretty\nmysterious to us also happens to cover more than 70% of its surface: the ocean. Yes , we’ve sailed across it plenty of times.\nAnd drilled for oil in it. And managed to create reality shows about fishing in it. But, from glowing oceans to massive deep-sea\ncreatures, and underwater ecosystems with thousands of undiscovered, basically-alien\nspecies -- we still have a lot to learn about it. Probably more than any place on Earth, the\nocean is full of fascinating stuff that we just don’t know. Not yet. [Music Playing] Number One: What’s the ocean floor like? Fact is, we still don’t know exactly what\nthe ocean floor looks like in most places. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\nsays that 95% of the ocean's bottom remains unseen by humans. As a result, we have a way better picture of the surfaces of other planets than we do of most of the seafloor. In 2014, a team of scientists created a map\nof the seafloor using data from satellites equipped with special sensors called radar\naltimeters. These instruments could precisely measure the distance from the satellite to the surface of the ocean below. Essentially, any large mountains or canyons\non the ocean floor have a slight gravitational effect on the ocean surface, creating bumps and dips, respectively. These variations are of course too subtle to be detected by human eyes, but they can be measured by these ultra-precise satellite altimeters\n-- and, after adjusting for the effect of waves and tides, tell scientists what’s\non the seafloor. This map spans the entire ocean floor, which is awesome, and we’re all glad that it exists, but it only has a resolution of about 5 kilometers, which is pretty low. By comparison, most of the surface of Mars, Venus, and the Moon have been mapped to resolutions of 100 meters or less. So, if we want to know what’s going on down there and really explore the ocean, detecting life, specific mineral formations, or wrecks, we’re gonna need a better map. Number Two: What’s under the seafloor? OK, probably thinking that you know what’s\ndown there: rock. Yes. But not just rock. In 2015, scientists reported that they had\ndrilled down about 2 and a half kilometers below the seafloor off the coast of Japan,\nand discovered living microbes. There were only about 10 to 10,000 microorganisms\nin a cubic centimeter of sediment that they studied, compared to like billions that you’d\nfind in the same amount of dirt from your garden. But still: There's life down there, even\nin the intense heat and pressure many kilometers below where the ocean stops. And the genomes of these under-sea microbes\nshowed that they were actually more similar to the kind you’d find in forest soil, rather\nthan the ones in seafloor sediments. So it’s possible that these microbes are\ndescendants of terrestrial ones from 20 million years ago, that just adapted when their habitat\nbegan to get buried way beneath the ocean. So, who knows what other kinds of life could\nexist in deep marine sediments, or what they could tell us about what life on Earth used to be like? Number Three: Brine pools. We’ve all seen lakes and rivers on land,\nbut what about lakes that are … underwater? Sounds a little bit unreal, like maybe it’s from a Sponge Bob episode but these features actually exist -- pockets of seawater that have a different\ncomposition than the surrounding ocean: because they’re super salty. They’re known as brine pools, and they seem\nto have formed when layers of salt from evaporated oceans millions of years ago got buried under\nlayers of sediment. Seawater can reach these deposits and mix\nwith the salt, forming a dense brine that flows out of the seafloor, sometimes filled\nwith oils or methane gas. Some brine pools, like those found deep in\nthe Gulf of Mexico, are four times as salty as the ocean water around it. And the brine is so dense that submersibles\ncan even “float” on top of it, like a boat on a lake. All of this salt makes brine pools lethal\nto larger animals. But colonies of halophilic -- or salt-loving\n-- microorganisms can flourish there, usually in much higher concentrations than the nearby\nnormal seawater. Some pools are even lined with mussels that\nhave symbiotic bacteria in their gills, which use the methane in the brine to make energy\nfor the mussels. But there’s a ton that we don’t know about\nthese weird underwater salt lakes -- like how brine pools can be so different from each\nother -- and why some have mussels and others don’t -- and even how many there are! Number Four: Milky seas. Also known as mareel, this is a\nphenomenon in which thousands of square kilometers of the ocean’s surface glow a brilliant\nwhitish-blue. It lasts for such a short time, and there\nhave been so few recorded sightings, that these glowing seas were thought to be a myth\nmade up by crazy sailors… … until 2005 -- when a group of researchers\nwas studying satellite pictures of a swath of the Indian Ocean from 1995. These pictures showed an area of about 15,000 kilometers-square, around the size of Connecticut, glowing for 3 nights. It was the first scientific evidence of the\nphenomenon, but the glowing waters are still not very well understood. Some have suggested that the glow is caused by a mass of tiny dinoflagellates called Noctiluca scintillans known as “sea sparkles” for the way they glow when disturbed. These protists are what cause the picturesque\nglittering waves along coastlines in some parts of the world. But the 2005 study found that it was “unlikely,\nif not impossible” that the short-lived glowing of dinoflagellates was what scientists had been seeing from space. The prevailing theory these days is that milky\nseas are caused by massive colonies of bioluminescent bacteria that are growing on top of an algal\nbloom. But we’re still not sure how or why these\nephemeral masses of bacteria gather, glow, and disappear. Number Five: The 52 hertz whale. You’d think we would know a lot about whales. I mean, they’re big, and we have their skeletons,\nand we can observe their migratory patterns. But one thing we still have a lot more to learn about is their songs -- from why some whales make them, to how an animal without vocal\ncords … or lips … manages to make song-like sounds. And then there’s this question -- what whale\nis producing the 52 hertz song, and why? This whale song was first noted by a technician\non December 7th, 1992 in the Northeast Pacific Ocean. It sounded like a blue whale, but blue whale\ncries usually are somewhere between 15 and 20 hertz in pitch. So, blue whales in the Pacific typically sound\nlike this: [Blue Whale Cry Playing] But this whale song, played at the same speed,\nsounded like this: [52 Hertz Song Playing] This high-pitch noise seemed to be unique\nto one animal -- a whale that became known as 52 Blue. This raises a lot of questions, and we have\nto know more about whales to be able to answer some of them, like, why does this one whale sound different? And can others even hear it? And if they can hear it, do they understand? Some people latched onto to the idea that\n52 Blue is a lonely whale crying out to others that might not hear it or wouldn’t call\nback. But several scientists have rejected this\nlonely narrative, and think that other whales may be able to understand its call, even if\nthey can’t make that call themselves. Also, 52 blue seems to migrate independently\nfrom any other whales. But its migratory patterns do look kind\nof like those of blue whales -- scientists have been tracking it up and down the North\nPacific from Alaska to Mexico for years now. So some researchers think it might have some\nmalformation that has changed how it sings, or maybe it’s even a hybrid between a blue\nwhale and another species. Whether or not it’s a lonely whale, 52 Blue\nis an oddity that people seem to love. Number Six: Upsweep. Now, ocean sounds are practically their own\nfield of study, NOAA has been monitoring acoustics in the ocean for decades now. Instead of microphones, which are used to\ncollect sound in air, NOAA uses hydrophones to record underwater sounds. Mostly, these hydrophones are used to listen\nto the ambient sound of the ocean, to see how humans might interfere with it, and to listen for things like earthquakes and whale calls. And sometimes, they record things that are\nhard to explain, at least for a while. In 1997, for example, there was what was known\nas The Bloop, an extremely loud, low-frequency sound heard by hydrophones some 5,000 kilometers\napart. Oceanographers recently determined that it\nwas the result of an icequake -- the cracking and collapse of glaciers into the ocean, in\nthis case on the coast of Antarctica. But there’s another mystery sound from the\nocean, known as Upsweep. Recorded in August 1991, it sounds like a\nrepeating “boop” that picks up at the end -- sweeping up -- kind of like the “red\nalert” sound effect you hear on spaceships in sci-fi movies. But instead of trying to describe it, I could just play it for you. [Boop Playing] Since 1991, this sound has been heard regularly\nin the Pacific Ocean, and it seems to be seasonal, usually becoming more common in spring and\nfall. Researchers have tracked the sound to a part\nof the Pacific that has lots of volcanic and seismic activity, which seem to be important\nclues. But according to NOAA, “the origin of the\nsound is unresolved.” Number Seven: Why are deep-sea creatures so\nhuge? From the Kraken to sea dragons, all of our\nfavorite mythical sea monsters are gigantic. And the fact is, in real life, many deep-sea\ncreatures are unusually huge. This phenomenon is called deep-sea gigantism. But what drives it is … you guessed it!\n… unknown! In the deep sea, and especially near the polar\noceans, some animals seem to get really huge -- like colossal squids, giant isopods, and\nJapanese spider crabs. Scientists aren’t sure why, but they do have some guesses. There’s Bergmann’s Rule, for example,\nwhich suggests that temperature may influence gigantism. This might be because larger animals have\nless surface area relative to volume, so they radiate less heat based on their mass and\nstay warmer in colder climates. And then there’s Klieber’s Law,\nwhich states that more massive animals generally have lower metabolic rates -- and therefore\nneed less high-quality food --- to survive. Still other theories suggest that gigantism\nmay help organisms resist increased pressure of the deep sea. But we don’t really have conclusive biological\nreasons why these giant creatures exist. So, the ocean is just full o’ mysteries,\nmaybe because it’s so huge and dark and deep. But just so you know that we’re not hyping\nyou -- we’re not saying that these 7 topics are things that Science Can’t Explain. Instead, you should just think of them as reminders of how much we still have to learn about the ocean. As our technology improves, and our access\nto the ocean takes us to new depths, we’ll be able to see and hear and sample more stuff than we ever have before. So in time, these puzzles will be solved,\nand new creatures will be discovered, and our understanding of our planet, and the life\non it, will be that much … deeper.

Everything might seem quiet...but beneath\nyour feet is a flurry of conversation. All the plants around you are actually talking\nto each other. The trees and the shrubs and the flowers are\npassing information back and forth, with serious life and death consequences. So, how are they communicating? They’re using a giant network of fungi—one\nso pervasive and powerful that some scientists have started comparing it to the Internet. They’re calling it the “Wood Wide Web.” I’m Anna, and this is Gross Science. The so-called Wood Wide Web is made up of\nwhat are called “mycorrhizal fungi.” There are many different types of mycorrhizal\nfungi, but generally these little guys will grow on the roots of plants and provide them\nwith water and nutrients—like nitrogen and phosphorus—in exchange for sugars from the\nplant. While they’re incredibly thin, the threads\nof the fungi can be up to 1000 times the length of a tree root. This allows the fungi to connect together\nmany different plants. Once connections are made, the fungi can act\nalmost like the neurons in our brain, transporting signals from plant to plant. And these networks are everywhere. It’s estimated that around 90% of land plants\nare connected to some kind of mycorrhizal network. So, how can plants use these networks? Well, to begin with, they can help each other\nout in times of stress. For example, during the fall months, when\npaper birch trees lose their leaves and can’t produce sugar, Douglas-fir trees may shuttle\nthem nutrients through the fungal network. And in the summer, when paper birch trees\nhave lots of leaves, they send sugars to young Douglas-fir saplings growing in their shadows. Plants can also warn each other of danger. Douglas-fir trees connected by a fungal network\ncan alert their ponderosa pine neighbors if they’re attacked by budworms. In response, the neighboring ponderosa pine\ntrees will produce insect-repelling chemicals—even though they haven’t been directly exposed\nto the insects themselves. Mycorrhizal fungi can also enable parental\ncare of among plants. Some adult trees will help out their younger\nrelatives by sending those seedlings more nutrients through the fungal network than\nthey send to strangers. The adults may even make more room for them\nin the soil by reducing the number of their own roots. But not everyone is so generous. Much like our internet, things can sometimes\nget a little nasty on the Wood Wide Web. Take Black Walnut trees, for example. They can spread poison through the network,\nhindering the growth of their neighbors. And the fungi making up the network can be\njust as tricky. Mycorrhizal fungi tend to pick favorites. They may share resources with one species\nof tree, but bleed another species dry without giving anything back in return. The fungi may also judge a plant's health. If they think it’s too weak or sick, they\nmay not allow it to receive nutrients or danger signals from the network. Now, we’re only beginning to understand\nhow complex these relationships get. But imagine the possibilities for agriculture\nand forestry. If we find out certain species share well\nacross the network, maybe we can plant them near each other to yield better harvests,\nor grow healthier forests. So next time you’re walking through the\nwoods or the park don’t forget to thank the fungal web beneath your feet.

I'm interested in how many\nare three to 12 years old. (Laughter) None, huh? (Laughter) All right. I'm going to talk about dinosaurs. Do you remember dinosaurs\nwhen you were that age? (Applause) Dinosaurs are kind of funny, you know. (Laughter) We're going to kind of go\nin a different direction right now. I hope you all realize that. So I'll just give you my message up front: Try not to go extinct. (Laughter) That's it. (Laughter) People ask me a lot -- in fact, one of the most asked\nquestions I get is, why do children\nlike dinosaurs so much? What's the fascination? And I usually just say, \"Well, dinosaurs were big, different and gone.\" They're all gone. Well that's not true, but we'll get to the goose in a minute. So that's sort of the theme: big, different and gone. The title of my talk: Shape-shifting Dinosaurs: The cause of a premature extinction. Now I assume that we remember dinosaurs. And there's lots of different shapes. Lots of different kinds. A long time ago, back in the early 1900s,\nmuseums were out looking for dinosaurs. They went out and gathered them up. And this is an interesting story. Every museum wanted a little bigger\nor better one than anybody else had. So if the museum in Toronto went out\nand collected a Tyrannosaur, a big one, then the museum in Ottawa\nwanted a bigger one, and a better one. And that happened for all museums. So everyone was out looking\nfor all these bigger and better dinosaurs. And this was in the early 1900s. By about 1970, some scientists were sitting around\nand they thought, \"What in the world -- Look at these dinosaurs, they're all big. Where are all the little ones?\" (Laughter) And they thought about it\nand they even wrote papers about it: \"Where are the little dinosaurs?\" (Laughter) Well, go to a museum, you'll see, see how many baby dinosaurs there are. People assumed --\nand this was actually a problem -- people assumed\nthat if they had little dinosaurs, if they had juvenile dinosaurs,\nthey'd be easy to identify. You'd have a big dinosaur\nand a littler dinosaur. (Laughter) But all they had were big dinosaurs. And it comes down to a couple of things. First off, scientists have egos, and scientists like to name dinosaurs. They like to name anything. Everybody likes to have\ntheir own animal that they named. (Laughter) And so every time they found something\nthat looked a little different, they named it something different. And what happened, of course, is we ended up with a whole\nbunch of different dinosaurs. In 1975, a light went on in somebody's head. Dr. Peter Dodson\nat the University of Pennsylvania actually realized that dinosaurs\ngrew kind of like birds do, which is different\nthan the way reptiles grow. And in fact, he used the cassowary as an example. And it's kind of cool --\nif you look at the cassowary, or any of the birds\nthat have crests on their heads, they grow to about 80 percent adult size\nbefore the crest starts to grow. Now think about that. They're basically retaining\ntheir juvenile characteristics very late in what we call ontogeny. So allometric cranial ontogeny\nis relative skull growth. So you can see that if you actually found\none that was 80 percent grown and you didn't know that it was going\nto grow up to a cassowary, you would think\nthey were two different animals. So this was a problem, and Peter Dodson pointed this out\nusing some duck-billed dinosaurs then called Hypacrosaurus. And he showed that if you were to take\na baby and an adult and make an average\nof what it should look like, if it grew in sort of a linear fashion, it would have a crest\nabout half the size of the adult. But the actual subadult at 65 percent\nhad no crest at all. So this was interesting. So this is where people went astray again. I mean, if they'd have just taken that, taken Peter Dodson's work,\nand gone on with that, then we would have a lot less\ndinosaurs than we have. But scientists have egos;\nthey like to name things. And so they went on naming dinosaurs\nbecause they were different. Now we have a way of actually testing to see whether a dinosaur, or any animal,\nis a young one or an older one. And that's by actually\ncutting into their bones. But cutting into the bones of a dinosaur\nis hard to do, as you can imagine, because in museums, bones are precious. You go into a museum,\nand they take really good care of them. They put them in foam, little containers. They're very well taken care of. They don't like it if you come in\nand want to saw them open and look inside. (Laughter) So they don't normally let you do that. (Laughter) But I have a museum\nand I collect dinosaurs and I can saw mine open. So that's what I do. (Applause) So if you cut open a little dinosaur, it's very spongy inside, like A. And if you cut into an older dinosaur,\nit's very massive. You can tell it's mature bone. So it's real easy to tell them apart. So what I want to do is show you these. In North America in the northern plains\nof the United States and the southern plains\nof Alberta and Saskatchewan, there's this unit of rock\ncalled the Hell Creek Formation that produces the last\ndinosaurs that lived on Earth. And there are 12 of them\nthat everyone recognizes -- I mean the 12 primary dinosaurs\nthat went extinct. And so we will evaluate them. And that's sort of what I've been doing. So my students, my staff,\nwe've been cutting them open. Now as you can imagine,\ncutting open a leg bone is one thing, but when you go to a museum and say, \"You don't mind if I cut open\nyour dinosaur's skull, do you?\" they say, \"Go away.\" (Laughter) So here are 12 dinosaurs. And we want to look at these three first. So these are dinosaurs\nthat are called Pachycephalosaurus. And everybody knows\nthat these three animals are related. And the assumption is that they're related\nlike cousins or whatever. But no one ever considered\nthat they might be more closely related. In other words, people looked at them\nand they saw the differences. And you all know\nthat if you are going to determine whether you're related\nto your brother or your sister, you can't do it by looking at differences. You can only determine relatedness\nby looking for similarities. So people were looking at these and they were talking\nabout how different they are. Pachycephalosaurus has a big,\nthick dome on its head, and it's got some little bumps\non the back of its head, and it's got a bunch of gnarly things\non the end of its nose. And then Stygimoloch, another dinosaur\nfrom the same age, lived at the same time, has spikes sticking out\nthe back of its head. It's got a little, tiny dome, and it's got a bunch\nof gnarly stuff on its nose. And then there's this thing\ncalled Dracorex hogwartsia. Guess where that came from? Dragon. So here's a dinosaur that has spikes\nsticking out of its head, no dome and gnarly stuff on its nose. Nobody noticed the gnarly stuff\nsort of looked alike. But they did look at these three and they said, \"These\nare three different dinosaurs, and Dracorex is probably\nthe most primitive of them. And the other one\nis more primitive than the other.\" It's unclear to me how they actually\nsorted these three of them out. But if you line them up, if you just take those three skulls\nand just line them up, they line up like this. Dracorex is the littlest one, Stygimoloch is the middle-size one, Pachycephalosaurus is the largest one. And one would think,\nthat should give me a clue. (Laughter) But it didn't give them a clue. (Laughter) Because, well we know why. Scientists like to name things. So if we cut open Dracorex -- I cut open our Dracorex -- and look, it was spongy inside,\nreally spongy inside. I mean, it is a juvenile\nand it's growing really fast. So it is going to get bigger. If you cut open Stygimoloch,\nit is doing the same thing. The dome, that little dome,\nis growing really fast. It's inflating very fast. What's interesting is the spike\non the back of the Dracorex was growing very fast as well. The spikes on the back of the Stygimoloch\nare actually resorbing, which means they're getting smaller\nas that dome is getting bigger. And if we look at Pachycephalosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus has a solid dome and its little bumps on the back\nof its head were also resorbing. So just with these three dinosaurs, as a scientist, we can easily hypothesize that it is just a growth series\nof the same animal. Which of course means that Stygimoloch and Dracorex are extinct. (Laughter) OK. (Laughter) Which of course means\nwe have 10 primary dinosaurs to deal with. So a colleague of mine at Berkeley --\nhe and I were looking at Triceratops. And before the year 2000 -- now remember, Triceratops was first\nfound in the 1800s -- before 2000, no one had ever seen\na juvenile Triceratops. There's a Triceratops\nin every museum in the world, but no one had ever collected a juvenile. And we know why, right? Because everybody wants to have a big one. So everyone had a big one. So we went out and collected\na whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones. They're everywhere,\nthey're all over the place. So we have a whole bunch\nof them at our museum. (Laughter) And everybody says\nit's because I have a little museum. When you have a little museum,\nyou have little dinosaurs. (Laughter) If you look at the Triceratops, you can see it's changing,\nit's shape-shifting. As the juveniles are growing up,\ntheir horns actually curve backwards. And then as they get older,\nthe horns grow forward. And that's pretty cool. If you look along the edge of the frill, they have these little triangular bones\nthat actually grow big as triangles and then they flatten against the frill pretty much like the spikes do\non the Pachycephalosaurs. And then, because the juveniles\nare in my collection, I cut them open ... (Laughter) and look inside. And the little one is really spongy. And the middle-size one is really spongy. But what was interesting\nwas the adult Triceratops was also spongy. And this is a skull\nthat is two meters long. It's a big skull. But there's another dinosaur\nthat is found in this formation that looks like a Triceratops,\nexcept it's bigger, and it's called Torosaurus. And Torosaurus, when we cut\ninto it, has mature bone. But it's got these big\nholes in its shield. And everybody says, \"A Triceratops and a Torosaurus\ncan't possibly be the same animal because one of them's bigger\nthan the other one.\" (Laughter) \"And it has holes in its frill.\" And I said, \"Well do we have\nany juvenile Torosauruses?\" And they said, \"Well, no,\nbut it has holes in its frill.\" So one of my graduate\nstudents, John Scannella, looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole\nstarting to form in Triceratops and, of course it's open, in Torosaurus -- so he found the transitional ones\nbetween Triceratops and Torosaurus, which was pretty cool. So now we know that Torosaurus\nis actually a grown-up Triceratops. Now when we name dinosaurs, when we name anything,\nthe original name gets to stick and the second name is thrown out. So Torosaurus is extinct. Triceratops, if you've heard the news,\na lot of the newscasters got it all wrong. They thought Torosaurus should be kept\nand Triceratops thrown out, but that's not going to happen. (Laughter) All right, so we can do this\nwith a bunch of dinosaurs. I mean, here's Edmontosaurus and Anatotitan. Anatotitan: giant duck. It's a giant duck-bill dinosaur. Here's another one. So we look at the bone histology. The bone histology tells us\nthat Edmontosaurus is a juvenile, or at least a subadult, and the other one is an adult,\nand we have an ontogeny. And we get rid of Anatotitan. So we can just keep doing this. And the last one is T. Rex. So there's these two dinosaurs,\nT. Rex and Nanotyrannus. (Laughter) Again, it makes you wonder. (Laughter) But they had a good question. They were looking at them and they said,\n\"One's got 17 teeth, and the biggest one's got 12 teeth. And that doesn't make any sense at all, because we don't know of any dinosaurs\nthat gain teeth as they get older. So it must be true -- they must be different.\" So we cut into them. And sure enough,\nNanotyrannus has juvenile bone and the bigger one has more mature bone. It looks like it could still get bigger. And at the Museum\nof the Rockies where we work, I have four T. rexes,\nso I can cut a whole bunch of them. But I didn't have to cut\nany of them really, because I just lined up their jaws and it turned out\nthe biggest one had 12 teeth and the next smallest one had 13 and the next smallest had 14. And of course, Nano has 17. And we just went out and looked\nat other people's collections and we found one that has\nsort of 15 teeth. So again, real easy to say that Tyrannosaurus ontogeny\nincluded Nanotyrannus, and therefore we can take out\nanother dinosaur. (Laughter) So when it comes down\nto our end Cretaceous, we have seven left. And that's a good number. That's a good number\nto go extinct, I think. Now as you can imagine, this is not very popular\nwith fourth-graders. (Laughter) Fourth-graders love their dinosaurs,\nthey memorize them. And they're not happy with this. (Laughter) Thank you very much.

Farrell", "category": "Medical Conditions", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-bipolar-disorder-helen-m-farrell", "transcript": {"en": "What is bipolar disorder? The word bipolar means two extremes. For the many millions experiencing\nbipolar disorder around the world, life is split between \ntwo different realities - elation and depression. Although there are many variations\nof bipolar disorder, let's consider a couple. Type 1 has extreme highs\nalongside the lows, while Type 2 involves briefer, \nless extreme periods of elation interspersed with long periods\nof depression. For someone seesawing between\nemotional states, it can feel impossible to find the balance\nnecessary to lead a healthy life. Type 1's extreme highs are known\nas manic episodes, and they can make a person range from\nfeeling irritable to invincible. But these euphoric episodes exceed\nordinary feelings of joy, causing troubling symptoms \nlike racing thoughts, sleeplessness, rapid speech, impuslive actions, and risky behaviors. Without treatment, these episodes\nbecome more frequent, intense, and take longer to subside. The depressed phase of bipolar disorder\nmanifests in many ways - a low mood, dwindling interest in hobbies, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, restlessness or slowness, or persistent thoughts of suicide. Worldwide, about one \nto three percent of adults experience the broad range of symptoms\nthat indicate bipolar disorder. Most of those people are functional,\ncontributing members of society, and their lives, choices, \nand relationships aren't defined by the disorder, but still, for many, the consequences\nare serious. The illness can undermine educational\nand professional performance, relationships, financial security, and personal safety. So what causes bipolar disorder? Researchers think a key player is \nthe brain's intricate wiring. Healthy brains maintain strong connections\nbetween neurons thanks to the brain's continuous efforts\nto prune itself and remove unused or faulty\nneural connections. This process is important because our \nneural pathways serve as a map for everything we do. Using functional magnetic \nresonance imaging, scientists have discovered that the brain's \npruning ability is disrupted in people with bipolar disorder. That means their neurons go haywire and create a network\nthat's impossible to navigate. With only confusing signals as a guide, people with bipolar disorder develop\nabnormal thoughts and behaviors. Also, psychotic symptoms, like disorganized speech and behavior, delusional thoughts, paranoia, and hallucinations can emerge during extreme phases\nof bipolar disorder. This is attributed to the overabundance\nof a neurotransmitter called dopamine. But despite these insights, we can't pin\nbipolar disorder down to a single cause. In reality, it's a complex problem. For example, the brain's amygdala\nis involved in thinking, long-term memory, and emotional processing. In this brain region, factors as varied\nas genetics and social trauma may create abnormalities and trigger\nthe symptoms of bipolar disorder. The condition tends to run in families, so we do know that genetics have\na lot to do with it. But that doesn't mean there's\na single bipolar gene. In fact, the likelihood of developing\nbipolar disorder is driven by the interactions between\nmany genes in a complicated recipe we're still\ntrying to understand. The causes are complex, and consequently, diagnosing and living\nwith bipolar disorder is a challenge. Despite this, the disorder \nis controllable. Certain medications like lithium can help\nmanage risky thoughts and behaviors by stabilizing moods. These mood stabilizing medications work by\ndecreasing abnormal activity in the brain, thereby strengthening the viable\nneural connections. Other frequently used medications\ninclude antipsychotics, which alter the effects of dopamine, and electroconvulsive therapy, which works like a carefully controlled\nseizure in the brain, is sometimes used as \nan emergency treatment. Some bipolar patients reject treatment because they're afraid it will\ndim their emotions and destroy their creativity. But modern psychiatry is actively\ntrying to avoid that. Today, doctors work with patients\non a case-by-case basis to administer a combination of treatments\nand therapies that allows them to live \nto their fullest possible potential. And beyond treatment, people with\nbipolar disorder can benefit from even simpler changes. Those include regular exercise, good sleep habits, and sobriety from drugs and alcohol, not to mention the acceptance\nand empathy of family and friends. Remember, bipolar disorder \nis a medical condition, not a person's fault, or their whole identity, and it's something that can be controlled through a combination of medical \ntreatments doing their work internally, friends and family fostering acceptance\nand understanding on the outside, and people with bipolar disorder \nempowering themselves to find balance in their lives."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Bipolar disorder I requires the presence of at least one manic episode over a lifetime.

This statement\ncomes as a surprise to absolutely no one in my life. And so every time a new\nhealth claim about chocolate comes out in the news, I get\nabout five different emails in my inbox happily titled\nabout how chocolate is saving me from Alzheimer's and\nlowering my blood pressure or keeping me skinny. So before we talk about how\nyou can sift through the hype to find the science and decide\nwhat advice you are or are not going to take, let's\ntalk about chocolate. Chocolate begins as the seed\nof the cacao tree, which is fermented and cleaned\nand roasted and ground to create cocoa mass. The cocoa mass is then\nliquefied and separated into cocoa solids\nand cocoa butter. The ratio of cocoa solids to\nother ingredients in chocolate is what gives us a\nwide range of flavors. The darker the\nchocolate, the greater the amount of cocoa solids. These solids contain\nalkaloids like theobromine. Theobromine is a\nbitter, mild stimulant with a very similar\nshape to caffeine. This means that though\nthey are far, far milder, its effects on the body are very\nsimilar to those of caffeine. So let's take a look at one\nof the most recent chocolate health claims and see how\nyou can look at the science and sift through\nall the media hype to find out what's\nreally underneath. In August, a review\nof research was published that looked at\nthe link between chocolate and blood pressure. A summary of the review\nis available online. And I'll link it here-ish so\nthat you can go look at it yourself. I got this link from\none of the news articles I was reading about the study. So it's something that\nis readily available and that you can go\nand hunt down yourself. So the review is titled Effect\nof Cocoa on Blood Pressure. OK, that title makes sense. It says that researchers looked\nat 856 different patients from 20 different\nstudies who were all given flavanol-containing\nchocolate for trials ranging from two to 18 weeks. Here's where you\nwould have to do just a little bit of googling\nto find out that flavanols are compounds found in chocolate\nthat have been linked to heart health. They found that\nparticipants who were given flavanol-containing\ncocoa products-- often dark chocolates-- had a\nsmall but statistically significantly lowered\nchange in blood pressure. So that sounds OK-- more dark chocolate,\nlower blood pressure. But if you read a little\ndeeper into the study, you find that they\nknow that they found these drops in\nthe two-week trials, but not in the longer trials. They also note that they\nlooked for correlations among subgroups that maybe\nage played a role or sugar content of the chocolate\nor baseline blood pressure, but that anything\nthey did find would have to be studied further. In some, researchers did\na review and said, hey, there might be something here. We should study this. But the media took this\nand said, and I quote, \"dark chocolate and cocoa powder\nmay help lower blood pressure.\" OK, \"dark chocolate can\nlower your blood pressure without weight gain,\nsays new study.\" And my personal favorite,\n\"prescription chocolate, study may sway some docs.\" Now, none of this is to\nsay that the study is wrong or to criticize the media-- OK, a little bit-- or to say that you\nshouldn't eat chocolate. It's just to say\nthat sometimes it's good to look past the headlines\nand do a little poking around in the science yourself. This way, you can make your\nown informed decisions. And my decision? Go forth, do science."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Chocolate begins as the seed of the ______ tree.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cacao"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mango"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oak"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The darker the chocolate, the greater the amount of _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cocoa liquids"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cocoa solids"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Potassium"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Theobromine, found in chocolate, has a very similar molecular shape to ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ginseng"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Guarana"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Caffeine"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

When drought hit, she opened\nthe granaries to the public and passed a tax amnesty, all while preserving her kingdom's\nstability and independence with no revolts during \nthe rest of her reign.\" \"So what went wrong?\" \"After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen\ncouldn't stop meddling in Roman matters.\" \"Actually, it was the Roman factions who\ncame demanding her aid. And of course she had no choice\nbut to support Octavian and Marc Antony in avenging Caesar,\nif only for the sake of their son.\" \"And again, she provided her particular\nkind of support to Marc Antony.\" \"Why does that matter? Why doesn't anyone seem to care about Caesar or Antony's \ncountless other affairs? Why do we assume she instigated\nthe relationships? And why are only powerful women\ndefined by their sexuality?\" \"Order.\" \"Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster. They offended the Republic\nwith their ridiculous celebrations sitting on golden thrones and dressing up as gods until Octavian had all of Rome convinced\nof their megalomania.\" \"And yet Octavian was the one \nwho attacked Antony, annexed Egypt, and declared himself Emperor. It was the Roman's fear of a woman\nin power that ended their Republic, not the woman herself.\" \"How ironic.\" Cleopatra's story survived mainly\nin the accounts of her enemies in Rome, and later writers filled the gaps \nwith rumors and stereotypes.
