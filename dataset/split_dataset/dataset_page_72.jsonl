"[Music] good morning I would like to discuss with you your place in space now I'm not going to talk about black holes are gonna be no multiverses there will not even be plunk time I'm talking about fundamental astronomy that lets us know where we are in the cosmos our story begins on earth many people you know are from Earth including my father now my father was in law school in 1940 I don't want to shock anybody over here but he didn't really like it so he got a summer job working for the US Navy on earth on Wake Island now Wake Island is in the middle of Pacific Ocean nowhere so my dad was working for a contractor building an airstrip which is still there on Wake Island and they had a great time says it's the greatest summer job he ever had but then in the late fall of 1941 December 7th Wake Island was bombed same day as Pearl Harbor many other Pacific Ocean targets my father and his comrades fought back for two weeks and they shot down at least two Japanese bombers every day for two weeks but they the Japanese Navy eventually showed up with foe Atilla many ships and they captured everybody on Christmas Eve my dad wrote in his diary saddest day of my life well they were taken to China someplace and my dad was in prison camp for almost four years 44 months longer than anyone else from the United States and he had very dark skies at night they had no electricity and the Japanese military confiscated all their jewelry and watches and so on so they had no way to tell time so the family myth is my dad would tell time by sticking a shovel handle in the dirt and watching the shadow he watched the shadows of sticks and Pera they would tell the guard what it was and when it was time to eat lunch and he was also the family myth able to infer when you know the time of year they're able to figure out their latitude so this guy who my dad said wasn't even this tall was able to crawl through a vent in this train car and get back to the east coast of China and make it all the way to the United States and tell everybody what happened because these guys essentially disappeared I mean I don't know why they didn't tweet where they were just or use Facebook but eventually the deal is my dad lived through it and he got back to the states he married his college sweetheart Here I am along with my older brother and sister and through all this my father became fascinated with sundials so yes he created the well known sand dial which you take to the beach so you don't have to get sand in your watch Oh everybody needs one believe me and then he wrote articles for the Washington DC area newspapers and he eventually wrote a book about sundials and that's when he was given a lifetime membership in the North American sundial Society anybody now ecology does tell you there's a lot of CFO's here chief financial officers a lot of operating there's a lot of accountants and you know how the accountants can party it's crazy yeah well let me tell you it when you're with the sundial people it is nuts man I mean everybody's it's movie look it's moving so so I of course was a rebellious teenager and so on but I did notice that last summer I brought out one of the old sand aisles and seemed to still work just fine and someone I know converted a conventional pizza box into a polar sundial now this might be evidence of a Saudi sundial obsessive disorder but I'm fine now I'm fine I could quit if I wanted I just don't want to that's all so I got invited to a meeting many years ago at Cornell University and they had this thing this is the test pattern for the cameras that were going to Mars this is the photometric calibration target and I think you can see their color coupons that you get the colors right and there are three gray rings of different values and so they were casting a shadow with this little metal post so you could look at the color of the Martian sky now if you look at the at a shadow on earth that's something very white you'll see it's blue just a little bit from the Earth's sky so I'm in this meeting and I go you guys we gotta turn the photometric calibration target into a sundial and they're looking at me no you guys it'll be cool we can reckon time on another world it'll be like speaking Klingon except it'll be real and so the head guy Steve Squire said okay so my friends there are two sundials on Mars while we're here so here's what I want you to do when you go to Mars next time and you're standing there you got to take some food and water it's 687 Earth days you will see the Sun make this pattern through the sky as the year goes on if you do it on earth you will see this pattern that's I started on the 2nd of March it'll go north and this pattern is called the analemma the analemma zone Latin word that means the pedestal of niall so what I want you guys to do is to build one of these and so what we have done if you go to our website Planetary org and we'll find the instructions for laying out the lines and getting the hours right for your sundial anywhere in the world you can furnish it anything that's not on the dial to tell time is its furniture you can furnish it with here some sailboats and anchors and here's the traditional latitude and longitude and it's the ping-pong ball is the gnomon because ping-pong balls are available anywhere in the world so we did this back in 2004 when the Spirit and Opportunity Rovers landed on Mars and people all over the world built these but those days webcams were kind of a hassle this year we're hoping it will be really cool so here's what I'm telling you almost everybody has observed the Sun go up and down as the year goes on in the sky very few of us have heard the word analemma yet we all depend on it you go to office supply stores you get your calendars with the kittens and the puppies and the firefighters with no shirts on and all of that has figured out we had a leap day this year all of that is figured out by knowing intimately our relationship to the Sun knowing intimately our place in space so I submit to you my friends if you take the time you can dare I say it change the world thank you all very much thank you [Applause]"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What happened on December 7, 1941?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wake Island was bombed, the same day as Pearl Harbor"}, {"label":

The Ladder of Inference, which was first proposed\nby Harvard professor Chris Argyris, is the basis of this model. Every time we interact with someone, that experience\nenters the ladder at the bottom. That same experience zips up\nthe ladder in the blink of an eye, exiting at the top. This process happens\nthousands of times a day without us knowing it. Let's focus on what happens\non each rung of the ladder. On the first rung, we have the raw data\nand observations of our experience. This is very similar to what someone\nwatching a video recording of our experience would see. Moving up to the second rung, we filter in specific information\nand details from our experience. We unknowingly filter\nbased on our preferences, tendencies, and many other aspects\nthat we believe are important. On to the third rung. We assign meaning to the information\nwe have filtered through. This is where we start to interpret\nwhat our information is telling us. On our fourth rung,\na very crucial thing happens. We develop assumptions based on the meaning\nwe created on the previous rung, and we start to blur the distinction\nbetween what is fact and what is story. On the fifth rung, we develop conclusions\nbased on our assumptions. This is also where\nour emotional reactions are created. On the sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs\nabout the world around us, including the person or people involved in our experience of the moment. On the seventh and final rung, we take action\nbased on our adjusted beliefs. Still with me? Great! Let's take a real-life example and run it up the ladder\nto see how this all works. Have you ever been cut off\nin a parking lot, signal light on as you steer toward your coveted spot, only to slam on your brakes\nat the last minute as someone pulls in front of you\nand steals your spot away? Imagine that experience\nand notice all of the data and observations landing\non the first rung of your ladder. Now let's watch what we pay attention to\non the second rung. Who cares that it's sunny out\nand the birds are chirping? The 50% off sign outside\nof your favorite store is meaningless. You filter in the sensation\nof your grip tightening on the wheel, you feel your blood pressure rise, you hear the squeal of your brakes, and you notice the expression\non the face of the other driver as he pulls in front of you\nand quickly looks away. Time for our third rung. Ever since you were young, your parents taught you\nthe importance of waiting in line and taking your turn. You live and die by the rule\nof first come, first served. And now this guy\nhas just stolen your spot. What gives? Up to the fourth rung we go. Watch closely as our assumptions take over and our story creates itself. \"That stupid jerk, didn't his parents\nteach him anything? How could he not see my signal light? He must never pay attention! Why does he think he's more important\nthan anyone else?\" Jumping quickly to the fifth rung, we conclude that this guy\nis heartless, inconsiderate, he needs to be taught a lesson\nand put in his place. We feel angry, frustrated,\nvindictive, justified. On our sixth rung, we adjust our beliefs\nbased on the experience. \"That's the last time I give in! Next time someone tries to cut me off, tires will be smoking on the pavement as I squeal past them into my spot.\" And finally our last rung: we take action. We back up, pull up behind his car, honk our horn, and roll down our window to scream a few choice words as well. Now imagine, he walks over quickly, apologizing. His wife, who's almost due\nwith their first baby, called him from inside the mall\nto say she is in labor and needs to get\nto the hospital immediately. We're momentarily shocked,\napologize profusely, and wish him luck\nas he rushes toward the entrance. What just happened here? What changed? Why is this so significant? In our parking lot example, our beliefs were short-circuited\nby the ladder of the other individual. \"My wife is in labor,\nI need to get there quick, there's a parking spot. Whew! Oh, jeez, I cut someone off. I'd better apologize quickly\nso they don't think I'm a jerk.\" But what if we were able\nto short-circuit our ladders ourselves? Proactively, by choice? Guess what? We can! Let's return to our unique\nhuman function of free will. Next time you notice yourself\nreacting to your experience, pay focused attention to your ladder. Ask yourself what beliefs are at play, where do they come from? What data and observations\ndid you filter in as a result of your beliefs, and why? Are your assumptions valid\nand supported by facts? Would a different set of assumptions\ncreate different feelings, and result in new and better\nconclusions and actions? We all have our own unique ladder. Be mindful of yours, and help others to see theirs."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who first proposed the Ladder of Inference?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A Lithuanian tapestry artist, Wilton Marquis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A Harvard professor, Chris Argyris"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The famous film critic, Gene Siskel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Austrian nerologist, Sigmund Freud"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The first (bottom) rung of the Ladder of Inference focuses on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Filtering information and details"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Assigning meaning to information"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Observing raw data"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Determining our main goal"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Ladder of Inference helps us understand how we can better control and manage our emotions by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Paying attention to the information we filter in and filtering out undesirable information"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Consciously examining the assumptions and conclusions that cause our emotional responses"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Recognizing how our emotions have influenced the action we take and apologizing where appropriate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reminding us that everyone has good days and bad days and emotions are bound to get the best of us at times"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the story of the inconsiderate driver in the parking lot, the main point (in terms of the Ladder of Inference) is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Our parents have a huge influence on our values and beliefs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Almost everyone is understandably thoughtless and inconsiderate when they are under stress"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The high-pressure and time crunched world we live in today means that we can’t help but react negatively to some situations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Understanding our assumptions and potential alternatives for these assumptions can change our emotional response and our subsequent behavior"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "On the second rung of the Ladder of Inference, we filter in specific information and details because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "We have to decide what is most important to pay attention to or we would be overwhelmed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Our subconscious preferences and tendencies automatically do this for us without thinking"}, {"label": "C", "text": "We are watching for certain patterns of information and details that help us make sense of our experience"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Our minds try to arrange things in a logical and understandable order"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

The winds and currents pushed and pulled ships off course, and so sailors based their directions on the port they left, attempting to maintain an accurate record of the ship's direction and the distance sailed. This process was known as dead reckoning, because being just half a degree off could result in sailing right past the island that lay several miles just over the horizon. This was an easy mistake to make. Thankfully, three inventions made modern navigation possible: sextants, clocks and the mathematics necessary to perform the required calculations quickly and easily. All are important. Without the right tools, many sailors would be reluctant to sail too far from the sight of land. John Bird, an instrument maker in London, made the first device that could measure the angle between the sun and the horizon during the day, called a sextant. Knowing this angle was important, because it could be compared to the angle back in England at the exact same time. Comparing these two angles was necessary to determine the longitude of the ship. Clocks came next. In 1761, John Harrison, an English clockmaker and carpenter, built a clock that could keep accurate time at sea. The timepiece that could maintain accurate time while on a pitching, yawing deck in harsh conditions was necessary in order to know the time back in England. There was one catch though: since such a timepiece was handmade, it was very expensive. So an alternate method using lunar measurements and intense calculations was often used to cut costs. The calculations to determine a ship's location for each measurement could take hours. But sextants and clocks weren't useful unless sailors could use these tools to determine their position. Fortunately, in the 1600s, an amateur mathematician had invented the missing piece. John Napier toiled for more than 20 years in his castle in Scotland to develop logarithms, a calculation device. Napier's ideas on logarithms involved the form of one over E and the constant 10 to the seventh power. Algebra in the early 1600s was not fully developed, and Napier's logarithm of one did not equal zero. This made the calculations much less convenient than logarithms with a base of 10. Henry Briggs, a famous mathematician at Gresham College in London, read Napier's work in 1614, and the following year made the long journey to Edinburgh to meet Napier. Briggs showed up unannounced at Napier's castle door and suggested that John switch the base and form of his logarithms into something much simpler. They both agreed that a base of 10 with the log of one equal to zero would greatly simplify everyday calculations. Today we remember these as Briggs Common Logarithms. Until the development of electric calculating machines in the 20th century, any calculations involving multiplication, division, powers, and extraction of roots with large and small numbers were done using logarithms. The history of logarithms isn't just a lesson in math. There were many players responsible for successful navigation. Instrument makers, astronomers, mathematicians, and of course sailors. Creativity isn't only about going deep into one's field of work, it's about cross-pollination between disciplines too."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately 400 years ago, ships attempted to maintain an accurate record of direction, time, and distance.

Your body does it on its own, from the day you're born until the day you die. You have muscles contract to bring oxygen, a gas, into your lungs, which is then transferred by your bloodstream to every cell in your body. Gases are strange. We can't see them, but we know they're there because we can feel them. What we experience as wind is really trillions and trillions of gas molecules slamming into your body. And it feels good, right? Science is based on observation. Unfortunately, we cannot observe gases with our eyes -- they're too small. We have to use our other senses to make observations and draw conclusions. Observations are then compiled, and we create a model. No, not that kind of model. A model is a way scientists describe the properties of physical phenomena. First, gases always move in a straight line. We don't really have anything to demonstrate this with because gravity always pulls objects down. So imagine a bullet fired from a gun, and that bullet goes on at a constant speed in a perfectly straight line. That would be like a gas molecule. Second, gases are so small, they occupy no volume on their own. As a group they do, blow up any balloon and you can see how that volume changes. But single gases have no volume compared to other forms of matter. Rather than calculating such a small amount of matter, we just call it zero for simplicity. Third, if gas molecules collide, and they do -- remember, these are assumptions -- their energy remains constant. An easy way to demonstrate this is by dropping a soccer ball with a tennis ball balanced on top. Because the soccer ball is bigger, it has more potential energy, and the energy from the larger ball is transferred to the smaller tennis ball and it flies away when that energy is transferred. The total energy stays the same. Gases work the same way. If they collide, smaller particles will speed up, larger particles will slow down. The total energy is constant. Fourth, gases do not attract one another, and they don't like to touch. But remember rule three. In reality, they do collide. Finally, gases have energy that is proportional to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the higher the energy the gases have. The crazy thing is that at the same temperature, all gases have the same energy. It doesn't depend on the type of gas, just the temperature that gas is at. Keep in mind this is a model for the way gas particles behave, and based on our observations, gases always move in straight lines. They're so small, that they're not measurable on their own, and they don't interact with one another. But if they do bump into one another, that energy is transferred from one particle to another, and the total amount never changes. Temperature has a major effect, and in fact, all gases at the same temperature have the same average energy. Whew!

Did you know all chemical matter follows certain laws as well? In fact, we can describe those laws by looking at relationships. Some easy laws to begin with are the ones that govern the gases. Back in 1662, Robert Boyle realized that gases had an interesting response when he put them into containers and changed their volume. Take an empty bottle and put the cap on it, closing that container. Now squeeze your bottle, and what happens? The pressure inside the bottle increases when the size of the container decreases. You can only crush that container so much until the gases inside push back on your hand. This is called an inverse proportion, and it changes at the same rate for every gas. Boyle's law allows chemists to predict the volume of any gas at any given pressure because the relationship is always the same. In 1780, Jacques Charles noticed a different relationship between gases and their temperature. If you've ever seen a hot-air balloon, you've seen this law in action. When the ballons are laid out, they're totally flat. Instead of blowing the balloon up like a party balloon, they use a giant flame to heat the air inside that envelope. As the air is heated up, the balloon begins to inflate as the gas volume increases. The hotter the gas becomes, the larger the volume, and that's Charles' law. Notice this law is different from Boyle's. Charles' law is a direct relationship. As the temperature increases, the volume increases as well. The third law is also easily demonstrated. When you're blowing up party balloons, the volume increases. As you are blowing, you're forcing more and more gas particles into the balloon from your lungs. This causes the balloon volume to increase. This is Avogadro's law in action. As the number of particles of gas added to a container are increased, the volume will increase as well. If you add too many particles, well, you know what happens next. Laws are everywhere, even in the tiniest particles of gas. If you squeeze them, the pressure will increase as the particles are pushed together. Low volume means a high pressure because those particles push back. As the temperature increases, gases move away from one another, and the volume increases as well. Finally, if you add gas to a closed container, that container's volume will expand. But be careful not to add too much, because otherwise you could end up with a burst balloon."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does the pressure of a container change as the volume is changed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As volume increases, pressure increases as well.

In short order, books, which had been a rarity, were now becoming a widespread phenomenon. All that new reading material meant more knowledge was circulating, but it also meant that more people were straining their eyes, likely as they read by candlelight. And while spectacles had been invented in Italy around 1286, the need for reading glasses increased substantially. Now that people could use lenses to see things more clearly, they started wondering if vision could be enhanced to see things the human eye couldn't perceive by its own devices. Robert Hooke pursued microscopy, and 1665 he published his findings of worlds inside worlds, which he called \"cells\" in the book \"Micrographia.\" At the other end of the spectrum, Galileo innovated with telescopic lenses, and in 1609, he had refined a telescope until he had an instrument powerful enough to see distant objects in the sky with an accuracy no one had before him. He found that the moon had craters and mountains, that Jupiter had moons of its own, and the whole system governing the earth and space was brought into question. Not everyone was thrilled with all the things Galileo saw though. For instance, it was taught at the time that the moon was a perfectly smooth sphere. Yet here was visual proof that was awfully hard to discount. Upon finding moons around Jupiter, he also verified what Johannes Kepler had surmised: that the earth was not the center of the universe, dispelling another central dogma of Galileo's day. Then almost exactly a year after Galileo died, Isaac Newton was born. A lot that had been unknown was visible by now, but much of it was simply the foundation for further questions. What was light anyway? And color, for that matter? What were the laws that governed the earth, and the heavens? And could we capture them through keen observation? Newton experimented extensively with optics, and came to understand light as something of substance, and colors as components of light at different frequencies. Before Newton, people widely believed that the color was due to different amounts of light, with red being lots of light, and blue being mostly dark. Newton's prism experiments showed that white light could not only be broken into its component colors with one prism, but that a second lens could recompose those colors back into white light again, thus showing that color was a matter of light's refraction rather than how light or dark it was. Newton's studies of optics led to the development of the reflecting telescope. This, together with his study of planetary motion, led to his theory of gravitation, one of the world's greatest examples of learning to see something invisible by observing its effect on things that are visible. So fast forward a few hundred years, and here we stand. We've evolved from a single lens to optics that reveal the birth of a star in another galaxy, or a child developing in the womb, or an electron whirling around an atom. At a time when so much is visible, how we see the world around us matters even more than what we see. Will we see a world where everything important has already been discovered? Or will we see one in which yesterday's discoveries are but a doorway to the breakthroughs of tomorrow?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Interestingly, it wasn't scientific interest, but more practical matters that led to the initial advancement in optics.

{"page": 72, "lesson": 7, "title": "How breathing works - Nirvair Kaur", "category": "Physical Fitness", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-breathing-works-nirvair-kaur", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar We take a breath every few seconds. Our life depends upon inhaling oxygen, but we never think about how we breathe. It just seems to happen automatically. How can something that seems so simple be the key to keeping us alive? Breathing starts with the environment around us. The air we breathe in, or inspire, has a mixture of gases including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen, which is the most important for our survival. It enters our body through the nose and mouth, moves down into the pharynx, trachea and bronchial tubes, and ultimately reaches the alveoli air sacs in the lungs. The alveoli use pressure to move oxygen and nutrients into the blood. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles are a pumping system that facilitates this air exchange. How you breathe affects your energy level, especially when you are under physical or emotional stress. Think back to the last difficult test you had to take. It's likely that as you became more nervous, the tension in your body increased, and your breathing quickly sped up. The shallower our breath, the less oxygen that reaches our brain, and the harder it is to focus. What's our response to physical stress, like a fast-paced game of field hockey after school? As we exert pressure on our bodies, the muscles require a great deal of energy and demand additional oxygen. Our panting breath starts to kick in, which creates pressure to draw in more air and oxygen to the body, and regulates body temperature by allowing it to cool down naturally. These aren't the only times our breathing is affected or altered. Think about the last time you got angry or emotional. Anger creates a metabolic reaction in the body, which stresses it out and heats up our internal temperature. Have you ever seen anyone lose their cool? Ultimately, if we're breathing under stress over long periods of time, there are consequences. When the cells of a body aren't getting the oxygen they need, the nutrients available to the body decrease and toxins build up in the blood. It is thought that a hypoxic, or oxygen-poor environment, can increase cancerous cells. The good news is that we can control our breath much more than we realize. This means we can increase both the quality and quantity of the breath. The science of breathing has been around for thousands of years, from ancient yogis in India to respiratory therapists working with patients today. Both would tell you that there are specific techniques that will help you improve your breathing. Breathing is all about moving air from a higher-pressure to a lower-pressure environment. More breath means more oxygen, and ultimately a greater amount of nutrients that's available for our cells and blood. We naturally do this when we let out a big sigh. Changing the air pressure going into the lungs is one of the main ways to alter breathing. Our body automatically does this when we cough, sneeze, or have the hiccups. Here's a simple experiment. Close off your right nostril with your right thumb. Breathe in and out just through the left nostril. Notice how much harder it is to get the breath in. You have to focus your attention, and use your diaphragm and muscles much more than normal. By decreasing the surface area of the airways, you're increasing the pressure of oxygen moving from the alveoli to the blood. Yogis often practice alternate nostril breathing to slow down the breath, increase oxygen, and activate the body's parasympathetic nervous system, which deals with the body's operations when it's at rest. Let's try another exercise. Visualize the way a dog pants when it breathes. Now try doing the same type of panting, first with your tongue out, then with your mouth closed. You will find yourself using your stomach muscles to push the air out as you exhale. Place your hand under your nose, and you'll feel the strength of the breath coming out. Breathing this way is hard because it requires an active movement of our diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Our body temperature changes quickly during this exercise from the amount of pressure we are exerting on our breath. It's no surprise that you'll find dogs doing this breath often to cool down on a hot day. When we sleep at night, the medulla center of the brain makes sure that we keep breathing. Lucky for us we don't have to think about it. During the day, our breath is much more vulnerable, especially under stressful or difficult situations. That's why it's helpful to pay attention to your breathing. If you can monitor and change your breath, you can improve both the quality and quantity of oxygen that enters your body. This lowers stress, increases energy, and strengthens your immune system. So the next time someone tells you to relax and take a deep breath, you'll know exactly why."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The scientific term for the process of breathing in air is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Aspire"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Retire"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inspire"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Circulate"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Ambulate"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do the alveoli in the lungs move oxygen and nutrients into the bloodstream?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Diffusion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Magnetic Force"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Time"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Pressure"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Panting breath regulates the body’s temperature by allowing it to naturally:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heat up"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cool down"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increase circulation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Deactivate the sweat glands"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Breathe only through the nose"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does a ‘hypoxic’ cell environment mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oxygen-poor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "High pressure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Low pressure"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Life-giving"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which part of the brain controls our breathing when we sleep?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cerebellum"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pineal Gland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Medulla"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ocular nerve"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Sinuses"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

All so different in form and function, but amazingly the same in how their form and function are determined. First, all these organisms are made of one or more cells, and every cell of every living thing on earth contains all the information it takes to create and duplicate and make variations of itself. That information is stored in a very long but quite simple double molecule called DNA, or Deoxyribonucleic Acid. And the DNA of every living organism is made of chains of four smaller molecules called nucleotides. What dictates the difference between a man and a mushroom is the sequence of these nucleotides in the long DNA chain. The four differing nucleotide parts, called bases, are made of a few carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and phosphorus atoms, and the molecules look like this. And each of these four bases is attached to an identical backbone molecule, a sugar called deoxyribose - the \"D\" in DNA - and a phosphate group. Let's simplify these nucleotides and show them like this. So, a single sequence of nucleotides joined by their common sugars would look like this. And the DNA molecule where such sequences are stored looks like this. But how does a simple molecule dictate the form and function of millions of different living things? You can think of DNA as a great library of information, information that is used to do one thing and one thing only: direct the building of different protein molecules. And it's the proteins that build the cells and keep them functioning and changing and reproducing. Here's where the familiar word 'gene' comes in. If your DNA is a library of information, a gene is a book in that library. A gene is a segment of the DNA molecule. Let's say your body needs a particular protein, like insulin. To get it, some of your cells send a protein signal through the bloodstream to the cells in your pancreas, where insulin is made. That signal protein tells other proteins in the cell's nuclei to open up a part of the DNA double helix, the insulin gene, and start making insulin proteins. As soon as enough insulin has been produced, another signal protein comes to the pancreas' cells that tells them to stop making insulin. It's like looking up a book in the DNA library about insulin, and then putting it back when you're done. There are genes in DNA for visible and invisible things that make up your body, like genes for eye color, protein pigments, for skin color, for hair color, for stopping and starting bone growth, for your blood type, for how many fingers or arms and legs you have, for proteins that influence how long you live. Your DNA probably contains between 25 thousand and 40 thousand genes, while the DNA of a worm or a plant or a fruit fly contains about 12 thousand to 20 thousand genes. Some of those genes have quite different sequences of nucleotides than yours, and some are similar to yours. Though it happens infrequently, our own nucleotide sequences can change as the result of spontaneous or environmental damage which might remove or shift a nucleotide position. This changes the gene involved, and can then change the protein. Most of these changes, called mutations, have very little effect on the organism or its descendants. some are mildly damaging, and a few can make the organism better-suited to its environment. It is these tiny changes in DNA gene sequences, happening over millions of years, that create the differences among living organisms, from geckos to grasshoppers. worms to watermelons, elephants to Escherichia Coli, and man to mushroom."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Every cell of every living thing on earth contains all the information it needs to create and duplicate and make variations of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "itself"}, {"label": "B", "text": "any other kind of cell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "red blood cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "proteins"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "DNA is made of chains of four smaller molecules called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "nucleotides"}, {"label": "B", "text": "mitochondrial bases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "life blocks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "DNAblers"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The four differing nucleotide parts, called bases, are made of a few:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carbon and oxygen atoms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hydrogen atoms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nitrogen and phosphorus atoms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "You can think of DNA as a great library of information that exists to do one thing only.

So how does CO2 get into our atmosphere? Well, carbon is part of a cycle. It starts with the sun, which heats the Earth's surface with more energy in one hour than the whole world uses in a year. Plants, which are kind of like biological chefs, take that sunlight, and then suck in some CO2 from the air, mix them together, and BAM! They create a stored form of energy, in the form of carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose. The process is called photosynthesis. When animals like us eat those plants our stomachs convert that food back into energy for our own growth. Greenhouse gases are a byproduct of this process, and are released through waste. If those plants die, they decompose, and tiny microorganisms break down those carbohydrates and again, release greenhouse gases as a byproduct. As you see, energy originates from the sun. It is then transferred as it moves through the food chain. But sometimes, carbon based organisms like plants or animals get stuck in the earth. When this happens, they're compressed under tons of pressure, and turned into carbon-based fossil fuels like oil, coal or natural gas. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been pulling those fossil fuels out of the ground and burning them, activating the stored energy to make electricity and power engines. But the thing is it also releases millions of years worth of stored CO2 back into the air. In addition, humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out CO2. But plants do the opposite. Trees suck up huge amounts of CO2, which balances the cycle. Thus, deforestation reduces the plants that store CO2. We're attacking the cycle from both sides. Think of it like a computer. A computer can operate a few programs at a time, right? Normally, when you've finished with a document, you save, and you close it, so as not to overwork the computer. Then, imagine you stopped closing your documents. So they were all open at once. Your computer wouldn't be able to process it all. It would start to slow down, and then to freeze, and eventually it would crash. Which might be where our environment is heading if we keep overloading the carbon cycle. So is there any way to rebalance the ecosystem? What about technology? Technology is defined as a technique to solve a problem. And so, sustainable technologies are those whose output is equal to their input. They do not create negative externalities, such as CO2, in the present or the future. They sort of cancel themselves out to solve the problem. To achieve this, we need to invent sustainable technologies. If we put all the ideas and technologies ever created into one circle, then invention is the pushing of the boundaries of that circle. And the area outside of the circle is infinite, meaning the potential for invention is limitless. Think about some of the incredible clean technologies we have today. [Wind; Electric & Solar Cars; Biogas] [Biofuels; Photosynthetic Algae; Compost] All those ideas have one thing in common. They all came from people. People innovate. People create. It's the limitless potential of creative people to build unimagined technologies that is going to stop climate change and rebalance the ecosystem.

While there are several factors that might go into deciding\nwhere to place your business, clusters of similar companies can\nbe explained by a very simple story called Hotelling's Model\nof Spatial Competition. Imagine that you sell\nice cream at the beach. Your beach is one mile long\nand you have no competition. Where would you place your cart\nin order to sell the most product? In the middle. The one-half-mile walk may\nbe too far for some people at each end of the beach, but your cart serves\nas many people as possible. One day you show up at work just as your cousin Teddy\nis arriving at the beach with his own ice cream cart. In fact, he's selling exactly the same type\nof ice cream as you are. You agree that you will split\nthe beach in half. In order to ensure that customers\ndon't have to walk too far you set up your cart a quarter mile\nsouth of the beach center, right in the middle of your territory. Teddy sets up a quarter mile\nnorth of the center, in the middle of Teddy territory. With this agreement, everyone south\nof you buys ice cream from you. Everyone north of Teddy buys from him,\nand the 50% of beachgoers in between walk to the closest cart. No one walks\nmore than a quarter of a mile, and both vendors sell\nto half of the beachgoers. Game theorists consider\nthis a socially optimal solution. It minimizes the maximum number\nof steps any visitor must take in order to reach an ice cream cart. The next day, when you arrive at work, Teddy has set up his cart\nin the middle of the beach. You return to your location\na quarter mile south of center and get the 25% of customers\nto the south of you. Teddy still gets all of the customers\nnorth in Teddy territory, but now you split the 25% of people\nin between the two carts. Day three of the ice cream wars,\nyou get to the beach early, and set up right in the center\nof Teddy territory, assuming you'll serve\nthe 75% of beachgoers to your south, leaving your cousin to sell\nto the 25% of customers to the north. When Teddy arrives,\nhe sets up just south of you stealing all of the southerly customers, and leaving you with a small group\nof people to the north. Not to be outdone, you move 10 paces\nsouth of Teddy to regain your customers. When you take a mid-day break,\nTeddy shuffles 10 paces south of you, and again, steals back all the customers\nto the far end of the beach. Throughout the course of the day, both of you continue\nto periodically move south towards the bulk of the ice cream buyers, until both of you eventually end up\nat the center of the beach, back to back, each serving 50%\nof the ice-cream-hungry beachgoers. At this point, you\nand your competitive cousin have reached what game theorists\ncall a Nash Equilibrium - the point where neither of you\ncan improve your position by deviating from your current strategy. Your original strategy, where you were each a quarter mile\nfrom the middle of the beach, didn't last, because it wasn't\na Nash Equilibrium. Either of you could move your cart\ntowards the other to sell more ice cream.

When it healed, and Jim's fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self conscious about his injury.\" \"All this happened, more or less. The war parts, anyway, are pretty much true. One guy I knew really was shot in Dresden for taking a teapot that wasn't his.\" \"My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than 'Pip.' So I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.\" Imagery, intrigue, emotion: each introduction makes you want to read more. If you have an assignment to write a literary analysis, your introduction will be just as important. There will be four elements in your essay: your introduction, thesis statement, analysis and conclusion. If you begin writing a literary analysis with the introduction, you may be discouraged. Here's a tip for writing a great introduction: Write it last, and write your thesis first. Figure out what you want to analyze before you actually analyze it. Your thesis is the foundation for the rest of your essay, including your introduction. So how do you find your thesis? Start by asking questions. To Charles Dickens you may ask, \"why do you draw attention to characters' hands?\" \"What's up with their names?\" \"Pumblechook? Really?\" To narrow your concept for analysis, answer the questions yourself. \"Estella ridicules Pip's hands, Jaggers constantly washes his hands, Pip insufferably burns his hands, Mrs. Joe brings Pip up by hand.\" Are there patterns in your answers? \"Estella's comments smack of cruelty, while Jaggers' cleanses his immoral conscience. Pip finds a second chance, while Mrs. Joe abuses a child under the guise of love and dedication.\" What can you analyze with this pattern? \"Hands symbolize social class inequities, and through Dickens' criticism, he exposes the dire need for reform in Victorian London. What you will do next, which is an entirely different lesson, is to draft and revise your analysis. Only after you write your analysis, return to your introduction. Like authors earlier, try to intrigue and inspire your reader. Avoid starting with famous quotations, dictionary definitions or rhetorical questions. Consider the historical context of your topic, or an anecdote or some larger idea or concept. Here's an example: \"27 bones in the hand and wrist allow humans to concurrently create and destroy. Thousands of hands have been behind history's astounding creations. Hands represent a powerful symbol, one that was not lost on Charles Dickens. In Great Expectations, Dickens uses hands to symbolize social class inequities, and through his criticism, he exposes the dire need for social reform in Victorian London.\" Take time crafting and revising your thesis and introduction.

{"page": 72, "lesson": 12, "title": "What's invisible? More than you think - John Lloyd", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-invisible-more-than-you-think-john-lloyd", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar (Circus music) [Ted N' Ed's Carnival] [John Lloyd's Inventory of the Invisible] [Adapted from a TEDTalk\ngiven by John Lloyd in 2009] June Cohen: Our next speaker\nhas spent his whole career eliciting that sense of wonder. Please welcome John Lloyd. (Applause) [Hall of Mirrors] The question is, \"What is invisible?\" There's more of it\nthan you think, actually. Everything, I would say --\neverything that matters -- Except every thing, and except matter. We can see matter but we can't see what's the matter. We can see the stars and the planets\nbut we can't see what holds them apart, or what draws them together. With matter as with people,\nwe see only the skin of things, we can't see into the engine room,\nwe can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty, and the closer we look at anything,\nthe more it disappears. In fact, if you look\nreally closely at stuff, if you look at the basic\nsubstructure of matter, there isn't anything there. Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,\nand there is only energy. One of the interesting things\nabout invisibility is, the things that we can's see,\nwe also can't understand. Gravity is one thing that we can't see,\nand which we don't understand. It's the least understood\nof all the four fundamental forces, and the weakest, and nobody really\nknows what it is or why it's there. For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton,\nthe greatest scientist who ever lived, he thought Jesus came\nto Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity. That's what he thought he was there for. So, bright guy, could be wrong\non that one, I don't know. (Laughter) Consciousness. I see all your faces;\nI've no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing? Isn't it incredible that we can't read\neach other's minds, when we can touch each other,\ntaste each other, perhaps, if we get close enough,\nbut we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. In the Sufi faith,\nthis great Middle Eastern religion which some claim\nis the root of all religions, Sufi masters are\nall telepaths, so they say, but their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals\nto the rest of us that it doesn't exist. So that's why we don't think it exists;\nthe Sufi masters working on us. In the question of consciousness\nand artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence has really,\nlike the study of consciousness, gotten nowhere, we have no idea\nhow consciousness works. Not only have they not created\nartificial intelligence, they haven't yet created\nartificial stupidity. (Laughter) The laws of physics: invisible,\neternal, omnipresent, all powerful. Remind you of anyone? Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,\nnot a materialist, I'm an immaterialist. And I've found a very useful\nnew word -- ignostic. Okay? I'm an ignostic. [God?] I refuse to be drawn on the question\non whether God exists until somebody properly defines the terms. Another thing we can't see\nis the human genome. And this is increasingly peculiar,\nbecause about 20 years ago when they started delving into the genome,\nthey thought it would probably contain around 100 thousand genes. Every year since,\nit's been revised downwards. We now think there are likely\nto be just over 20 thousand genes in the human genome. This is extraordinary,\nbecause rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes. Potatoes have 48 chromosomes,\ntwo more than people, and the same as a gorilla. (Laughter) You can't see these things,\nbut they are very strange. The stars by day, I always\nthink that's fascinating. The universe disappears. The more light there is,\nthe less you can see. Time. Nobody can see time. I don't know if you know this. There's a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn't really exist, because it's too inconvenient\nfor the figures. It's much easier if it's not really there. You can't see the future, obviously, and you can't see the past,\nexcept in your memory. One of the interesting\nthings about the past is you particularly can't see -- my son asked me this the other day, \"Dad, can you remember\nwhat I was like when I was two? And I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Why can't I?\" Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember what happened to you\nearlier than the age of two or three. Which is great news for psychoanalysts,\nbecause otherwise they'd be out of a job. Because that's where all the stuff happens (Laughter) that makes you who you are. Another thing you can't see\nis the grid on which we hang. This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,\nthat cells are continually renewed. Skin flakes off, hairs grow,\nnails, that kind of stuff -- but every cell in your body\nis replaced at some point. Taste buds, every ten days or so. Livers and internal organs\ntake a bit longer. Spine takes several years. But at the end of seven years,\nnot one cell in your body remains from what was there\nseven years ago. The question is:\nwho then are we? What are we? What is this thing that we hang on? That is actually us? Atoms, can't see them. Nobody ever will. They're smaller\nthan the wavelength of light. Gas, can't see that. Interesting, somebody\nmentioned 1600 recently. Gas was invented in 1600\nby a Dutch chemist called van Helmont. It's said to be the most successful ever\ninvention of a word by a known individual. Quite good. He also invented a word\ncalled \"blas,\" meaning astral radiation. Didn't catch on, unfortunately. (Laughter) But well done, him. Light -- you can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum, if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,\nyou won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists\nwill disagree with this. But it's odd that you can't see\nthe beam of light, you can only see what it hits. Electricity, can't see that. Don't let anyone tell you\nthey understand electricity, they don't. Nobody knows what it is. (Laughter) You probably think the electrons\nin an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire, don't you,\nat the speed of light, when you turn the light on, they don't. Electrons bumble down the wire, about the speed of spreading\nhoney, they say. Galaxies -- hundred billion of them, estimated in the universe.\nHundred billion. How many can we see? Five. Five, out of a hundred billion\ngalaxies, with the naked eye. And one of them is quite difficult to see,\nunless you've got very good eyesight. Radio waves. There's another thing. Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered\nradio waves, in 1887, he called them radio waves\nbecause they radiated. Somebody said to him,\n\"What's the point of these, Heinrich? What's the point of these radio waves\nthat you've found?\" And he said, \"Well, I've no idea, but I guess somebody will find\na use for them someday. The biggest thing that's invisible\nto us is what we don't know. It is incredible how little we know. Thomas Edison once said, \"We don't know one percent\nof one millionth about anything.\" And I've come to the conclusion -- because you ask this other question:\n\"What's another thing we can't see?\" The point, most of us. What's the point? The point -- what I've got it down to is there are only two questions\nreally worth asking. \"Why are we here?\", and \"What should\nwe do about it while we are?\" To help you, I've got two things to leave\nyou with, from two great philosophers, perhaps two of the greatest philosopher\nthinkers of the 20th century. One a mathematician and engineer,\nand the other a poet. The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein, who said, \"I don't know why we are here, but I am pretty sure it's not\nin order to enjoy ourselves.\" (Laughter) He was a cheerful bastard, wasn't he? (Laughter) And secondly, and lastly,\nW.H. Auden, one of my favorite poets, who said, \"We are here\non Earth to help others. What the others\nare here for, I've no idea.\" (Laughter) (Applause) (Circus music) [Get your souvenir photo here!] [Continue your journey into the unknown!] (Circus music)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Lloyd says that we can only see the skin of things.

{"page": 72, "lesson": 13, "title": "Making sense of spelling - Gina Cooke", "category": "Linguistics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/making-sense-of-spelling-gina-cooke", "transcript": {"en": "You've probably seen\nan email or an internet post about how weird and random\nEnglish spelling seems to be. But what if I told you that it\nactually makes perfect sense? In fact, that's spelling's job: Making sense. Think of spelling a word as peeling back the layers of an onion. The first layer\nis a word's sense and meaning. Often there are multiple\nlayers of meaning. Another layer is the word's structure. Think of the center of the onion\nas a word's base element, its essential kernel of meaning. A free-base element, like O-N-E, or T-W-O, can stand on its own as a word, like one, or two. A bound base, like the R-U-P-T\nof \"erupt\" or \"rupture\" needs another element in order\nto surface in a word. Two or more bases give us compounds, like \"twofold\"\nor \"someone\" or \"bankrupt.\" Once we figure\nout a word's meaningful elements, We can peel back its history\nto shed a little more light on why it's spelled as it is. The word \"two,\" for example, needs its \"W\" in order\nto mark its connection to words like \"twice,\" \"twelve,\" \"twenty,\" \"twin\" and \"between.\" A word's history\nis another layer of the onion. With that understanding,\nlet's investigate the word \"one.\" First we need to check\nin with what it means. Unique, single, solitary. \"One's\" historical layers\ninclude its relatives \"only,\" \"once,\" \"eleven,\" and even \"a,\" \"an\" and \"any.\" But it's the morphological relatives - the ones that share the base O-N-E - That are really astonishing. There are the familiar\nones, like \"anyone,\" and \"one-track\" and \"oneself\"\n- those are obvious. But let's take a look\nat some unexpected derivations of the word \"one.\" The word \"alone\" is built from the prefix\nA-L plus the base O-N-E. It's the same A-L prefix that we see in \"always,\" \"already,\"\n\"almighty\" and \"almost.\" It means \"all.\" the word \"alone\" means \"all one.\" It was misanalysed in the middle ages as having the prefix \"a,\" like in \"asleep\"\nand \"awake\" and \"around,\" and a new base was born: L-O-N-E, which then developed into its own family. In the word \"atone,\" we find\nthe familiar preposition \"at\" compounded with the base O-N-E. See, when we atone for something\nwe've done wrong, we attempt to make things whole again, to fix what's broken, to be\nat one again with whomever we hurt. But here's perhaps the best one of all: the word \"onion,\" which is also\nfrequently derided as irregular or crazy, for its spelling\nof \"uh\" with an O. But again, if we look\ninto the word's structure, and its history, it's a mystery no more. When we look at the roots of an onion, we learn that it is written\nas O-N-E plus I-O-N, the same suffix we find\nin \"tension,\" \"action,\" \"union\" and thousands of other words in English. Unlike the many cloves\nin a head of garlic, an onion has a single bulb. It is marked by the state\nor condition of oneness. Like an onion, English is one - one single writing system\nshared across time and space. Its structure and its\nhistory have many layers, and peeling them apart can really\nadd flavor to our language and spice up our understanding.

{"page": 72, "lesson": 14, "title": "The art of the metaphor - Jane Hirshfield", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/jane-hirshfield-the-art-of-the-metaphor", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: tom carter\nReviewer: Bedirhan Cinar When we talk, sometimes\nwe say things directly. \"I'm going to the store,\nI'll be back in five minutes.\" Other times though, we talk in a way\nthat conjures up a small scene. \"It's raining cats and dogs out,\" we say, or \"I was waiting\nfor the other shoe to drop.\" Metaphors are a way\nto talk about one thing by describing something else. That may seem roundabout, but it's not. Seeing and hearing and tasting\nare how we know anything first. The philosopher William James\ndescribed the world of newborn infants as a \"buzzing and blooming confusion.\" Abstract ideas are pale things compared to those first bees and blossoms. Metaphors think\nwith the imagination and the senses. The hot chili peppers in them\nexplode in the mouth and the mind. They're also precise. We don't really stop\nto think about a raindrop the size of an actual cat or dog, but as soon as I do, I realize that I'm quite certain\nthe dog has to be a small one -- a cocker spaniel, or a dachshund -- and not a golden Lab or Newfoundland. I think a beagle might be about right. A metaphor isn't true or untrue\nin any ordinary sense. Metaphors are art, not science, but they can still feel right or wrong. A metaphor that isn't good\nleaves you confused. You know what it means\nto feel like a square wheel, but not what it's like\nto be tired as a whale. There's a paradox to metaphors. They almost always\nsay things that aren't true. If you say, \"there's\nan elephant in the room,\" there isn't an actual one, looking for the peanut dish on the table. Metaphors get under your skin\nby ghosting right past the logical mind. Plus, we're used to thinking in images. Every night we dream impossible things. And when we wake up,\nthat way of thinking's still in us. We take off our dream shoes, and button ourselves into our lives. Some metaphors\ninclude the words \"like\" or \"as.\" \"Sweet as honey,\" \"strong as a tree.\" Those are called similes. A simile is a metaphor\nthat admits it's making a comparison. Similes tend to make you think. Metaphors let you feel things directly. Take Shakespeare's famous metaphor, \"All the world's a stage.\" \"The world is like a stage\"\njust seems thinner, and more boring. Metaphors can also live in verbs. Emily Dickinson begins a poem, \"I saw no way --\nthe heavens were stitched --\" and we know instantly what it would feel like\nif the sky were a fabric sewn shut. They can live in adjectives, too. \"Still waters run deep,\"\nwe say of someone quiet and thoughtful. And the deep matters\nas much as the stillness and the water do. One of the clearest places\nto find good metaphors is in poems. Take this haiku by the 18th-century\nJapanese poet Issa. \"On a branch floating downriver,\na cricket singing.\" The first way to meet a metaphor\nis just to see the world through its eyes: an insect sings from a branch\npassing by in the middle of the river. Even as you see that though, some part of you recognizes in the image a small portrait of what it's like\nto live in this world of change and time, our human fate is to vanish,\nas surely as that small cricket will, and still, we do what it does. We live, we sing. Sometimes a poem\ntakes a metaphor and extends it, building on one idea in many ways. Here's the beginning\nof Langston Hughes' famous poem \"Mother to Son.\" \"Well, son, I'll tell you. Life for me ain't been no crystal stair. It's had tacks in it, and splinters, and boards torn up, and places with no carpet on the floor.\" Langston Hughes is making\na metaphor that compares a hard life to a wrecked house\nyou still have to live in. Those splinters and tacks feel real, they hurt your own feet\nand your own heart, but the mother\nis describing her life here, not her actual house. And hunger, and cold,\nexhausting work and poverty are what's also inside those splinters. Metaphors aren't always\nabout our human lives and feelings. The Chicago poet Carl Sandburg wrote, \"The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor\nand city on silent haunches, and then moves on.\" The comparison here is simple. Fog is being described as a cat. But a good metaphor isn't a puzzle, or a way to convey hidden meanings, it's a way to let you feel\nand know something differently. No one who's heard this poem forgets it. You see fog, and there's a small grey cat nearby. Metaphors give words a way\nto go beyond their own meaning. They're handles on the door\nof what we can know, and of what we can imagine. Each door leads to some new house, and some new world\nthat only that one handle can open. What's amazing is this: by making a handle, you can make a world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A metaphor is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A way of talking about one thing by describing it in terms of another"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A take-out sandwich with meat in it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A fact"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A way to confuse people"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Always about a strong human emotion"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A simile is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A way to let people know you're happy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A particular kind of metaphor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A phrase that compares two things using \"like\" or \"as\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "An elephant in the room"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both B and C"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "\"An elephant in the room\" is a way of saying", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Your house is a zoo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "You like to eat peanuts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "You might want to buy some moisturizer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "You and everyone else know something that no one is mentioning"}, {"label": "E", "text": "You need a bigger bedroom"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The mother in Langston Hughes' poem \"Mother to Son\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is a happy and carefree person"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Needs to hire a carpenter"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spends a lot of time washing her stairs to keep them crystal clean"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Has had a hard life"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Givers her son a lot of rules he has to follow"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "You might like using metaphors when you write and talk because", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It invites what you say into the reader’s senses, not just their minds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A good metaphor lets you think and feel in a different way"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It lets you say things that aren’t factually true yet still have meaning"}, {"label": "D", "text": "People can draw cool pictures of the things you say if they want to"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

However, the three-dimensional\nshapes of molecules were utterly unclear, since they couldn't\nbe observed directly. Molecules were represented using\nsimple connectivity graphs like the one you see here. It was clear to savvy chemists\nof the mid-19th century that these flat representations\ncouldn't explain many of their observations. But chemical theory hadn't provided\na satisfactory explanation for the three-dimensional\nstructures of molecules. In 1874, the chemist Van't Hoff\npublished a remarkable hypothesis: the four bonds of a saturated carbon atom point to the corners of a tetrahedron. It would take over 25 years for the quantum revolution\nto theoretically validate his hypothesis. But Van't Hoff supported\nhis theory using optical rotation. Van't Hoff noticed that only compounds\ncontaining a central carbon bound to four different atoms or groups rotated plane-polarized light. Clearly there's something unique\nabout this class of compounds. Take a look at the two molecules\nyou see here. Each one is characterized\nby a central, tetrahedral carbon atom bound to four different atoms: bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and hydrogen. We might be tempted to conclude\nthat the two molecules are the same, if we just concern\nourselves with what they're made of. However, let's see if we can\noverlay the two molecules perfectly to really prove\nthat they're the same. We have free license to rotate\nand translate both of the molecules as we wish. Remarkably though, no matter how we move the molecules, we find that perfect superposition\nis impossible to achieve. Now take a look at your hands. Notice that your two hands\nhave all the same parts: a thumb, fingers, a palm, etc. Like our two molecules under study, both of your hands are made\nof the same stuff. Furthermore, the distances between stuff\nin both of your hands are the same. The index finger\nis next to the middle finger, which is next to the ring finger, etc. The same is true\nof our hypothetical molecules. All of their internal distances are the same. Despite\nthe similarities between them, your hands, and our molecules, are certainly not the same. Try superimposing\nyour hands on one another. Just like our molecules from before, you'll find that it can't\nbe done perfectly. Now, point your palms toward one another. Wiggle both of your index fingers. Notice that your left hand\nlooks as if it's looking in a mirror at your right. In other words, your hands\nare mirror images. The same can be said of our molecules. We can turn them so\nthat one looks at the other as in a mirror. Your hands\n- and our molecules - possess a spatial property\nin common called chirality, or handedness. Chirality means exactly\nwhat we've just described: a chiral object is not\nthe same as its mirror image. Chiral objects are very special\nin both chemistry and everyday life. Screws, for example, are also chiral. That's why we need the terms\nright-handed and left-handed screws. And believe it or not,\ncertain types of light can behave like chiral screws. Packed into every linear,\nplane-polarized beam of light are right-handed and left-handed parts that rotate together\nto produce plane polarization. Chiral molecules, placed\nin a beam of such light, interact differently\nwith the two chiral components. As a result, one component of the light\ngets temporarily slowed down relative to the other. The\neffect on the light beam is a rotation of its plane\nfrom the original one, otherwise known as optical rotation. Van't Hoff and later chemists\nrealized that the chiral nature of tetrahedral carbons can explain\nthis fascinating phenomenon. Chirality is responsible for all kinds\nof other fascinating effects in chemistry, and everyday life. Humans tend to love symmetry and so if you look around you,\nyou'll find that chiral objects made by humans are rare. But chiral molecules\nare absolutely everywhere. Phenomena as separate as optical rotation, Screwing together furniture, and clapping your hands all involve this intriguing\nspatial property."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "To support his theory concerning the geometry of saturated carbon atoms, van’t Hoff used the phenomenon of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "asymmetric catalysis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "molecular volume"}, {"label": "C", "text": "optical rotation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "boiling-point elevation"}, {"label": "E", "text": "enantioselectivity"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "van’t Hoff postulated that chiral compounds contained at least one atom with what geometry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "linear"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bent"}, {"label": "C", "text": "trigonal planar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "tetrahedral"}, {"label": "E", "text": "t-shaped"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Chirality is a property that concerns the relationship between a molecule and its:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "shape"}, {"label": "B", "text": "mirror image"}, {"label": "C", "text": "internal distances"}, {"label": "D", "text": "electron density"}, {"label": "E", "text": "rotational isomers"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The chiral components of a linearly polarized beam of light can be compared to everyday objects.

Or wondered what causes your bicycle to move? Or thought about why it goes forward \ninstead of backwards or sideways? Perhaps not, and you wouldn't be alone. It wasn't until the 17th century that Isaac Newton described \nthe fundamental laws of motion and we understood the answer \nto these three questions. What Newton recognized was that \nthings tend to keep on doing what they are already doing. \nSo when your bicycle is stopped, it stays stopped, and when it is going, it stays going. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion and objects at rest tend to stay at rest. That's Newton's First Law. Physicists call it the Law of Inertia, \nwhich is a fancy way of saying that moving objects don't spontaneously \nspeed up, slow down, or change direction. It is this inertia that you must overcome \nto get your bicycle moving. Now you know that you have to overcome \ninertia to get your bicycle moving, but what is it that allows you to overcome it? Well, the answer is explained by Newton's Second Law. In mathematical terms, Newton's Second Law says that force is the product of mass times acceleration. To cause an object to accelerate, or speed up, a force must be applied. The more force you apply, the quicker you accelerate. \nAnd the more mass your bicycle has, and the more mass you have too, the more force you have to use \nto accelerate at the same rate. This is why it would be really difficult \nto pedal a 10,000 pound bicycle. And it is this force, which is applied \nby your legs pushing down on the pedals, that allows you to overcome Newton's Law of Inertia. The harder you push down on the pedals, \nthe bigger the force and the quicker you accelerate. Now on to the final question: When you do get your bike moving, why does it go forward? According to Newton's Third Law, \nfor every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. To understand this, think about what \nhappens when you drop a bouncy ball. As the bouncy ball hits the floor, it causes a downward force on the floor. This is the action. The floor reacts by pushing \non the ball with the same force, but in the opposite direction, upward, causing it to bounce back up to you. Together, the floor and the ball form what's called the action/reaction pair. \nWhen it comes to your bicycle, it is a little more complicated. \nAs your bicycle wheels spin clockwise, the parts of each tire \ntouching the ground push backwards against the Earth: the actions. The ground pushes \nforward with the same force against each of your tires: the reactions. Since you have two bicycle tires, \neach one forms an action/reaction pair with the ground. And since \nthe Earth is really, really, really big compared to your bicycle, it barely moves from the force caused by your bicycle \ntires pushing backwards, but you are propelled forward."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Newton’s First Law is also known as the law of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Inertia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Motion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Physics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mass"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Particles"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Force is the product of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mass and charge"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Matter and energy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Particles and waves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mass and acceleration"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Speed and weight"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to Newton’s Third Law, for every action there is an equal and opposite", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Force"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reaction"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Push"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Retaliation"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Energization"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If an object is at rest, what must be applied to get it moving?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Force"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Acceleration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Speed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mass"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Energy"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "According to the video, why would it be really difficult to pedal a 10,000 pound bicycle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To accelerate a large mass requires a large force"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Large masses tend to spontaneously stop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The reaction of the bicycle to force is unfavorable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lighter objects require larger forces to accelerate quicker"}, {"label": "E", "text": "It would not be difficult"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

I'm talking about shape memory alloys. Like the name says, these are metals that remember different shapes. To understand how these metals work, we've got to talk about atoms and organizing. Let's talk about atoms first. Atoms are tiny bits of matter\nthat you cannot see with your eye yet they make up everything in our world, from the chair that you're sitting on\nto your cell phone. Atoms have some surprising ways of behaving too. We'll talk about that shortly. Now, how big is an atom? Well, imagine pulling one of your hairs\nout of your head and whittling it like a stick 100,000 times. One of those shavings \nwould be the width of an atom. They're that small. Now let's talk about atoms and organizing. You may not know this,\nbut atoms arrange themselves similar to the way we humans arrange ourselves. Sometimes they sit in rows, like we do on a bus or an airplane. We call that seating arrangement a phase. Other times they sit diagonal from each other, sort of like seats in a movie theater or sports stadium. This is another phase. When atoms move from one seating to another this is called a phase change. Phase changes are all around us. You may already know about water's phases: solid, liquid and gas. Many other materials have phases like that too. Some of them have several solid phases. OK. Back to those shape memory alloys\nwe mentioned before. When we say that the metals \nremember their different shapes, what we're really saying is they\nremember different seating arrangements of atoms. When the atoms rearrange, the metal moves from one shape to another. Let's look at a phase change in action. Here I have a metal wire that \nis made out of nickel and titanium. This metal wire is a shape memory alloy, and I'm going to make it switch\nbetween its different shapes using heat from a lighter. Watch this. I'm going to wrap this wire around my finger and then heat it. Amazing! That wire returns to a straight line,\nwhen I heat it. Let's try that again. I'm going to wrap it around my finger,\nand heat it. Yep, that's still amazing. Not only is it amazing, this is weird, because metals generally don't do that. Here's a paper clip. When I heat it, I get nothing. What we're seeing is the shape memory wire\nchanging phases when it gets hot. When the wire is cold, atoms \nare in a diagonal arrangement, like the movie theater seating,\nwe talked about before. We call this a monoclinic arrangement, and scientists will call this phase martensite. When I heated up the wire, the atoms moved into columns like airplane seating. This is a cubic arrangement. Scientists will call this phase austenite. So when we added the heat, \nthe atoms shifted positions seamlessly, and they'll do this forever. They have this coordinated motion, \njust like members of a tireless marching band. Each makes a small shift, but all \ntogether those small shifts create a totally different pattern. So that's pretty cool, but\nwhere do we use these materials? Well, if you look in the sky tonight, shape memory alloys are at work - on Mars. They're used to move \npanels on the Mars rover, so that it can study the environment. Like our metal straightened when it was heated, the metals holding the panels\nwill move when electrically heated. When we stop heating the shape memory metal, the panel will return back,\ndue to an opposing spring. Back on Earth, shape memory alloys\nare used to open up clogged arteries as stents, which are small collapsible springs that force open passages. Shape memory alloys are also used to move robots, toy butterflies, teeth in braces,\nand for a perfect fit every time, shape memory wires are used \nas underwires in bras. Now you know Victoria's secret. By popping a bra into the dryer, \nit'll be brand new every time. So whether it's on Mars or in your mouth,\nsmall atomic movements can create huge changes, and understanding the way atoms behave allows us to make materials \nthat make our world a better place."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How big is an atom?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As thick as your hair"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1/100,000 the thickness of your hair"}, {"label": "C", "text": "As big as a piece of dust"}, {"label": "D", "text": "As big as an amoeba"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How do the different phases in shape memory alloys differ?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The atoms are arranged differently at different temperatures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They have different compositions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Each have a different number of protons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are not different"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The shape memory wire changes shape mostly by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A thermal expansion of the wire"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A phase change"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A pressure buildup due to heat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An increased porosity with heating"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the medical devices are NOT used with shape memory alloys?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Orthodontic wire"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stents"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scalpels"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "At cold temperatures, atoms in the shape memory wire are arranged in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Offset seating like in a theater (martensite)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Straight rows like on an airplane (austenite)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Randomly arranged (amorphous)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In a hexagonal shape"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 72, "lesson": 18, "title": "How to think about gravity - Jon Bergmann", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/jon-bergmann-how-to-think-about-gravity", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: Ido Dekkers\nReviewer: Ariana Bleau Lugo So what is gravity? I bet most of you think it's: \"What goes up, must come down!\" Is that right? Well, sorta, but not really. Technically, the law of gravity is an equation. It is: F = G x M1 x M2 / R^2, where G is the universal gravitational constant, M1 and M2 are the masses of the two objects, and R is the distance between them squared. That was easy, right? Probably not. What does this actually mean? Well it means that - well, everything is attracted to everything else. What I mean by that is if you have two objects, any two objects, they are attracted to each other. OK. Let's try and wrap our minds around this. What happens when you drop a rock off a cliff? It falls to the earth. Right? Well, yes, but something else happens. You see, the law of gravity says that both objects, the rock and the earth, are attracted to each other. This means that the rock falls towards the earth, and the earth falls towards the rock. Wait a second - you mean to tell me that if - the earth falls up to meet the rock? Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. And the reason you don't see the earth fall up to meet the rock is because the objects move towards each other proportionate to their respective masses. The earth is much much much more massive than the rock, so it moves a very very small distance, and the rock is much less massive, so it moves farther with respect to the earth. Maybe a better way to understand gravity is to take two teenagers in spacesuits, and place them far out in space - away from all the planets and the stars. It turns out they will be attracted to each other. I'm not talking about that kind of attraction. See, they have mass, and since they have mass, they will move towards each other. They are attracted to each other. Maybe one more thing might help. Have you ever played with two magnets? You know, the magnets with the north and the south poles? When you take the magnets and put them closer to each other, they move together. They are attracted to each other. And the closer they are, the stronger the attraction. Think of the mass of the object like the strength of a magnet and the distance between the objects like the distance between the two magnets. Now understand, I'm not saying that gravity and magnetism are the same, they just behave in a similar way. Let's think of one other thing - astronauts. You know, astronauts, they weigh less on the moon than on the earth. Why is that? Well you see, the moon is less massive than the earth. Therefore it has a smaller gravitational pull on the astronaut. It's like the moon is a weaker magnet. They aren't as attracted to each other. Distance also plays a role. Think back to playing with a magnet. The pull of the magnets towards each other are stronger when they are closer together. The same is true of gravity. For example, the sun is the most massive object near the earth. It dictates most of the gravitational forces in our solar system. It is very very massive. But it is relatively far away, so even though the sun is a much stronger magnet, so to speak, it is a long ways away. Therefore the attraction isn't as strong. So let's look back at that law of gravity. The equation: F = G x M1 x M2 / R ^2. You see the force of gravity is equal to a number. That's that universal gravitational constant G times the mass of object one, times the mass of object two. Think of M1 being the mass of the sun and M2 being the mass of the earth. And then we divide by the distance between them squared. This determines the force of attraction between the sun and earth. You could just as easily plug in your mass and the earth's mass and the distance between you and the center of the earth, and find out how much you are attracted to the earth, and the earth attracted to you. So, what's gravity? Everything is attracted to everything else. Everything. Oh, one last thing, just to make you wonder. What causes gravity? Why are two objects with mass attracted to each other? Well, the answer is - We don't know. The cause of gravity remains a mystery to scientists. We don't really know conclusively what causes gravity. It is one of the great mysteries of science."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When you drop a rock from a cliff, which of the following happens?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only the rock falls to the Earth."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Only the Earth falls up to meet the rock."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The rock and the Earth fall towards each other."}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If you place two teenagers with equal mass in space ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They will fall towards each other"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They will remain in place"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They will move apart"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We cannot even make an educated guess about what will happen"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is gravity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "What goes up must come down."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Everything is attracted to everything else."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only small things are attracted to larger things."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only larger things are attracted to smaller things."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why do astronauts weigh less on the moon than they do on the earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It's a little known fact, but space suits generally make people weigh less."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The moon has less mass than the Earth.

That shape was chosen \nto be a slight rectangle, but still mostly square, thus having \nthe maximal screen area for the given dimensions. And that's still the ratio on many TVs \nand computer monitors in today's homes. The problem is, hardly anybody today \ntreats video content in a 4 to 3 ratio. See, this whole problem started when people wanted \nto watch movies from the theater in the comfort of their own homes. Movie screens are considerably larger \nthan our home television. More important, the screen \nis completely different rectangle and can't mathematically fit \non our TV screens without manipulation. A typical TV is one and a third times\nwider than it is tall Some movie screens could be up to \nthree times as wide as it is tall. So what're we going to do to make it fit? \nWell, we have all kinds of options. Well, we could squeeze and stretch \nand mangle everything onto the screen, to make it all fill up, and everyone would look\nridiculously thin and compressed. The good news is\nthe sound would be just fine, although I don't think people would be \ntoo happy about that option, particularly the actors in the movie. We could just cut a chunk \nof the original movie like a cookie cutter and just see that frame of the movie. The problem with that would be \npeople and objects would be speaking from off the screen,\nor, even worse, they might be cut in half. Some movie editors use what's called\nthe \"pan and scan\" technique to allow the full height \nof the TV screen to be used, but pick and choose what section \nof the original movie should be shown on your screen thus eliminating the annoying \ncutting of people. Imagine that job: staring at a 4 to 3 hole watching movies all day, \ndeciding for everyone which piece of the screen is\nthe most important part for people to see. Now let's do a little quick math. If we compare a major cinematic film \nproduced on a 2.35 to 1 aspect frame with my standard 4 to 3 TV screen, we find out that only 55% of the movie \ncan actually fit on the screen at any one time. Just over half! You've seen the disclaimer \nat the beginning of the movie on TV or DVD that says, \n\"This film has been modified from its original format \nto fit on your TV screen.\" Well, what it should say is, \"We are only displaying 55% \nof the movie of our choosing.\" Now for all the full-screen TV lovers, this is your dilemma: do you want to see all the movie, \nor is 55% good enough? How about new TVs? Around the start of the century, \nsome widescreen TVs emerged in a 16 to 9, or 1.78 times \nwider than it is tall. Well, this screen fits \nthe movie a little better, but still only shows 75% \nof the original movie at one time. Suppose someone made \na TV for your living room that was actually 2.35 to 1 \nto show those full movies? Well, the TV with the same height \nas the most current 50-inch TVs - that TV would be close to six feet long. And on top of that, you'd only use \nthe full screen when you watched movies. Most of the other content \nwould have to be stretched, or have empty space on \nthe sides of the screen. Of course, there is one more option. We can just shrink\nthe movie screen proportionally, to fit the width of your home television. We can mathematically scale the original \nto fit exactly the width of the screen and this'll preserve \nthe entire movie screen, but show the infamous black bars\nalong the top and bottom that so many television watchers abhor. Of course, now you can argue \nthat we're only using 75% of that screen. And that is where the real question is: do you want your full screen, \nor do you want to see the entire movie?

Some numbers, such as the speed of sound, are small and easy to work with. Other numbers, such as the speed of light, are much larger\nand cumbersome to work with. We can use scientific notation\nto express these large numbers in a much more manageable format. So we can write\n299,792,458 meters per second as 3.0 times 10 to the eighth\nmeters per second. Correct scientific notation requires that the first term\nrange in value so that it is greater than one\nbut less than 10, and the second term represents\nthe power of 10 or order of magnitude by which we multiply the first term. We can use the power of 10 as a tool\nin making quick estimations when we do not need or care\nfor the exact value of a number. For example, the diameter of an atom is approximately 10 to the power\nof negative 12 meters. The height of a tree is approximately\n10 to the power of one meter. The diameter of the Earth is approximately\n10 to the power of seven meters. The ability to use the power of 10\nas an estimation tool can come in handy every now and again, like when you're trying to guess\nthe number of M&M's in a jar, but is also an essential skill\nin math and science, especially when dealing with\nwhat are known as Fermi problems. Fermi problems are named\nafter the physicist Enrico Fermi, who's famous for making rapid\norder-of-magnitude estimations, or rapid estimations,\nwith seemingly little available data. Fermi worked on the Manhattan Project\nin developing the atomic bomb, and when it was tested\nat the Trinity site in 1945, Fermi dropped a few pieces\nof paper during the blast and used the distance they traveled\nbackwards as they fell to estimate the strength of the explosion\nas 10 kilotons of TNT, which is on the same order of magnitude\nas the actual value of 20 kilotons. One example of the classic\nFermi estimation problems is to determine\nhow many piano tuners there are in the city of Chicago, Illinois. At first, there seem to be\nso many unknowns that the problem appears to be unsolvable. That is the perfect application\nfor a power-of-10 estimation, as we don't need an exact answer - an estimation will work. We can start by determining how many\npeople live in the city of Chicago. We know that it is a large city, but we may be unsure about exactly\nhow many people live in the city. Are the one million people?\nFive million people? This is the point in the problem where many people become frustrated\nwith the uncertainty, but we can easily get through this\nby using the power of 10. We can estimate the magnitude\nof the population of Chicago as 10 to the power of six. While this doesn't tell us exactly\nhow many people live there, it serves an accurate estimation\nfor the actual population of just under three million people. So if there are approximately\n10 to the sixth people in Chicago, how many pianos are there? If we want to continue\ndealing with orders of magnitude, we can either say that one out of 10 or one out of one hundred\npeople own a piano. Given that our estimate of the population\nincludes children and adults, we'll go with the latter estimate, which estimates that there are\napproximately 10 to the fourth, or 10,000 pianos, in Chicago. With this many pianos,\nhow many piano tuners are there? We could begin the process of thinking\nabout how often the pianos are tuned, how many pianos are tuned in one day, or how many days a piano tuner works, but that's not the point\nof rapid estimation. We instead think in orders of magnitude, and say that a piano tuner tunes roughly\n10 to the second pianos in a given year, which is approximately\na few hundred pianos. Given our previous estimate\nof 10 to the fourth pianos in Chicago, and the estimate that each piano tuner can\ntune 10 to the second pianos each year, we can say that there are approximately\n10 to the second piano tuners in Chicago. Now, I know what you must be thinking: How can all of these estimates\nproduce a reasonable answer? Well, it's rather simple. In any Fermi problem, it is assumed that the overestimates and underestimates\nbalance each other out, and produce an estimation that is usually within one order\nof magnitude of the actual answer. In our case we can confirm this\nby looking in the phone book for the number of piano tuners\nlisted in Chicago. What do we find? 81. Pretty incredible, given\nour order-of-magnitude estimation.

(Not the animal, the other one.) - Daniel Dulek", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/daniel-dulek-how-big-is-a-mole-not-the-animal-the-other-one", "transcript": {"en": "OK, today we're going\nto talk about the mole. Now, I know what you're thinking:\n\"I know what a mole is, it's a small furry creature that digs holes\nin the ground and destroys gardens.\" And some of you might be thinking that it's a growth\non your aunt's face with hairs sticking out of it. Well, in this case, a mole is a concept\nthat we use in chemistry to count molecules, atoms, just about anything\nextremely small. Have you ever wondered how many atoms\nthere are in the universe? Or in your body? Or\neven in a grain of sand? Scientists have wanted\nto answer that question, but how do you count something\nas small as an atom? Well, in 1811, someone had an idea\nthat if you had equal volumes of gases, at the same\ntemperature and pressure, they would contain an equal\nnumber of particles. His name was Lorenzo Romano\nAmedeo Carlo Avogadro. I wonder how long it took\nhim to sign autographs. Unfortunately for Avogadro, most scientists\ndidn't accept the idea of the atom, and there was no way\nto prove he was right. There was no clear difference\nbetween atoms and molecules. Most scientists looked at Avogadro's work\nas purely hypothetical, and didn't give it much thought. But it turned out he was right!\nBy late 1860, Avogadro was proven correct,\nand his work helped lay the foundation for the atomic theory. Unfortunately,\nAvogadro died in 1856. Now the thing is that the amount\nof particles in even small samples is tremendous. For example, If you have a balloon of any gas\nat zero degrees Celcius, and at a pressure of one atmosphere,\nthen you have precisely six hundred and two sextillion\ngas particles. That is, you have six with 23 zeros\nafter it particles of gas in the container. Or in scientific notation, 6.02\ntimes 10 to the 23rd particles. This example is a little misleading, because gases take up a lot of space\ndue to the high kinetic energy of the gas particles, and it leaves you\nthinking atoms are bigger than they really are. Instead, think of water molecules. If you pour 18.01 grams\nof water into a glass, which is 18.01 milliliters,\nwhich is like three and a half teaspoons of water, you'll have 602 sextillion\nmolecules of water. Since Lorenzo Romano - uh, never mind - Avogadro\nwas the first one to come up with this idea, scientists named the number 6.02\ntimes 10 to the 23rd after him. It is simply known as Avogadros's number. Now, back to the mole. Not that mole. This mole. Yep, this\nnumber has a second name. The mole. Chemists use the term mole to refer to the quantities\nthat are at the magnitude of 602 sextillion. This is known as a molar quantity. Atoms and molecules are so small, that chemists\nhave bundled them into groups called moles. Moles are hard for students to understand\nbecause they have a hard time picturing the size of a mole, or of 602 sextillion. It's just too big to wrap\nour brains around. Remember our 18.01 milliliters of water? Well, that's a mole of water. But how much is that? Exactly what does 602\nsextillion look like? Maybe this'll help. Exchange the water particles for donuts. If you had a mole of donuts,\nthey would cover the entire earth to a depth of eight kilometers, which is about five miles. You really need a lot of coffee for that. If you had a mole of basketballs,\nyou could create a new planet the size of the earth. If you received a mole of pennies on the day\nyou were born and spent a million dollars a second until the day you died at the age\nof 100, you would still have more than 99.99% of your money in the bank. OK. Now we sort of have an idea\nhow large the mole is. So how do we use it? You might be surprised to know\nthat chemists use it the same way you use pounds to buy\ngrapes, deli meat, or eggs. When you go to the grocery store,\nyou don't go to the deli counter and ask for 43 slices of salami,\nyou buy your salami by the pound. When you buy your eggs,\nyou buy a dozen eggs. When we hear the word dozen,\nwe probably think of the number 12. We also know that a pair is two, a baker's dozen is 13, a gross is 144, and a ream\nof paper is - anybody? A ream is 500. Well, a mole is really the same thing. For a chemist, a mole conjures\nup the number 6.02 times 10 to the 23rd, not a fuzzy little animal.\nThe only difference is that the other quantities\nare more familiar to us. So there you have it -\nthe story of the mole, Avogadro, basketballs, and how to buy\nsalami at the grocery store."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In what field of science do we most often use the mole?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "chemistry"}, {"label": "B", "text": "botany"}, {"label": "C", "text": "zoology"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We don't use the mole in science."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What did Lorenzo Romano Amedeo Carlo Avogadro theorize in 1811?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Equal amounts of liquids at different temperatures and pressures will contain an equal amount of particles."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Equal amounts of gases at the same temperature and pressure will contain an equal amount of particles."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Equal amounts of gases at the same temperature and pressure will contain a vastly different amount of particles."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Scientists didn't know how to theorize in 1811."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If you have a balloon filled with one mole of gas at zero degrees Celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere, how many gas particles do you have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "660 billion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A google"}, {"label": "C", "text": "602 sextillion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Scientists don't know the answer"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What's another name for the mole?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Chemist's Constant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sextillion Power"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Power Point"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Avogadro's Number"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How big would a mole of basketballs be?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The size of the Empire State Building"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The size of China"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The size of the moon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The size of the earth"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 72, "lesson": 22, "title": "An introduction to mathematical theorems - Scott Kennedy", "category": "Numbers & Operations", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/scott-kennedy-how-to-prove-a-mathematical-theory", "transcript": {"en": "What is proof? And why is it so important in mathematics? Proofs provide a solid\nfoundation for mathematicians logicians, statisticians,\neconomists, architects, engineers, and many others to build\nand test their theories on. And they're just plain awesome! Let me start at the beginning. I'll introduce you\nto a fellow named Euclid. As in, \"here's looking at you, Clid.\" He lived in Greece about 2,300 years ago, and he's considered by many to be\nthe father of geometry. So if you've been wondering where\nto send your geometry fan mail, Euclid of Alexandria is the guy\nto thank for proofs. Euclid is not really known for inventing\nor discovering a lot of mathematics but he revolutionized the way\nin which it is written, presented, and thought about. Euclid set out to formalize mathematics\nby establishing the rules of the game. These rules of the game are called axioms. Once you have the rules, Euclid says you have to use them\nto prove what you think is true. If you can't, then your theorem or idea might be false. And if your theorem is false, then\nany theorems that come after it and use it might be false too. Like how one misplaced beam can\nbring down the whole house. So that's all that proofs are: using well-established rules to prove\nbeyond a doubt that some theorem is true. Then you use those theorems like blocks to build mathematics. Let's check out an example. Say I want to prove\nthat these two triangles are the same size and shape. In other words, they are congruent. Well, one way to do\nthat is to write a proof that shows that all three sides\nof one triangle are congruent to all three sides\nof the other triangle. So how do we prove it? First, I'll write down what we know. We know that point M\nis the midpoint of AB. We also know that sides AC\nand BC are already congruent. Now let's see. What does\nthe midpoint tell us? Luckily, I know\nthe definition of midpoint. It is basically the point in the middle. What this means is that AM\nand BM are the same length, since M is the exact middle of AB. In other words, the bottom side\nof each of our triangles are congruent. I'll put that as step two. Great! So far I have two pairs\nof sides that are congruent. The last one is easy. The third side of the left triangle is CM, and the third side\nof the right triangle is - well, also CM. They share the same side. Of course it's congruent to itself! This is called the reflexive property. Everything is congruent to itself. I'll put this as step three. Ta dah! You've just proven\nthat all three sides of the left triangle are congruent to all three sides\nof the right triangle. Plus, the two triangles are congruent because of the side-side-side\ncongruence theorem for triangles. When finished with a proof,\nI like to do what Euclid did. He marked the end of a proof\nwith the letters QED. It's Latin for \"quod erat demonstrandum,\" which translates literally to \"what was to be proven.\" But I just think of it\nas \"look what I just did!\" I can hear what you're thinking: why should I study proofs? One reason is that they could\nallow you to win any argument. Abraham Lincoln, one of our nation's greatest\nleaders of all time used to keep a copy of Euclid's Elements\non his bedside table to keep his mind in shape. Another reason is you can\nmake a million dollars. You heard me. One million dollars. That's the price that the Clay\nMathematics Institute in Massachusetts is willing to pay anyone who proves\none of the many unproven theories that it calls \"the millenium problems.\" A couple of these have been solved\nin the 90s and 2000s. But beyond money and arguments, proofs are everywhere. They underly architecture, art, computer\nprogramming, and internet security. If no one understood\nor could generate a proof, we could not advance these\nessential parts of our world. Finally, we all know\nthat the proof is in the pudding. And pudding is delicious.

Those moments in which you\nbegin to wonder and question. These moments have happened\nthroughout history. and have led to some truly\namazing discoveries. Take this story, for example. There once was a fellow named Archimedes. He was born in 287 B.C. in the city\nof Syracuse in Sicily. He was a Greek mathematician,\nphysicist, engineer, inventor, and astronomer. One day, Archimedes was summoned\nby the king of Sicily to investigate if he had\nbeen cheated by a goldsmith. The king said he had given a goldsmith\nthe exact amount of gold needed to make a crown. However, when the crown was ready, the king\nsuspected that the goldsmith cheated and slipped some silver into the crown, keeping some of the gold for himself. The king asked Archimedes\nto solve the problem. But there was a catch: he couldn't\ndo any damage to the crown. One day, while taking his bath, Archimedes noticed that the water\nlevel in the bathtub rose and overflowed as he immersed\nhimself into the tub. He suddenly realized that how much\nwater was displaced depended on how much\nof his body was immersed. This discovery excited him so much\nthat he jumped out of the tub and ran through the streets\nnaked, shouting \"Eureka!\" Which comes from the ancient\nGreek meaning \"I found it.\" What did he find? Well, he found a way\nto solve the king's problem. You see, Archimedes needed\nto check the crown's density to see if it was the same\nas the density of pure gold. Density is a measure of an object's mass\ndivided by its volume. Pure gold is very dense,\nwhile silver is less dense. So if there was silver in the crown, it would be\nless dense than if it were made of pure gold. But no matter what it was made of,\nthe crown would be the same shape, which means the same volume. So if Archimedes could measure\nthe mass of the crown first, and then measure its volume, he could find out how dense it was. But it is not easy to measure\na crown's volume - it has an irregular shape, that's different\nfrom a simple box or ball. You can't measure its size and multiply\nlike you might for other shapes. The solution, Archimedes realized, was to give the crown a bath. by placing it in water and seeing\nhow much water was displaced, he could measure the volume, and he'd calculate\nthe density of the crown. If the crown was less\ndense than pure gold, then the goldsmith most definitely\ncheated the king. When Archimedes went back\nto the king and did his test, the story says, he found that the goldsmith\nhad indeed cheated the king, and slipped some silver in. These days, using the way an object displaces\nwater to measure volume is called Archimedes' principle. The\nnext time you take a bath, you can see Archimedes'\nprinciple in action, and maybe you'll have\na genius idea of your own."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Salata says that some of the best opportunities to learn are the moments in which we are...", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "...most self aware."}, {"label": "B", "text": "...prepared."}, {"label": "C", "text": "...perplexed."}, {"label": "D", "text": "...overly excited."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When and where was Archimedes born?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "900 AD; Rome"}, {"label": "B", "text": "287 BC; Syracuse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2,000 BC; Manhattan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "287 AD; Florence"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What determined how much water was displaced from Archimedes bathtub?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How much of his body was immersed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "How hot the water was"}, {"label": "C", "text": "How long he stayed in the tub"}, {"label": "D", "text": "What type of soap he used"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What property did Archimedes need to determine in order to solve the king's mystery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The width of the king's head"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The weight of silver"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The density of the crown"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The cost of the crown"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "These days, using the way an object displaces water to determine volume is called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Bathtub Principle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Archimedes' Prinicple"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Principal's Office"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Water Displacement Principle"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Food, flags, and festivals, which are often talked about in schools, are the visible parts that we rightly celebrate. However, only when we look deeper, under the water, are we able to focus on the common values that connect us. In what seems to be an increasingly troubled world, where social and political systems are being stretched, conflict within and between countries is at times heightened, while human rights are being ignored, this desire for peace grows ever stronger. Sometimes we see this common value emerging above the surface and becoming visible. For example, it is part of everyday language used when people greet one another and welcome the new day. In many parts of the Arab world and parts of south Asia, such as Bangladesh for example, the greeting of \"as-salamu alaykum\" can be translated to \"peace be with you.\" The same is true as you walk through markets or into schools each morning in India, or Nepal, or Bhutan, where greetings of \"namaste,\" which has not only a strong message of peace - \"the spirit in me greets the spirit in you\" - but also its physical gesture, the palms brought together slowly at the heart, to honor a special place in each of us.
