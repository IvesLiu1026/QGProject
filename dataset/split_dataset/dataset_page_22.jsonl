A rogue sheep has slipped past her \nservants and guards and bolted into her yurt, where he springs into bed \nand bleats in her ear. Although she’s the formidable khatun \nof the Golden Horde, a huge kingdom in the Mongolian Empire, Boraqchin has a hands-on \napproach to ruling. She’s been married to Batu Khan, the fearsome grandson \nof Genghis Khan himself, since she was fifteen – and while her husband is out on his raids, she juggles the duties of flocks, \nfamily and empire at home. This makes her the manager – \nand the mover – of a city of thousands. Twice a year, Boraqchin moves the city \nbetween two seasonal camping grounds. This ensures constant water \nand lush grass in summer, and protection from harsh winds in winter. The whole operation requires \nweeks of strict planning, liaising with the other camps in her \ndomain, strategic delegation – and the patience to move at the speed \nof dawdling animals. Today is moving day, and she’ll have to direct throngs of her\nladies, commanders, slaves and animals up the river Volga for the summer. As Boraqchin steps outside, she’s greeted by a commotion – her unwanted visitor is now running \ncircles around her stewards. They’re attempting to stow her possessions\nsecurely into wagons. Boraqchin orders them \nto get it under control – but she’s the only one quick \nenough to catch the stray. She next supervises her ladies who are\nunpinning her yurt and lifting it onto its custom wagon. It requires a team of twenty oxen to pull, and Boraqchin wouldn’t trust anyone \nto steer it but herself. Next, Boraqchin and her woolly companion \nmeet with the guards. She orders them to keep close watch\non her husband's special reception yurt and port-able throne during the journey. They’ll also act as outriders, and she tells them how to secure the \nroute, surround her for safety – and keep the animals in check. But when the sheep finally breaks free \nand makes for the fields, the guards can barely keep up as it scampers through crowds \npacking up their yurts. Exasperated, Boraqchin rides down \nto the pastures herself. When she gets there, she catches sight of the troublesome sheep\nwriggling into the middle of a flock. When she follows him in, he’s nestled next to a ewe, his mother. She’s pregnant,\nand seems to be in pain. With a start, Boraqchin realizes \nthat this ewe’s impending delivery has been forgotten in \nthe flurry of moving day. There’s no time to find a shepherd – instead, Boraqchin rolls up her sleeves, \ngreases her arm and helps the ewe give birth to two new \nadditions to the empire. Leaving the lambs and their mother, Boraqchin dashes back to the camp. Here the final touches have \nbeen put to packing, and vehicles are starting to line up. This vast procession starts with the queen and two hundred wagons \nfilled with her treasures. Next up are the junior wives and crew, then the concubines – and this is only Boraqchin's camp. After this comes the second imperial camp led by another senior wife, then two more camps, also led by wives. Boraqchin has been checking in \nwith them for weeks to ensure a smooth departure and orderly queue. But they only make up the \nroyal portion of the line – behind them winds \nthe entire civilian city, which includes holy men \nwith portable chapels and mosques, families, tradesmen, and shepherds. Finally, Boraqchin settles into her wagon. It’ll take weeks to reach \ntheir destination – but over the course of the journey, she’ll keep everyone expertly in check – from her proud children \nand attentive subjects, to the most meandering sheep \nat the back of line."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Of which Khanate in the Mongol Empire is Boraqchin the queen?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Chaghatayid Khanate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Great Khanate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Ilkhanate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Golden Horde"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which river guides Boraqchin’s migration?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Don"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Dnieper"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Volga"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Danube"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many oxen does Boraqchin need to pull her special wagon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30"}, {"label": "D", "text": "40"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the problem with the ewe?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She is afraid of the runaway sheep"}, {"label": "B", "text": "She is injured"}, {"label": "C", "text": "She is pregnant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "She is giving birth"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who goes on this migration in addition to Boraqchin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The other wives"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Holy men"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Merchants"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Guards"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}, {"label": "F", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

{"page": 22, "lesson": 3, "title": "The truth about electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) - Helen M. Farrell", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-truth-about-electroconvulsive-therapy-ect-helen-m-farrell", "transcript": {"en": "In 1982, a young nurse was suffering\nfrom severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough\nto read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive\ntherapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate\nschool, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about\nher life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an\nextremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little\nresemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first\nused in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a\nstrong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure\nduring which patients might bite their tongues\nor even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under \ngeneral anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series\nof mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons\nto fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms\nfrom spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the\nelectricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute,\nand most patients are able to resume normal activities about an\nhour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases\nof major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded\nto other therapies, or who have had adverse \nreactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo \ntreatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or\nthree sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement\nin their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent\ntreatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance\nsessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than\nit used to be, but patients can still \nexperience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, \nor nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what\nhappened right before a session— for example, what they had for \ndinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble \nremembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory\nloss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its \nproven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via\nelectrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry, \ncontributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked\nby ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release\nof certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between\nneurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones\nthat may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works\nbetter when paired with medication, even in patients who were\nresistant to medication before. As we come to a better \nunderstanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make \nECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after\nher first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an\naccount of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding\nthe treatment, she worried that doing so\nmight negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference\nfor patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make\ndoctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s \nlife changing potential."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "ECT, once largely stigmatized, has become a mainstream treatment again for depression and mania.

{"page": 22, "lesson": 4, "title": "What happens in your brain when you pay attention? - Mehdi Ordikhani-Seyedlar", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/ljH6Ni28", "transcript": {"en": "Paying close attention to something: Not that easy, is it? It's because our attention is pulled\nin so many different directions at a time, and it's in fact pretty impressive\nif you can stay focused. Many people think that attention\nis all about what we are focusing on, but it's also about what information\nour brain is trying to filter out. There are two ways\nyou direct your attention. First, there's overt attention. In overt attention,\nyou move your eyes towards something in order to pay attention to it. Then there's covert attention. In covert attention,\nyou pay attention to something, but without moving your eyes. Think of driving for a second. Your overt attention,\nyour direction of the eyes, are in front, but that's your covert attention which is constantly scanning\nthe surrounding area, where you don't actually look at them. I'm a computational neuroscientist, and I work on cognitive\nbrain-machine interfaces, or bringing together\nthe brain and the computer. I love brain patterns. Brain patterns are important for us because based on them\nwe can build models for the computers, and based on these models computers can recognize\nhow well our brain functions. And if it doesn't function well, then these computers themselves\ncan be used as assistive devices for therapies. But that also means something, because choosing the wrong patterns will give us the wrong models and therefore the wrong therapies. Right? In case of attention, the fact that we can shift our attention not only by our eyes but also by thinking -- that makes covert attention\nan interesting model for computers. So I wanted to know\nwhat are the brainwave patterns when you look overtly\nor when you look covertly. I set up an experiment for that. In this experiment\nthere are two flickering squares, one of them flickering\nat a slower rate than the other one. Depending on which of these flickers\nyou are paying attention to, certain parts of your brain\nwill start resonating in the same rate as that flickering rate. So by analyzing your brain signals, we can track where exactly\nyou are watching or you are paying attention to. So to see what happens in your brain\nwhen you pay overt attention, I asked people to look directly\nin one of the squares and pay attention to it. In this case, not surprisingly,\nwe saw that these flickering squares appeared in their brain signals which was coming\nfrom the back of their head, which is responsible for the processing\nof your visual information. But I was really interested to see what happens in your brain\nwhen you pay covert attention. So this time I asked people\nto look in the middle of the screen and without moving their eyes, to pay attention\nto either of these squares. When we did that, we saw that both of these flickering rates\nappeared in their brain signals, but interestingly, only one of them,\nwhich was paid attention to, had stronger signals, so there was something in the brain which was handling this information so that thing in the brain was basically\nthe activation of the frontal area. The front part of your brain\nis responsible for higher cognitive functions as a human. The frontal part,\nit seems that it works as a filter trying to let information come in\nonly from the right flicker that you are paying attention to and trying to inhibit the information\ncoming from the ignored one. The filtering ability of the brain\nis indeed a key for attention, which is missing in some people, for example in people with ADHD. So a person with ADHD\ncannot inhibit these distractors, and that's why they can't focus\nfor a long time on a single task. But what if this person could play a specific computer game with his brain connected to the computer, and then train his own brain to inhibit these distractors? Well, ADHD is just one example. We can use these cognitive\nbrain-machine interfaces for many other cognitive fields. It was just a few years ago that my grandfather had a stroke,\nand he lost complete ability to speak. He could understand everybody,\nbut there was no way to respond, even not writing\nbecause he was illiterate. So he passed away in silence. I remember thinking at that time: What if we could have a computer which could speak for him? Now, after years that I am in this field, I can see that this might be possible. Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns when people think\nabout images or even letters, like the letter A generates\na different brainwave pattern than the letter B, and so on. Could a computer one day\ncommunicate for people who can't speak? What if a computer can help us understand\nthe thoughts of a person in a coma? We are not there yet, but pay close attention. We will be there soon. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 22, "lesson": 5, "title": "Can you solve the multiplying rabbits riddle? - Alex Gendler", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-multiplying-rabbits-riddle-alex-gendler", "transcript": {"en": "After years of experiments, you’ve finally created \nthe pets of the future– nano-rabbits! They’re tiny, they’re fuzzy… and they multiply faster \nthan the eye can see. In your lab there are 36 habitat cells, arranged in an inverted pyramid, with 8 cells in the top row. The first has one rabbit, the second has two, and so on, with eight rabbits in the last one. The other rows of cells are empty… for now. The rabbits are hermaphroditic, and each rabbit in a given \ncell will breed once with every rabbit in the horizontally \nadjacent cells, producing exactly one offspring each time. The newborn rabbits will \ndrop into the cell directly below the \ntwo cells of its parents, and within minutes will mature \nand reproduce in turn. Each cell can hold 10^80 nano-rabbits – that’s a 1 followed by 80 zeros – before they break free \nand overrun the world. Your calculations have given you a \n46-digit number for the count of rabbits \nin the bottom cell– plenty of room to spare. But just as you pull the lever \nto start the experiment, your assistant runs in with terrible news. A rival lab has sabotaged your code so that all the zeros at the end \nof your results got cut off. That means you don’t actually know if the bottom cell will be able to hold \nall the rabbits – and the reproduction is already underway! To make matters worse, your devices and calculators \nare all malfunctioning, so you only have a few minutes \nto work it out by hand. How many trailing zeros should there be at the end of the count of rabbits \nin the bottom habitat? And do you need to pull the emergency \nshut-down lever? Pause the video now if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There isn’t enough time to calculate the \nexact number of rabbits in the final cell. The good news is we don’t need to. All we need to figure out is how many trailing zeros it has. But how can we know how many trailing \nzeros a number has without calculating the number itself? What we do know is that we arrive at the\nnumber of rabbits in the bottom cell through a process of multiplication – literally. The number of rabbits in each cell is the product of the number of rabbits \nin each of the two cells above it. And there are only two ways to get numbers with trailing zeros \nthrough multiplication: either multiplying a number ending in 5 \nby any even number, or by multiplying numbers that have \ntrailing zeroes themselves. Let’s calculate the number of rabbits \nin the second row and see what patterns emerge. Two of the numbers have trailing zeros – 20 rabbits in the fourth cell \nand 30 in the fifth cell. But there are no numbers ending in 5. And since the only way to get a number \nending in 5 through multiplication is by starting with a number ending in 5, there won’t be any more \ndown the line either. That means we only need to worry about the numbers that have \ntrailing zeros themselves. And a neat trick to figure out the amount\nof trailing zeros in a product is to count and add the trailing zeros \nin each of the factors – for example, 10 x 100 = 1,000. So let’s take the numbers in the fourth \nand fifth cells and multiply down from there. 20 and 30 each have one zero, so the product of both cells will have \ntwo trailing zeros, while the product of either cell and \nan adjacent non-zero-ending cell will have only one. When we continue all the way down, we end up with 35 zeros \nin the bottom cell. And if you’re not too stressed about \nthe potential nano-rabbit apocalypse, you might notice that counting \nthe zeros this way forms part of Pascal’s triangle. Adding those 35 zeros to the \n46 digit number we had before yields an 81 digit number – too big for the habitat to contain! You rush over and pull \nthe emergency switch just as the seventh generation of rabbits \nwas about to mature – hare-raisingly close to disaster."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many habitat cells are there?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "12"}, {"label": "B", "text": "36"}, {"label": "C", "text": "72"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How are the cells arranged?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "in an inverted pyramid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "in a rectangle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "in a row"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many offspring does each pairing of rabbits produce?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many digits are shown in your calculations?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "13"}, {"label": "B", "text": "24"}, {"label": "C", "text": "46"}, {"label": "D", "text": "50"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the maximum capacity of each cell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10^80 rabbits"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10^70 rabbits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10^90 rabbits"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Wieder", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-survive-nuclear-fallout-brooke-buddemeier-and-jessica-s-wieder", "transcript": {"en": "The full scope of a nuclear detonation \nis almost unimaginable. Hopefully, no one will ever experience \nanother of these catastrophic incidents. But there is a scientifically supported \nplan of action that could save hundreds \nof thousands of lives in the area surrounding \na nuclear explosion. So what is this plan, and what exactly would it protect us from? To create their destructive blast, these weapons harness \nthe power of nuclear fission– in which an atom’s nucleus \nis split in two. This process produces an incredible \namount of energy, and in some materials the neutrons \nproduced by one fission are absorbed by nearby atoms, splitting additional nuclei. These chain reactions can produce \na range of explosive yields, but let’s consider an explosion \nequivalent to 10,000 tons of TNT. An explosion like this would create a fireball capable of decimating \na few city blocks and a shockwave damaging buildings \nseveral kilometers away. There is tragically nothing \nthat can be done to save those in the fireball’s radius. However, for those in the \nshockwave and beyond, our scientifically supported protocol \ncould be life saving. And though it may sound surprising, the best way to stay protected before, \nduring, and after a nuclear detonation, is getting inside. Similar to protecting yourself \nfrom tornadoes or hurricanes, getting and staying inside a sturdy \nbuilding would offer protection from the explosion’s shockwave, \nheat, and radiation. The shockwave of energy would travel several kilometers beyond the fireball’s \nradius in the first few seconds. Sturdy buildings within that range should\nbe able to withstand the shockwave, and staying in the centers and basements \nof these buildings also helps provide protection from \nheat and flying objects. Finding shelter is especially important \nif the fireball occurs close to the earth, as it will pull thousands of tons of dirt \nand debris several kilometers into the atmosphere. As the fireball cools, unstable atoms created by the nuclear \nfission mix with the debris to produce the most dangerous long-term \neffect of a nuclear detonation: radioactive particles called fallout. These sand-sized particles emit \nionizing radiation, capable of separating electrons from \nmolecules and atoms. Exposure to massive amounts of this \nradiation can result in cell damage, radiation burns, radiation sickness, \ncancer, and even death. Created several kilometers up, dangerous concentrations of this material would be driven by upper \natmospheric winds, potentially leading to hazardous \nlevels of fallout in areas up to tens of \nkilometers downwind. Thankfully, the same buildings that offer\nprotection from the blast are even better at \nguarding against fallout. Radiation is reduced as it travels \nthrough space and mass. So while a broken window and sealed window both have the same minimal \neffect on radiation, thick layers of steel, concrete, \nand packed earth can offer serious protection. And since fallout gives off half of its \nenergy in the first hour and 80% in the first day, staying inside for 24 hours could \ndramatically improve the odds of avoiding the most serious \neffects of radiation. Following the blast there would be at \nleast 15 minutes to find shelter before the fallout begins. Since the most hazardous fallout particles\nare the heaviest, they sink through the air and collect on streets and rooftops, making ideal shelters underground \nor in the middle of high-rise buildings. But if someone were to get \ncaught in the fallout, there are still measures they could take. After finding a safe space, they should remove their shoes \nand outer layers, wash any exposed skin, and store the contaminated \nclothing far away. Once inside, plan on staying there \nfor at least 24 hours. If the shelter is poor, or someone \ninside needs urgent medical attention, try seeking outside help after an hour. But ideally, stay inside and stay tuned for more \ninformation from first responders. While electric power, cell service, and\nInternet would be down, most radios would likely survive. So listen in for emergency responders to determine the safest course forward.

{"page": 22, "lesson": 7, "title": "The science of Flint's water crisis", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/HSPnp900", "transcript": {"en": "[♪ INTRO] In April of 2014, under the control of an\nEmergency Manager appointed by the state of Michigan to help the city\nthrough an ongoing financial crisis, Flint, Michigan switched its water supply. For decades, the city’s water had been piped\nin from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department, which got its water from Lake Huron and treated it. But in April of 2013, the decision was made\nto build a pipeline and connect to a new system, the Karegnondi Water Authority. This would supply the city with lake water\nthat Flint would treat instead of Detroit, and was estimated to save 200 million dollars\nover 25 years. In the meantime, as a sort of temporary fix\nwhile the pipeline was being built, water would come in from the Flint River and be\ntreated at Flint's water treatment plant. Now, 4 years after that switch, we know that\nit damaged hundreds of millions of dollars of infrastructure, caused deadly bacterial\noutbreaks that killed at least 12 people, and exposed thousands of children to high\nlevels of lead in their drinking water. There are places to learn about the story\nof how this happened, was covered up, and was eventually recognized, and the underlying situations that caused these massive mistakes to be made. So let's talk about the science of water. And how something as seemingly simple as a\nswitching to a different water source could lead to so many bad, but also seemingly unrelated,\noutcomes. Humans have actually been using lead pipes\nin water systems for hundreds of years, dating back to the ancient Romans. We eventually moved on to using other materials,\nlike iron. But in the late 1800s, engineers in the U.S.\nwere all about lead, because lead pipes were easier to bend around obstacles and were a\nbit more durable than iron. People were suffering from lead poisoning,\nbut the public health risks weren’t seriously acknowledged until around the 1920s. And we gradually stopped making new water\npipes from lead. But in lots of cities in the U.S., like Flint,\nMichigan, there are still several different kinds of metals in pipes for water. In Flint’s case, the pipes are made of lead\nand iron. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn’t\nhave any sort of serious regulation about lead pipes until the Lead and Copper Rule\nwas enacted in 1991. It requires regular monitoring and action\nplans if old lead pipes start becoming dangerous. So, all that to say, lead water pipes are\nnot that unusual, a 2016 study estimates that\nthere are still millions in use. And even though no amount of lead ingested\nby a human is considered safe, maybe surprisingly, many of these\nwater systems are usually safe. A big part of the reason why is anti-corrosion\nchemicals in the water, like orthophosphate. Orthophosphate helps lead and some other metal\npipes from corroding by forming a compound that makes a sort of protective layer on the\ninside of the pipe. If that layer is patchy or missing, then electron-stealing\nchemicals called oxidants, like dissolved oxygen gas, can react with the lead. And when that happens, the lead will dissolve\ninto the water and contaminate it. You’ve probably heard of that. It’s known as leaching, and it’s when\nthings get dangerous for people who need this water to drink or shower or do anything with\non their bodies. Flint, and it is unclear why besides possibly\ncutting costs, did not add orthophosphate or any sort of anti-corrosion chemicals when\nswitching to Flint River water. Even though the treated water from Detroit\nhad had them. And because Flint was using iron and lead\npipes, both iron and lead ended up in the water. But that’s not the whole story. Not only were these pipes left unprotected,\nbut the water flowing through them also contained higher than average chloride levels. Research has found that chloride helps the\nprocess of corrosion along. When there are enough chloride ions in the\nwater compared to some other ions, they start forming chemical complexes with lead and other\natoms. And these chloride complexes are soluble. So, basically, it’s another way that lead\ncan get into the water. Part of this too-much-chloride problem was\nfrom the river water itself. Sodium chloride, which is just table salt,\nwould often wash into the river after being used as a de-icer on roads. But another part of it had to do with the\nfact that, a couple of months after the switch to the Flint River water, there was also a\nhuge bacterial problem. The river water wasn’t just, like, extremely\ndangerous, though. We know how to treat water. We put in disinfectants like chlorine, which can rip\nopen bacteria or mess with the molecules inside them. But it turns out that chlorine disinfectant\ncan react with metals from corroding pipes, especially iron, to become completely different compounds that do absolutely\nnothing to control bacteria. So the disinfectants were made useless. Plus, more chloride ions ended up floating\naround, which only made the corrosion process worse. And thus, the vicious cycle escalated. By August of 2014, there was a city warning\nthat E. coli and other typically gut-dwelling bacteria, collectively called fecal coliform\nbacteria, were thriving in the water and could make people sick. The Flint treatment plant upped the amount\nof chlorine they were using to try to kill off these contaminants. But because the pipes were already corroding,\nit wasn’t working. Not only that, but all this extra chlorine\nthey were adding also reacted with some of the organic chemicals from the river water\nto form disinfection byproducts called trihalomethanes. And, researchers have found trihalomethanes\nto be linked to health problems and even cancer. So not only was the chlorine turning into\na bunch of non-disinfectant chemicals, one of those was potentially a carcinogen. Trihalomethanes in the water quickly swelled\nto above the national regulatory limit. So to try and fix that problem, the treatment\nplant added coagulants that would react with the organic matter in the water to help them\nfilter it out. Specifically, they used a chemical called\nferric chloride. Which took care of the trihalomethanes, but meant they were adding\neven more chloride to the water. As the pipes got worse and more chlorine was\nturned into useless compounds, the elevated bacterial levels became deadly. Between April 2014 and October 2015, at least\n12 people died and 91 people got sick from an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease, the\nthird largest recorded in U.S. history. Before the switch to the Flint River water,\nthere were only a handful of cases per year. Legionnaires’ disease is basically a really\nintense pneumonia. It’s caused by breathing in water-borne\nbacteria that infect the lungs so they get inflamed and lead to other symptoms. This outbreak was caused by a bacterium called\nLegionella pneumophila, specifically the serogroup 6 strain, which isn’t usually detected in\nthe standard urine test for the disease. After some extensive studies, most researchers\nagree that this chlorine inactivation at least played a part in letting these bacteria flourish. On top of that, some of the experts and investigative journalists think that there could have been more deaths than were officially confirmed, because of how tricky it can be\nto diagnose Legionnaires’ disease. Some deaths caused by these bacterias could\nhave been attributed to pneumonia in general, and thus not counted. So, counterintuitive as it might seem, not\nadding corrosion control also deactivated the chlorine disinfectant to basically undetectable\nlevels, resulting in tragic loss of life. In addition to all this, though, there was the ongoing\nproblem of metals leaching into the water supply. Which we definitely know was because of how\nthe Flint River water was treated. Because of all these chemical reactions, the\nprocess by which lead and other metals got into the water was not slow and constant. Sometimes the pipes would leach metal slowly. But sometimes metal compounds, like the protective\nlayer that wasn’t being maintained, flaked off in little hunks, some of which were even\nvisible to the naked eye. The leached iron made the water look kind\nof horrible and taste kind of rusty, but it isn’t a big health concern on its own. Lead is. But you can’t see, smell, or taste it in\nwater. A single tiny lead flake can take water from\nsafe, to far over the EPA’s limit of 15 parts per billion, which requires public action\nto be taken. And besides randomly super contaminated samples\nbeing right next to uncontaminated samples because of flakes, the protocols for testing\nfor lead can be manipulated to make it less likely to record how contaminated the water\nactually is. Official EPA protocols for measuring drinking\nwater quality involves letting the water sit in pipes for at least 6 hours, and then collecting\nit after a couple minutes. City protocols called for pre-flushing\nthe pipes for five minutes before letting them sit for 6 hours. And, according to experts, this pre-flushing\ncan sweep out initial bursts of lead particles so they’re not in the sample. Plus, people don’t just go turning on their\nwater every once in a while, so those samples aren’t necessarily reflective of what they’re\nusing and drinking. Even still, when the City of Flint tested\none resident’s water in February and March of 2015, they found lead levels at 104 ppb\nand 397 ppb, far above the EPA’s action level. When researchers from Virginia Tech sampled\nwater from the same pipes at low, medium, and high flow rates, they found levels ranging\nfrom 220 ppb to a whopping 13,200 ppb. And, to be totally clear about how intense\nthis is, a substance with more than 5,000 parts per billion of lead is considered hazardous\nwaste by the EPA. By September 2015, those same researchers\nhad collected and analyzed 252 water samples from various Flint homes. 101 of the samples had more than 5 ppb of\nlead. And they estimated that 90% of homes had a\nlead level below 25 ppb; 10% were above that. Which, and I can’t say this enough, was a lot of homes above that 15 parts per billion EPA limit for water. Protocols matter, y'all! So that's how metals ended up in the water. No corrosion control and high\ncorrosive chemical concentrations exposed many thousands\nof people to lead poisoning. And lead poisoning can cause incredibly serious\nhealth problems. Lead interferes with a lot of different enzymes,\ncan cause cells to die, and can slip past the protective blood-brain barrier to seriously\nmess with the central nervous system. We don’t know exactly how it interacts with\nall those systems, but lead ions are chemically pretty similar to calcium ions, which our\nbodies use all the time in lots of chemical processes. So that may have something to do with it. In any case, it’s incredibly detrimental\nto human bodies and brains, in adults and especially in children. All of this was made worse by the fact that\nthe city of Flint has a water system built to deliver water to over 200,000 people. Since the population peaked at around that in\nthe 1960s, it has declined to less than half that. So in some areas, the water moved through\nsome pipes slowly or sat stagnant. As the Flint River water sat in the pipes\nand the corrosive chemistry did its thing, metal concentration rose, disinfectant concentration\ndecreased, and bacterial growth increased. The city of Flint switched back to piping\nin treated water from the Detroit water system in October 2015, after 18 months. And they’re adding in extra phosphate chemicals\nto try to build up that protective layer again. But that doesn't just fix the problem that\nhad escalated over that year and a half. The pipes have already corroded, as have plumbing\nfixtures and water heaters of many residents. So while the gradual leaching is hopefully\ngoing down, metal flakes may still be chipping off. Tests show that lead levels are down,\nand that’s great news, but many residents have also, understandably, lost faith in the government agencies that are now\nreporting that the water is safe. The city is now undergoing a massively expensive\nprocess of replacing all of its lead pipes. A step that was taken to save money has ended\nup costing far more money than it could have saved, not to mention lost health, and lost\nlives. The way that science was ignored, unknown,\nor even misused in this story is a lesson that we all have to live with, and one that\nwe at SciShow hope that we can learn from.

Mellor", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-thor-got-his-hammer-scott-a-mellor", "transcript": {"en": "Loki the mischief-maker, was writhing\nuncomfortably in Thor’s iron grip. The previous night, while the rest of the\ngods slept, he’d snuck up on Thor’s wife Sif and shorn off her beautiful hair. It’d seemed like a funny \nprank at the time, but now Thor was about to\nbreak every bone in his body. Loki had to think of some\nway to fix what he’d done. Yet who could replace Sif’s matchless\nhair, golden like a field of summer wheat? The dwarves! – their legendary\nsmiths could make anything. So Loki rushed to their realm, \ndeep within the mountains of the earth. Even before he arrived, the wily Loki was\nalready scheming how he would get the\ndwarves to do his bidding. He decided that his best bet was to pit\ntwo families against each other. He first visited the masterful\nsons of Ivaldi.  He told them that their rivals,\na pair of brothers named Brokk and Eitri, had claimed that they were the best\ncraftsmen in the world and were determined to prove\nit in a competition. The rules were that each family had to \ncreate three gifts for the gods, including, for the Ivaldis, golden hair. Then Loki visited Brokk and Eitri,\nand told them the same thing,  only now claiming that the sons\nof Ivaldi had issued the challenge. But Brokk and Eitri couldn’t \nbe fooled so easily, and only agreed to participate\nif Loki put his own head on the line. Literally—if Brokk and Eitri won, \nLoki would forfeit his head to them. Loki had no choice but to agree,\nand to save himself had to find a way to make sure the sons of\nIvaldi emerged victorious. Both sets of dwarves got to work. Eitri set Brokk to man the bellows and\ntold him not to stop for any reason, or the treasures would be ruined. Soon a strange black fly\nflew into the room. As a piece of pigskin was placed in the\nforge, the fly stung Brokk’s hand, but he didn’t flinch. Next, while Eitri worked a block of gold,\nthe fly bit Brokk on the neck. The dwarf carried on. Finally, Eitri placed a piece\nof iron in the furnace. This time the fly landed right on Brokk’s\neyelid and bit as hard as it could. And for just a split second,\nBrokk’s hand left the bellows. That’s all it took; their final treasure\nhadn’t stayed in the fire long enough. Loki now reappeared in his normal form,\noverjoyed by their failure, and accompanied the dwarves to present\ntheir treasures to the gods. First, Loki presented the treasures\nfrom the sons of Ivaldi. Their golden hair bound to Sif’s\nhead and continued to grow, leaving her even more radiant than before. Next, for Odin the all-father, a magnificent spear that could\npierce through anything. And finally a small cloth that unfolded\ninto a mighty ship built for Freyr, god of the harvest. Then Brokk presented the treasures\nmade by him and his brother. For Freyr they’d forged \na golden-bristled boar who’d pull Freyr’s chariot across\nthe sky faster than any mount. For Odin, a golden arm ring which would\nmake eight more identical rings on every ninth night. And for Thor, a hammer called Mjolnir. Its handle was too short,\nand Loki smirked at the obvious defect. But then Brokk revealed its abilities. Mjolnir would never shatter, \nnever miss its mark and always return\nto Thor’s hand when thrown. Despite the short handle, the gods all \nagreed this was the finest gift of all. Remembering what was at stake, Loki tried \nto flee, but Thor reached him first. But before the dwarves could have their due, clever Loki pointed out that they had won\nthe rights to his head, but not his neck, and thus had no right to cut it. All begrudgingly admitted the truth in that,\nbut Brokk would have the last laugh. Taking his brother’s awl,\nhe pierced it through Loki’s lips and sewed his mouth shut, so the trickster god could no longer\nspread his malicious deceit. Yet the irony was not lost on the gods. For it was Loki’s deceit that had brought\nthem these fine treasures and given Thor the hammer\nfor which he’s still known today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Sif’s hair was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Green as a spring tree"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Brown as an oak’s bark"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Golden as summer wheat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Blond as the sun in mid-summer"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What did Loki wager?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "His neck"}, {"label": "B", "text": "His head"}, {"label": "C", "text": "His life"}, {"label": "D", "text": "His golden boar"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "To prevent the dwarves from winning, Loki turned himself into:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a fly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "a bat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a mosquito"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a butterfly"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What did the sons of Ivaldi give to Odin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a golden boar that can pull his chariot"}, {"label": "B", "text": "a ship that folds up into his pocket"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a spear that could pierce through anything"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a golden armring that produces eight more every ninth night"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What did Brokk do as punishment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cut off Loki’s head"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sewed shut Loki’s mouth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pierced through Loki’s eye"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cut off Loki’s ears"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

So we're seeing a rise of this availability being driven by mobile device proliferation, globally, across all social strata. We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices, an expectation of availability. And, with that, comes the third point, which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability. And the problem is, we're still working through, from a societal standpoint, how we allow people to be available. There's a significant delta, in fact, between what we're willing to accept. Apologies to Hans Rosling -- he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie -- but the big delta there is how we deal with this from a public standpoint. So we've developed certain tactics and strategies to cover up. This first one's called \"the lean.\" And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting \"chicken,\" you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away, and then quickly checking the device. Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him. \"The stretch.\" OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, \"Screw you, I'm going to check my device.\" But the guy, here, on the right, he's doing the stretch. It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion to get that device just below the tabletop. Or, my favorite, the \"Love you; mean it.\" (Laughter) Nothing says \"I love you\" like \"Let me find somebody else I give a damn about.\" Or, this one, coming to us from India. You can find this on YouTube, the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle while text messaging. Or what we call the \"sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!\" That is actually the device. What this is doing is, we find a -- (Laughter) a direct collision -- we find a direct collision between availability -- and what's possible through availability -- and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually -- the need to create shared narratives. We're very good at creating personal narratives, but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture. And when you're standing with someone, and you're on your mobile device, effectively what you're saying to them is, \"You are not as important as, literally, almost anything that could come to me through this device.\" Look around you. There might be somebody on one right now, participating in multi-dimensional engagement. (Laughter) Our reality right now is less interesting than the story we're going to tell about it later. This one I love. This poor kid, clearly a prop -- don't get me wrong, a willing prop -- but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks. This is the sound of one hand clapping. So, as we lose the context of our identity, it becomes incredibly important that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative, becomes the context in which we live. The stories that we tell -- what we push out -- becomes who we are. People aren't simply projecting identity, they're creating it. And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room. We are creating the technology that is going to create the new shared experience, which will create the new world. And so my request is, please, let's make technologies that make people more human, and not less. Thank you."}, "multiple-choice": []}

But when a British destroyer came to\ncollect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white\ncat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat\nhunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered\nthe hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before\nretiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable\nsailors, or cooperative companions \nof any kind. But cats have been working alongside\nhumans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go \nfrom wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than\n10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature\nto their will, producing much more food than\nfarmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess\ngrain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted\nhordes of rodents, as well as their predator,\nFelis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa\nand Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce,\ncarnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size\nand appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient\nwildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social\ntowards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested \ngranaries drew in these typically solitary animals.  And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the \npresence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated\nthe cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that\nthe cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe\nand the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major\nscourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and\ngnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become\nessential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian\nglobe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated \ntheir own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch\nvenomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important\nto Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos,\nhieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay.  And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate\nfrom port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire,\nships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the\ncentral Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, \nEgyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern \nand North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point -- \ncontinued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for\nAustralia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern\nor the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and\ncoat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone \ncenturies of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically\nvery similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them\nmore social and docile, we’ve done little to alter\ntheir natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or\nless as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t\nsee us as their keepers.

If you try to cheat\nby saying something paradoxical, like, ‘this statement is false,’ then I'll eat your brother \nand the creatures.\" What true/false statement\ncan you say to force the troll to free your brother\nand the paradoxical creatures? [Pause the video now if you\nwant to figure it out for yourself!] Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This seems like an impossible situation, but incredibly, you can say something that will force the troll to\nrelease all its prisoners. This is an example of coercive logic, invented by the great logician \nand puzzle creator Raymond Smullyan. The trick Smullyan came up with\ninvolves saying a statement whose truth or falseness depends on\nwhat you want the troll to do. Your statement still\nhas to be carefully crafted. For example, if you were to say, “You are going to free the \ncreatures and my brother,” the troll could respond, “that’s false… \nI’m only going to free your brother.” Similarly, if you said, “You will free \nthe paradoxes,” the troll could say, “That’s true,” \nand free the paradoxes. But watch what happens if you say,\n“You will free my brother.” The statement can’t be false, because if it were, the troll, \nby its own rules, would have to free your brother. That would make the statement\nparadoxically true and false. But the troll hates paradoxes and would never willingly create one. So his only option \nis for the statement to be true. If “you will free my brother” is true, then the troll \nhas to release your brother. And by its own rules, the troll\nhas to free the creatures as well, since you said a true statement. By wielding just 5 words\nlike a logical scalpel, you’ve forced the troll\nto free all its prisoners. As the troll stomps off in anger, the paradoxes cheer you\nfor winning them their freedom, and promise to lead you to the\ntreasure at the top of the stairs. If you can reach it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What will the troll do if you say something true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Release the paradoxical creatures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Release your brother"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Release everyone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Release no one"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What will the troll do if you say something false?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Release the paradoxical creatures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Release your brother"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Release everyone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Release no one"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What will the troll do if you say a paradox like “this statement is false?\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Release the paradoxical creatures"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Release your brother"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Release everyone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Release no one"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who invented coercive logic?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Benjamin Franklin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Raymond Smullyan"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bertrand Russell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "M.

{"page": 22, "lesson": 12, "title": "Can animals be deceptive? - Eldridge Adams", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-animals-be-deceptive-eldridge-adams", "transcript": {"en": "A male firefly glows above a field \non a summer’s night, emitting a series of enticing flashes. He hopes a nearby female will respond\nwith her own lightshow and mate with him. Sadly for this male, it won’t turn out quite the way he plans. A female from a different species \nmimics his pulsing patterns: by tricking the male with \nher promise of partnership, she lures him in– and turns him into an easy meal. He’s been deceived. Behavioral biologists have identified \nthree defining hallmarks of deception by non-human animals: it must mislead the receiver, the deceiver must benefit, and it can’t simply be an accident. In this case we know that the predatory \nfirefly’s signal isn’t an accident because she flexibly \nadjusts her flash pattern to match males of different species. Based on this definition, where is animal deception seen in nature? Camouflage is a good starting point– and one of the most familiar examples \nof animal trickery. The leaf-tailed gecko and the \noctopus fool viewers by blending into the surfaces \non which they rest. Other animals use mimicry \nto protect themselves. Harmless scarlet kingsnakes have evolved \nred, yellow, and black patterns resembling those of the venomous \neastern coral snake to benefit from the protective warnings \nthese markings convey. Even some plants use mimicry: there are orchids that look and smell like\nfemale wasps to attract hapless males, who end up pollinating the plant. Some of these animals benefit \nby having fixed characteristics that are evolutionary suited \nto their environments. But in other cases, the deceiver seems to anticipate \nthe reactions of other animals and to adjust its behavior accordingly. Sensing a threat, the octopus will rapidly change its colors\nto match its surroundings. Dwarf chameleons color-match their \nenvironments more closely when they see a bird predator \nrather than a snake– birds, after all, \nhave better color vision. One of the more fascinating \nexamples of animal deception comes from the fork-tailed drongo. This bird sits atop tall trees \nin the Kalahari Desert, surveying the landscape for predators \nand calling when it senses a threat. That sends meerkats, pied babblers, \nand others dashing for cover. But the drongo will also sound \na false alarm when those other species \nhave captured prey. As the meerkats and babblers flee, the drongo swoops down \nto steal their catches. This tactic works about half the time– and it provides drongos \nwith much of their food. There are fewer solid cases of animals using signals to trick members \nof their own species, but that happens too. Consider the mantis shrimp. Like other crustaceans, it molts as it grows, which leaves its soft body \nvulnerable to attack. But it’s still driven to protect \nits home against rivals. So it has become a masterful bluffer. Despite being fragile, a newly molted shrimp is actually \nmore likely to threaten intruders, spreading the large limbs it usually uses \nto strike or stab its opponents. And that works – bluffers are more likely to keep \ntheir homes than non-bluffers. In its softened condition, a mantis shrimp couldn’t \nwithstand a fight– which is why we can be confident that its behavior is a bluff. Biologists have even noticed \nthat its bluffs are tactical: newly molted mantis shrimp are more likely\nto bluff against smaller rivals, who are especially likely \nto be driven away. It would seem that instead of just \nthreatening reflexively, the mantis shrimp is swiftly gauging the \nsituation and predicting others’ behavior, to get the best result. So we know that animals can deceive, but do they do so with intent? That’s a difficult question, and many scientists think \nwe'll never be able to answer it. We can't observe animals’ \ninternal thoughts. But we don’t need to know what an animal \nis thinking in order to detect deception. By watching behavior and its outcomes, we learn that animals manipulate \npredators, prey, and rivals, and that their capacity for deception can be surprisingly complex."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does a female firefly trick a male from another species?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She mimics the noise of females from his species"}, {"label": "B", "text": "She mimics the flash patterns of females from his species"}, {"label": "C", "text": "She changes the color of her flash"}, {"label": "D", "text": "She releases an odor similar to females from his species"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How did harmless scarlet kingsnakes evolve to evade predators?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They have similar markings to the venomous eastern coral snake"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are sand colored to blend in with the ground"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can change colors to match their surroundings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are green in order to easily hide in trees"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How does the fork-tailed drongo deceive other animals?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It makes a noise similar to predators to make prey run away"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It plays dead to surprise attack"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It makes a noise to falsely alert other animals that predators are around"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It expands its wings to look larger than it actually is"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Is a newly molted mantis shrimp more or less likely to threaten intruders in its home?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More likely"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Less Likely"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Do animals deceive other animals with intent?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}, {"label": "C", "text": "We don’t know and we may never know"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

He had secured funding from the Norwegian\nCrown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of\nthe famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, \nspecially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had \none final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the\nopposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had\nbeen visited and mapped, with only two key locations\nremaining: the North Pole, deep in the\nfrozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a\nrecently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of\nreaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers\nFrederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims\nto the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to\nwhat he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t \nthe only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had\nalready visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own \nSouth Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova \nreached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news\nthat Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted\nagainst the Norwegian in what the newspapers \ncalled a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race,\nit was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times\nfrom different locations, and they had very different \nplans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely\non reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and \nNorwegian experience, arriving with a small team of\nmen and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed\nin sealskin and furs, as well as specially\ndesigned skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific \nresearch expedition, he traveled with over three times \nmore men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs, \n19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art\nmotorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled\nthe storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and \nmotor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out\nthe long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled \nover the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's\nearlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been\ndocumented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time\nusing a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first\nat their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded\nCook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed\nthe area in a grid to make sure they covered\nthe Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would\nnot be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party\nfinally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was\nthe least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp,\ntwo of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a\nprearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, \nmisjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary,\nwould not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic \nresearch stations. But the journeys of these early\nexplorers are not forgotten.

{"page": 22, "lesson": 15, "title": "Why you should talk to strangers - Kio Stark", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/gmhCPPoK", "transcript": {"en": "There are things we say when we catch the eye of a stranger or a neighbor walking by. We say, \"Hello, how are you? It's a beautiful day. How do you feel?\" These sound kind of meaningless, right?\nAnd, in some ways, they are. They have no semantic meaning. It doesn't matter how you are\nor what the day is like. They have something else. They have social meaning. What we mean when we say those things is: I see you there. I'm obsessed with talking to strangers. I make eye contact, say hello, I offer help, I listen. I get all kinds of stories. About seven years ago, I started\ndocumenting my experiences to try to figure out why. What I found was that something\nreally beautiful was going on. This is almost poetic. These were really profound experiences. They were unexpected pleasures. They were genuine emotional connections. They were liberating moments. So one day, I was standing on a corner\nwaiting for the light to change, which, I'm a New Yorker, so that means I was actually standing\nin the street on the storm drain, as if that could get me across faster. And there's an old man\nstanding next to me. So he's wearing, like, a long overcoat\nand sort of an old-man hat, and he looked like somebody from a movie. And he says to me, \"Don't stand there. You might disappear.\" So this is absurd, right? But I did what he said.\nI stepped back onto the sidewalk. And he smiled, and he said, \"Good. You never know. I might have turned around, and zoop, you're gone.\" This was weird, and also really wonderful. He was so warm, and he was\nso happy that he'd saved me. We had this little bond. For a minute, I felt like\nmy existence as a person had been noticed, and I was worth saving. The really sad thing is, in many parts of the world, we're raised to believe\nthat strangers are dangerous by default, that we can't trust them,\nthat they might hurt us. But most strangers aren't dangerous. We're uneasy around them\nbecause we have no context. We don't know what their intentions are. So instead of using our perceptions\nand making choices, we rely on this category of \"stranger.\" I have a four-year-old. When I say hello to people on the street, she asks me why. She says, \"Do we know them?\" I say, \"No, they're our neighbor.\" \"Are they our friend?\" \"No, it's just good to be friendly.\" I think twice every time\nI say that to her, because I mean it,\nbut as a woman, particularly, I know that not every stranger\non the street has the best intentions. It is good to be friendly,\nand it's good to learn when not to be, but none of that means\nwe have to be afraid. There are two huge benefits to using our senses instead of our fears. The first one is that it liberates us. When you think about it, using perception instead of categories is much easier said than done. Categories are something our brains use. When it comes to people, it's sort of a shortcut\nfor learning about them. We see male, female, young, old, black, brown, white, stranger, friend, and we use the information in that box. It's quick, it's easy and it's a road to bias. And it means we're not thinking\nabout people as individuals. I know an American researcher\nwho travels frequently in Central Asia and Africa, alone. She's entering into towns and cities as a complete stranger. She has no bonds, no connections. She's a foreigner. Her survival strategy is this: get one stranger to see you\nas a real, individual person. If you can do that, it'll help\nother people see you that way, too. The second benefit of using our senses\nhas to do with intimacy. I know it sounds\na little counterintuitive, intimacy and strangers, but these quick interactions\ncan lead to a feeling that sociologists call\n\"fleeting intimacy.\" So, it's a brief experience\nthat has emotional resonance and meaning. It's the good feeling I got from being saved from the death trap\nof the storm drain by the old man, or how I feel like part of a community when I talk to somebody\non my train on the way to work. Sometimes it goes further. Researchers have found\nthat people often feel more comfortable being honest and open\nabout their inner selves with strangers than they do with their friends\nand their families -- that they often feel\nmore understood by strangers. This gets reported in the media\nwith great lament. \"Strangers communicate\nbetter than spouses!\" It's a good headline, right? I think it entirely misses the point. The important thing about these studies is just how significant\nthese interactions can be; how this special form of closeness gives us something we need\nas much as we need our friends and our families. So how is it possible that we communicate\nso well with strangers? There are two reasons. The first one is that\nit's a quick interaction. It has no consequences. It's easy to be honest with someone\nyou're never going to see again, right? That makes sense. The second reason is where\nit gets more interesting. We have a bias when it comes\nto people we're close to. We expect them to understand us. We assume they do, and we expect them to read our minds. So imagine you're at a party, and you can't believe\nthat your friend or your spouse isn't picking up on it\nthat you want to leave early. And you're thinking, \"I gave you the look.\" With a stranger, we have\nto start from scratch. We tell the whole story, we explain who the people are,\nhow we feel about them; we spell out all the inside jokes. And guess what? Sometimes they do\nunderstand us a little better. OK. So now that we know\nthat talking to strangers matters, how does it work? There are unwritten rules\nwe tend to follow. The rules are very different\ndepending on what country you're in, what culture you're in. In most parts of the US, the baseline expectation in public is that we maintain a balance\nbetween civility and privacy. This is known as civil inattention. So, imagine two people are walking\ntowards each other on the street. They'll glance at each other\nfrom a distance. That's the civility, the acknowledgment. And then as they get closer,\nthey'll look away, to give each other some space. In other cultures, people go to extraordinary lengths\nnot to interact at all. People from Denmark tell me that many Danes are so averse\nto talking to strangers, that they would rather\nmiss their stop on the bus than say \"excuse me\" to someone\nthat they need to get around. Instead, there's this elaborate\nshuffling of bags and using your body to say\nthat you need to get past, instead of using two words. In Egypt, I'm told, it's rude to ignore a stranger, and there's a remarkable\nculture of hospitality. Strangers might ask each other\nfor a sip of water. Or, if you ask someone for directions, they're very likely\nto invite you home for coffee. We see these unwritten rules\nmost clearly when they're broken, or when you're in a new place and you're trying to figure out\nwhat the right thing to do is. Sometimes breaking the rules a little bit\nis where the action is. In case it's not clear,\nI really want you to do this. OK? So here's how it's going to go. Find somebody who is making eye contact. That's a good signal. The first thing is a simple smile. If you're passing somebody on the street\nor in the hallway here, smile. See what happens. Another is triangulation. There's you, there's a stranger, there's some third thing\nthat you both might see and comment on, like a piece of public art or somebody preaching in the street or somebody wearing funny clothes. Give it a try. Make a comment about that third thing,\nand see if starts a conversation. Another is what I call noticing. This is usually giving a compliment. I'm a big fan of noticing people's shoes. I'm actually not wearing\nfabulous shoes right now, but shoes are fabulous in general. And they're pretty neutral\nas far as giving compliments goes. People always want to tell you things\nabout their awesome shoes. You may have already experienced\nthe dogs and babies principle. It can be awkward\nto talk to someone on the street; you don't know how\nthey're going to respond. But you can always talk\nto their dog or their baby. The dog or the baby is a social conduit to the person, and you can tell by how they respond whether they're open to talking more. The last one I want to challenge you to is disclosure. This is a very vulnerable thing to do, and it can be very rewarding. So next time you're talking to a stranger and you feel comfortable, tell them something true about yourself, something really personal. You might have that experience\nI talked about of feeling understood. Sometimes in conversation, it comes up, people ask me, \"What does your dad do?\"\nor, \"Where does he live?\" And sometimes I tell them the whole truth, which is that he died when I was a kid. Always in those moments, they share their own experiences of loss. We tend to meet\ndisclosure with disclosure, even with strangers. So, here it is. When you talk to strangers,\nyou're making beautiful interruptions into the expected narrative\nof your daily life and theirs. You're making unexpected connections. If you don't talk to strangers,\nyou're missing out on all of that. We spend a lot of time teaching our children about strangers. What would happen if we spent\nmore time teaching ourselves? We could reject all the ideas\nthat make us so suspicious of each other. We could make a space for change. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But that wasn’t always true. As recently as 50,000 years ago we walked\nthe planet along with at least three other human species. Denisovans and real-life Hobbits Homo floresiensis\ndidn’t leave much behind to know them by, but Neanderthals are a different story. A richer story. The first people to hold Neanderthal skulls\ndidn’t know what to make of them, until Charles Darwin published his theory of evolution. Like every living thing, modern humans must\nhave descended from an earlier species, and lots of scientists thought Neanderthals\nfit the bill: our primitive, slightly dim-witted ancestor. Ernst Haeckel even tried to name them Homo\nstupidus. Other scientists had different ideas, they\nrebuilt skeletons to look like cartoon cavemen, instead insisting Neanderthals were some failed,\nevolutionary dead end. So: Where do Neanderthals fit in the human\nstory? Were they a bunch of cotton-headed ninny-muggins? Or were they more intelligent and human\nthan we give them credit for? And if they were smart, why did they disappear\nafter they met us? Did Neanderthals really disappear? [OPEN] If you were sharing a subway car with a bunch\nof humans and a well-groomed Neanderthal, you might not be able to tell who’s who. Buuuut that’s New York for you. But there were some differences: The big brow\nridge. And huge nose. The weirdly short forearms and shins. And BIG muscles. These were all adaptations to life in cold\nnorthern climates, while our skinny ancestors were built for a warmer, runnier existence. Our bodies are different, but similar enough\nthat when Neanderthals and our species first met, we would’ve seen something familiar\nstaring back at us. Neanderthal life carried serious occupational\nhazards, considering dinner meant going head to head with wooly mammoths and rhinoceros\nlike some Paleolithic rodeo riders. Their fossil remains show healed broken bones,\neven signs that some were blind, meaning Neanderthal tribes cared for and fed their sick and injured. They even buried their dead. We don’t know if that’s because they were\nspiritual, or religious, but Neanderthals definitely weren’t violent brutes. They were caring and social. By 250,000 years ago, there were brains walking\naround in Germany as big or bigger than yours or mine… only inside Neanderthal skulls. But if big brains were *everything*, blue\nwhales would be our overlords! They’re… not, right? Neanderthals used this tool about 200,000\nyears ago. 150,000 years later their technology had progressed\nto this. Not ex actly Steve Jobs. It’s clearly not the size of a brain,\nit’s how you use it. Our symbolic thinking, social interactions,\ntechnological innovation, and dad jokes just wouldn’t be possible without our brain’s\nability to fancy words together make. You know: intricate phraseology. Elaborate discourse. Complex language! So could Neanderthals talk? We know that we and Neanderthals share the\nsame version of a gene, FOXP2, that’s essential for language, but that gene alone isn’t\nenough to make a caveman Shakespeare. The shape of Neanderthal brains inside their\nskulls suggest they had structures important for speech. Their throats were shaped to make more than\nape sounds. That’s most of the ingredients for *some*\nkind of speech and language. But rich communication is possible even without\nmouth noises. Scientists think Neanderthals could have exchanged\nideas and told stories by combining simple sounds, musical tones, and rhythmic movement…\njust like prehistoric boy bands. [MUSIC] Around 50,000 YA Neanderthals met their very\nsmart cousins: Us. For five or ten thousand winters and summers,\nour ranges overlapped, until Neanderthals suddenly disappeared–poof– about 40,000\nyears ago. Were we friends? Or enemies? Wherever our nomadic hunting groups clashed\nfor territory, our species had deadlier weapons. Whereas Neanderthals lived in socially isolated\ngroups, we readily exchanged technology between tribes, even traded. When it came to innovation and competition\nfor resources, Neanderthals just couldn’t catch up. Or maybe we just gave them an extinction-level\ncase of the flu. At their peak, Neanderthal populations probably\nnever reached six figures worldwide. Like gorillas and orangutans today, they lived\nin small, dispersed pockets--which means more inbreeding and less genetic diversity. Maybe Neanderthals were already endangered\nwhen we showed up. Before they disappeared, Neanderthals left\nus one present. In 2010, the Neanderthal genome was sequenced\nfrom ancient bones. That genome was compared to modern human genomes. 1 to 4 percent of the genes from ALL living\nhumans outside sub-Saharan Africa came from Neanderthals. People with sub-Saharan ancestry? No Neanderthal DNA. This tells us Homo sapiens shared a romantic\ncampfire with Neanderthals and interbred, probably right after our species left Africa,\nspreading that Neanderthal DNA as we settled the rest of the globe. Thanks to genetic testing, I know I have more\nNeanderthal DNA than 70% of people, which to me is proof that Neanderthals were definitely\nintelligent and awesome. So 50,000 years ago we walked beside other\nhumans. We haven’t completely solved the mystery\nof why they disappeared, except to discover that they aren’t totally gone. They live on inside us, the only humans left. But the 7 and a half billion of us alive today\nshare more than these distant ancestors. We’re a lot more related than you think,\nand we’ll talk about that next time. Stay curious. Thanks to 23andme for sponsoring this episode. The name ‘23andMe’ comes from the fact that human DNA is organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes. 23andMe is a personal genetic analysis company created to help people understand their DNA. You can see which regions around the world your ancestors come from, learn how DNA impacts your health, your facial features, hair, even your sense of smell, and how you sleep. You just have to provide a DNA sample by spitting in a tube. I learned that I carry a gene that allows me to smell asparagus odor in my pee, and that I’m likely to have a longer second toe than big toe. Which is true. I have really long toes. But I also learned that one gene I inherited from my Neanderthal ancestors might be a reason I’m taller than most people. You can learn more about your personal DNA story and support our show by going to 23andMe.com/OKAY I studied genetics for my PhD, and learning about my DNA was just… so fun. Let us know if you give it a try. See you next week. This video is part of our special series  about the story\nof our species: Where we came from, how we’re all connected, and where we’re going.

Until, that is, the professor accidentally\nstepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through\nthe portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, \nthe portal will close, and your only way back will be \nto create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is\ncreated with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that\nwill take you back to the present. But the color of each individual\nconnection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose\nor change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a\ntemporal instability that raises the chances the portal\nmight collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules \nyou need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or \nblue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire\nbranch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some\nfamously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example,\nyou might have two blue and one red connection,\nand be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough?\nNo - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of\nconnections that avoids creating \na blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because\nthey don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a\nblue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without\nsorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect\nto the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue\nconnections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least\nthree connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules\non the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between\nthose three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections\nbetween them were red. But those three red connections\nwould give us a red triangle. No matter what happens,\nwe’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections \nwere all red instead of blue, the same argument still works, \nwith all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the\nconnections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or \nblue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through\nthe portal. You were hoping your internship would\ngive you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What happened to the professor?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He stepped through a time portal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He was hit by a ray gun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He was captured by aliens"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nothing.

First performed in the 1590's, this play is one of Shakespeare’s \nfriskiest works, filled with trickery, madness and magic. Set over the course of one night, Midsummer progresses at a rollicking pace. The plot is structured around patterns of \ncollision and dissolution, where characters from different worlds \nare thrown together and torn apart. Shakespeare uses these patterns to mock \nthe characters’ self-obsession and question authority with a comic twist. The action is set in Ancient Greece, but like many of Shakespeare’s plays \nit reflects his contemporary concerns. The magical setting of the woods at night disrupts the boundaries between \nseparate groups, with bizarre results. Here, the bard plays with the rigid class \nsystem of his own time, taking three distinct groups\nand turning their society upside-down in a world where no mortal is in control. The play opens with young Hermia raging at her father Egeus and \nTheseus, the King of Athens, who have forbidden her to marry \nher lover Lysander. Hermia has no interest in her father's \nchoice for her of Demetrius – but her best friend Helena \ndefinitely does. Furious at their elders, Hermia and \nLysander elope under cover of darkness, with Demetrius in hot pursuit. This is further complicated \nby Helena’s decision to follow them all into the woods,\nin the hope of winning Demetrius’ heart. At this point, the woods are \ngetting crowded, as the lovers are sharing the space \nwith a group of “rude mechanicals”— a troupe of workers drunkenly rehearsing \na play, led by the jovial Nick Bottom. Unbeknownst to them, the humans have \nentered into the world of the fairies. Despite their magical splendor, \nOberon and Titania, the king and queen of the fairies, \nhave their own romantic problems. Furious at his inability to control \nTitania, the jealous Oberon commands the trickster Puck to squeeze the\njuice of a magical flower over her eyes. When she wakes up, she’ll fall in love \nwith the first thing she sees. On his mission, Puck gleefully sprinkles the juice over\nthe eyes of the napping Demetrius and Lysander, and transforms Bottom’s head\ninto that of a donkey for good measure. As eyes flicker open, a night of chaos commences that includes\nbroken hearts, mistaken identity, and transformations. Out of all the characters, Bottom probably\nfares the best – when the bewitched Titania \nlays eyes on him, she calls on her fairies to lavish him \nwith wine and treasures and sweeps the transfigured donkeyman \noff his feet: “pluck the wings from painted butterflies/ To fan the moonbeams \nfrom his sleeping eyes. Nod to him, elves, \nand do him courtesies.” While magic is the catalyst to the action, the play reflects the real drama \nof the things we do for love – and the nonsensical behavior \nof the people under its spell. The moon overlooks the action \n“like a silver bow,” signifying erratic behavior, \nthe dark side of love, and the bewitching allure of a world \nwhere the usual rules don’t apply. Although the characters eventually \ncome to their senses, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" \nraises the question of how much agency we have \nover our own daily lives. But it’s not the more realistically\nrendered lovers, rulers or workers who have the last word, but the impish Puck who queries whether we\ncan ever truly trust what we see: If we shadows have offended, Think but this and all is mended: That you have but slumbered here While these visions did appear.  And in so doing, he evokes the effect of entering into the \nmagical world of great theatre that plays with the boundary between \nillusion and reality – and dramatizes the possibility \nthat life is but a dream."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where is a Midsummer Night's Dream set?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mantua"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ancient Rome"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ancient Greece"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Elizabethan England"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How does the play open?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Puck playing tricks on the king"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hermia refusing to marry Demetrius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Helena marrying Theseus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Oberon and Titania arguing"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why are the workers in the woods?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Planning a wedding"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Looking for magic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rehearsing a play"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Looking for love"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is Bottom partially transformed into?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Donkey"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fairy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "King"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cat"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who is the character with the last word in the play?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Demetrius"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Titania"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oberon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Puck"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

He knows the aliens are coming because\nhe has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience\nevents out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s \nSlaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood\ntrip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured\nas a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and \nmuch of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own \nexperiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former\nslaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an \nunderground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners\nfinally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to \nmake sense of human behavior by studying an unusual \naspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting\nas the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main \ncharacter’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed \ncommon types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be\nthe most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the \ncharacter’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story \nwas the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims \nof a series of accidents, unable to predict how events \nwill impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of \nmany stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune\nin his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned\nstraightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from \nbeginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future \nalways have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up\nin many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been\nand where it is going, so that the heavens are filled\nwith rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change \nthe course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace \nwith their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are \nstill getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life\nin the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics, \nlow comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within \na “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating \nfutures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers \navailable, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love\nwhoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters \nturn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies \nthat all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by \nthese tenets anyway, and in so doing develop\nsome genuine hope. They join together in groups called \nKarasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […] \nstick with by choice”— cosmically linked around\na shared purpose. These are not to be confused \nwith Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance\nto actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political \nparties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human \ncondition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get\nthrough this thing, whatever it is.\" We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed \nhis grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout, \nsupplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the\npossible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated \nin their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing \nthat they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re\nall here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about \nthe course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, \nhowever slim, that we might end up \nmaking something good.

But there’s a problem – the elder giant’s favorite \nshirt is wrinkled! To fix it, you’ll need to power up… the Giant Iron. The iron needs two giant \nbatteries to work. You just had 4 working ones and 4 dead ones in separate piles, but it looks like the baby giant \nmixed them all up. You need to get the iron working \nand press the giant shirt, fast – or you’ll end up being the \nmain course tonight! How can you test the batteries so that you’re guaranteed to get \na working pair in 7 tries or less? Pause the video now if you want to \nfigure it out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could, of course, take \nall eight batteries and begin testing the 28 \npossible combinations. You might get lucky within \nthe first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant \nbatteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst \npossibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need \nto test every possible combination. Remember – there are four \ngood batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two \ngood batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could \nstill take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you \na clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller \nsubsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three \npossible combinations. Since both batteries have to be \nworking for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether \nboth batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either \none good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for \nanother three batteries. You might get a match, but if every \ncombination fails again, you’ll know this set can have \nno more than one good battery. That would leave only two \nbatteries untried. Since there are four good \nbatteries in total and you’ve only accounted for two so far, both of these remaining ones must be good. Dividing the batteries into \nsets of 3, 3, and 2 is guaranteed to get a working result \nin 7 tries or less, no matter what order \nyou test the piles in.

So exactly where, when, and why did warm-hearted\nwolves join our pack? And who trained who? [OPEN] So… Cat person? Or dog person? Me? I’m totally impartial. No matter where you sit – siiiiiiit, it’s\nplain to see that the histories of dogs and humans are intertwined… maybe like no other\ntwo species. If we take domestication out of the human\nequation, it’s estimated just 1 or 2 million of us would be around today. And of all those animal alliances, our relationship\nwith dogs is the oldest. But figuring out why, where, and when domestic\ndogs first originated is still a bone of contention. Why? Is the easiest to answer. Every continent is home to wild canids – like\nAfrica’s painted dogs or Asia’s doles, but thanks to genetic research we know modern\npups didn’t descend from those local species. Today’s domestic dogs all trace their\nDNA back to ancient wolves. You may have heard that wolves and ancient\npeople were hunting buddies that used teamwork to run down bigger prey. That’s a nice story, but wolf packs can\nhunt just fine on their own – and usually aren’t too big on sharing. Plus, early humans tended to kill off most\ncarnivorous competition. It’s most likely that humans didn’t adopt\ndogs. Dogs adopted us. Any “wolves gone mild” that were tolerant\nof humans could have scrounged our scraps. They didn’t need us, but our leftovers could\nhave made their lives easier. Today, about 85 percent of domestic dogs still\nsurvive on our waste - no matter how many times we tell them “STAY OUT OF THE TRASH” But a tame wolf isn’t a dog, and scientists\nare still trying to figure out when and where that change occurred. Studying living wolves tells us the line that\nled to our pups is extinct today, but we can still find their footprints in modern dog\ngenomes. Looking at DNA in mitochondria tells us dogs\nsplit from their wolf ancestors somewhere in Europe between 19 and 32 thousand years\nago, but whole genomes from dozens of living dogs put the split somewhere in South Asia\naround 33,000 years ago. It’s tough to pin down because dog genes\nhave mixed so much. Fossils don’t tell the whole story either,\nbecause bones alone can’t tell us when the thing that looked like a wolf started to act\nlike a dog. But combining the two, fossils and DNA, could give us some hints. DNA extracted from ancient dog fossils has\nsuggested a new story: the domestication split happened in two places, at least 12,000 years\nago. And then at some point, Eastern dogs followed\npeople west, and became the dominant ancestor of our canine compadres. Dogs became useful herders, sled pullers,\nand guards – against predators AND neighboring human tribes. And in a pinch, they could have served as\nan emergency food supply. Dogs probably saved us more times than we\ncan count. We’re paying them back – pups now have\naccess to insurance, healthcare, some even have more instagram followers than you and\nme. From a wolf mold, we’ve crafted 340 or so\ndog breeds, even a few weird ones. It’s hard to believe every domestic dog\nis still part of the same species, one whose story is so tightly wound to our own, that\nwe still can’t quite tell where it begins. Stay! Staaaay.

I make things like neural networks\nthat predict the results of elections based on weather reports, because I'm intrigued about what the actual possibilities\nof these weird new technologies are. Last year, I built\nmy own self-driving car. But because I don't\nreally trust technology, I also designed a trap for it. (Laughter) And I do these things mostly because\nI find them completely fascinating, but also because I think\nwhen we talk about technology, we're largely talking about ourselves and the way that we understand the world. So here's a story about technology. This is a \"surprise egg\" video. It's basically a video of someone\nopening up loads of chocolate eggs and showing the toys inside to the viewer. That's it. That's all it does\nfor seven long minutes. And I want you to notice\ntwo things about this. First of all, this video\nhas 30 million views. (Laughter) And the other thing is, it comes from a channel\nthat has 6.3 million subscribers, that has a total of eight billion views, and it's all just more videos like this -- 30 million people watching a guy\nopening up these eggs. It sounds pretty weird, but if you search\nfor \"surprise eggs\" on YouTube, it'll tell you there's\n10 million of these videos, and I think that's an undercount. I think there's way, way more of these. If you keep searching, they're endless. There's millions and millions\nof these videos in increasingly baroque combinations\nof brands and materials, and there's more and more of them\nbeing uploaded every single day. Like, this is a strange world. Right? But the thing is, it's not adults\nwho are watching these videos. It's kids, small children. These videos are\nlike crack for little kids. There's something about the repetition, the constant little\ndopamine hit of the reveal, that completely hooks them in. And little kids watch these videos\nover and over and over again, and they do it for hours\nand hours and hours. And if you try and take\nthe screen away from them, they'll scream and scream and scream. If you don't believe me -- and I've already seen people\nin the audience nodding -- if you don't believe me, find someone\nwith small children and ask them, and they'll know about\nthe surprise egg videos. So this is where we start. It's 2018, and someone, or lots of people, are using the same mechanism that, like,\nFacebook and Instagram are using to get you to keep checking that app, and they're using it on YouTube\nto hack the brains of very small children in return for advertising revenue. At least, I hope\nthat's what they're doing. I hope that's what they're doing it for, because there's easier ways\nof making ad revenue on YouTube. You can just make stuff up or steal stuff. So if you search for really\npopular kids' cartoons like \"Peppa Pig\" or \"Paw Patrol,\" you'll find there's millions and millions\nof these online as well. Of course, most of them aren't posted\nby the original content creators. They come from loads and loads\nof different random accounts, and it's impossible to know\nwho's posting them or what their motives might be. Does that sound kind of familiar? Because it's exactly the same mechanism that's happening across most\nof our digital services, where it's impossible to know\nwhere this information is coming from. It's basically fake news for kids, and we're training them from birth to click on the very first link\nthat comes along, regardless of what the source is. That's doesn't seem like\na terribly good idea. Here's another thing\nthat's really big on kids' YouTube. This is called the \"Finger Family Song.\" I just heard someone groan\nin the audience. This is the \"Finger Family Song.\" This is the very first one I could find. It's from 2007, and it only has\n200,000 views, which is, like, nothing in this game. But it has this insanely earwormy tune, which I'm not going to play to you, because it will sear itself\ninto your brain in the same way that\nit seared itself into mine, and I'm not going to do that to you. But like the surprise eggs, it's got inside kids' heads and addicted them to it. So within a few years,\nthese finger family videos start appearing everywhere, and you get versions\nin different languages with popular kids' cartoons using food or, frankly, using whatever kind\nof animation elements you seem to have lying around. And once again, there are millions\nand millions and millions of these videos available online in all of these\nkind of insane combinations. And the more time\nyou start to spend with them, the crazier and crazier\nyou start to feel that you might be. And that's where I\nkind of launched into this, that feeling of deep strangeness\nand deep lack of understanding of how this thing was constructed\nthat seems to be presented around me. Because it's impossible to know\nwhere these things are coming from. Like, who is making them? Some of them appear to be made\nof teams of professional animators. Some of them are just randomly\nassembled by software. Some of them are quite wholesome-looking\nyoung kids' entertainers. And some of them are from people who really clearly\nshouldn't be around children at all. (Laughter) And once again, this impossibility\nof figuring out who's making this stuff -- like, this is a bot? Is this a person? Is this a troll? What does it mean\nthat we can't tell the difference between these things anymore? And again, doesn't that uncertainty\nfeel kind of familiar right now? So the main way people get views\non their videos -- and remember, views mean money -- is that they stuff the titles\nof these videos with these popular terms. So you take, like, \"surprise eggs\" and then you add\n\"Paw Patrol,\" \"Easter egg,\" or whatever these things are, all of these words from other\npopular videos into your title, until you end up with this kind of\nmeaningless mash of language that doesn't make sense to humans at all. Because of course it's only really\ntiny kids who are watching your video, and what the hell do they know? Your real audience\nfor this stuff is software. It's the algorithms. It's the software that YouTube uses to select which videos\nare like other videos, to make them popular,\nto make them recommended. And that's why you end up with this\nkind of completely meaningless mash, both of title and of content. But the thing is, you have to remember, there really are still people within\nthis algorithmically optimized system, people who are kind\nof increasingly forced to act out these increasingly bizarre\ncombinations of words, like a desperate improvisation artist\nresponding to the combined screams of a million toddlers at once. There are real people\ntrapped within these systems, and that's the other deeply strange thing\nabout this algorithmically driven culture, because even if you're human, you have to end up behaving like a machine just to survive. And also, on the other side of the screen, there still are these little kids\nwatching this stuff, stuck, their full attention grabbed\nby these weird mechanisms. And most of these kids are too small\nto even use a website. They're just kind of hammering\non the screen with their little hands. And so there's autoplay, where it just keeps playing these videos\nover and over and over in a loop, endlessly for hours and hours at a time. And there's so much weirdness\nin the system now that autoplay takes you\nto some pretty strange places. This is how, within a dozen steps, you can go from a cute video\nof a counting train to masturbating Mickey Mouse. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. This does get worse. This is what happens when all of these different keywords, all these different pieces of attention, this desperate generation of content, all comes together into a single place. This is where all those deeply weird\nkeywords come home to roost. You cross-breed the finger family video with some live-action superhero stuff, you add in some weird,\ntrollish in-jokes or something, and suddenly, you come\nto a very weird place indeed. The stuff that tends to upset parents is the stuff that has kind of violent\nor sexual content, right? Children's cartoons getting assaulted, getting killed, weird pranks that actually\ngenuinely terrify children. What you have is software pulling in\nall of these different influences to automatically generate\nkids' worst nightmares. And this stuff really, really\ndoes affect small children. Parents report their children\nbeing traumatized, becoming afraid of the dark, becoming afraid of their favorite\ncartoon characters. If you take one thing away from this,\nit's that if you have small children, keep them the hell away from YouTube. (Applause) But the other thing, the thing\nthat really gets to me about this, is that I'm not sure we even really\nunderstand how we got to this point. We've taken all of this influence,\nall of these things, and munged them together in a way\nthat no one really intended. And yet, this is also the way\nthat we're building the entire world. We're taking all of this data, a lot of it bad data, a lot of historical data\nfull of prejudice, full of all of our worst\nimpulses of history, and we're building that\ninto huge data sets and then we're automating it. And we're munging it together\ninto things like credit reports, into insurance premiums, into things like predictive\npolicing systems, into sentencing guidelines. This is the way we're actually\nconstructing the world today out of this data. And I don't know what's worse, that we built a system\nthat seems to be entirely optimized for the absolute worst aspects\nof human behavior, or that we seem\nto have done it by accident, without even realizing\nthat we were doing it, because we didn't really understand\nthe systems that we were building, and we didn't really understand\nhow to do anything differently with it. There's a couple of things I think\nthat really seem to be driving this most fully on YouTube, and the first of those is advertising, which is the monetization of attention without any real other variables at work, any care for the people who are\nactually developing this content, the centralization of the power,\nthe separation of those things. And I think however you feel\nabout the use of advertising to kind of support stuff, the sight of grown men in diapers\nrolling around in the sand in the hope that an algorithm\nthat they don't really understand will give them money for it suggests that this\nprobably isn't the thing that we should be basing\nour society and culture upon, and the way in which\nwe should be funding it. And the other thing that's kind of\nthe major driver of this is automation, which is the deployment\nof all of this technology as soon as it arrives,\nwithout any kind of oversight, and then once it's out there, kind of throwing up our hands and going,\n\"Hey, it's not us, it's the technology.\" Like, \"We're not involved in it.\" That's not really good enough, because this stuff isn't\njust algorithmically governed, it's also algorithmically policed. When YouTube first started\nto pay attention to this, the first thing they said\nthey'd do about it was that they'd deploy\nbetter machine learning algorithms to moderate the content. Well, machine learning,\nas any expert in it will tell you, is basically what we've started to call software that we don't really\nunderstand how it works. And I think we have\nenough of that already. We shouldn't be leaving\nthis stuff up to AI to decide what's appropriate or not, because we know what happens. It'll start censoring other things. It'll start censoring queer content. It'll start censoring\nlegitimate public speech. What's allowed in these discourses, it shouldn't be something\nthat's left up to unaccountable systems. It's part of a discussion\nall of us should be having. But I'd leave a reminder that the alternative isn't\nvery pleasant, either. YouTube also announced recently that they're going to release\na version of their kids' app that would be entirely\nmoderated by humans. Facebook -- Zuckerberg said\nmuch the same thing at Congress, when pressed about how they\nwere going to moderate their stuff. He said they'd have humans doing it. And what that really means is, instead of having toddlers being\nthe first person to see this stuff, you're going to have underpaid,\nprecarious contract workers without proper mental health support being damaged by it as well. (Laughter) And I think we can all do\nquite a lot better than that. (Applause) The thought, I think, that brings those\ntwo things together, really, for me, is agency. It's like, how much do we really\nunderstand -- by agency, I mean: how we know how to act\nin our own best interests. Which -- it's almost impossible to do in these systems that we don't\nreally fully understand. Inequality of power\nalways leads to violence. And we can see inside these systems that inequality of understanding\ndoes the same thing. If there's one thing that we can do\nto start to improve these systems, it's to make them more legible\nto the people who use them, so that all of us have\na common understanding of what's actually going on here. The thing, though, I think\nmost about these systems is that this isn't, as I hope\nI've explained, really about YouTube. It's about everything. These issues of accountability and agency, of opacity and complexity, of the violence and exploitation\nthat inherently results from the concentration\nof power in a few hands -- these are much, much larger issues. And they're issues not just of YouTube\nand not just of technology in general, and they're not even new. They've been with us for ages. But we finally built this system,\nthis global system, the internet, that's actually showing them to us\nin this extraordinary way, making them undeniable. Technology has this extraordinary capacity to both instantiate and continue all of our most extraordinary,\noften hidden desires and biases and encoding them into the world, but it also writes them down\nso that we can see them, so that we can't pretend\nthey don't exist anymore. We need to stop thinking about technology\nas a solution to all of our problems, but think of it as a guide\nto what those problems actually are, so we can start thinking\nabout them properly and start to address them. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: James, thank you\nfor coming and giving us that talk. So it's interesting: when you think about the films where\nthe robotic overlords take over, it's all a bit more glamorous\nthan what you're describing. But I wonder -- in those films,\nyou have the resistance mounting. Is there a resistance mounting\ntowards this stuff? Do you see any positive signs,\ngreen shoots of resistance? James Bridle: I don't know\nabout direct resistance, because I think this stuff\nis super long-term. I think it's baked into culture\nin really deep ways. A friend of mine,\nEleanor Saitta, always says that any technological problems\nof sufficient scale and scope are political problems first of all. So all of these things we're working\nto address within this are not going to be addressed\njust by building the technology better, but actually by changing the society\nthat's producing these technologies. So no, right now, I think we've got\na hell of a long way to go. But as I said, I think by unpacking them, by explaining them, by talking\nabout them super honestly, we can actually start\nto at least begin that process. HW: And so when you talk about\nlegibility and digital literacy, I find it difficult to imagine that we need to place the burden\nof digital literacy on users themselves. But whose responsibility\nis education in this new world? JB: Again, I think this responsibility\nis kind of up to all of us, that everything we do,\neverything we build, everything we make, needs to be made\nin a consensual discussion with everyone who's avoiding it; that we're not building systems\nintended to trick and surprise people into doing the right thing, but that they're actually involved\nin every step in educating them, because each of these systems\nis educational. That's what I'm hopeful about,\nabout even this really grim stuff, that if you can take it\nand look at it properly, it's actually in itself\na piece of education that allows you to start seeing\nhow complex systems come together and work and maybe be able to apply\nthat knowledge elsewhere in the world. HW: James, it's such\nan important discussion, and I know many people here\nare really open and prepared to have it, so thanks for starting off our morning. JB: Thanks very much. Cheers.

This happens after millions of years \nof heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium,\ncarbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient \nenergy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational \npressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its \ninnards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves\nbehind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that \natomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits \ninto the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star \nis the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects \nin the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics \nof supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which \nprotons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid \ncalled a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a \nfully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest \nin a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron \nsuperfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna \nto spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to \nneutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of \nkilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are\nonly about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular \nmomentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure \nskater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more \nrapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record \nrotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface \nwhirls through space at more than a fifth \nof the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest \nmagnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration\nforms vortexes that radiate beams \nfrom the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned \nwith the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink \nwhen viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these \ntantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly\ndiscovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation\nslows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form\nof electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars \ndisappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star \nco-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on \na lighter companion, gorging on its more \nloosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing\ncataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up \nas neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other \nin a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send \ngravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone \nthrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years\nago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories \nLIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of \ngamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, \nall from the same impact. That became the most studied event \nin the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed \nof gravity, bolster important theories \nin astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin \nof heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up \nall their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded \nto detect more collisions. That’ll help us learn what else the spectacular demise of these dense, \npulsating, spinning magnets can tell us about the universe.
