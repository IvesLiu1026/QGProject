Farmers reported feverish hogs with \ninflamed eyes and running snouts. But while fair officials worried \nabout the pigs, the Maryland department of health was \nconcerned about a group of sick fairgoers. Some had pet the pigs, while others had \nmerely been near their barns; but soon, 40 of these attendees would \nbe diagnosed with swine flu. More often than not, sick animals \ndon’t infect humans. But when they do, these \ncross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce \ndeadly epidemics. So how can pathogens from one species \ninfect another, and what makes host jumps so dangerous? Viruses are a type of organic parasite \ninfecting nearly all forms of life. To survive and reproduce, they must move\nthrough three stages: contact with a susceptible host, \ninfection and replication, and transmission to other individuals. As an example, let’s look \nat human influenza. First, the flu virus encounters \na new host and makes its way into \ntheir respiratory tract. This isn’t so difficult, but to survive \nin this new body, the virus must mount a successful \ninfection before it’s caught and broken down \nby an immune response. To accomplish this task, viruses have evolved specific interactions\nwith their host species. Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors \non human respiratory cells. Once inside a cell, the virus employs \nadditional adaptations to hijack the host cell’s reproductive \nmachinery and replicate its own genetic material. Now the virus only needs to suppress\nor evade the host’s immune system long enough to replicate to sufficient \nlevels and infect more cells. At this point, the flu can be passed on to\nits next victim via any transmission \nof infected bodily fluid. However, this simple sneeze also brings \nthe virus in contact with pets, plants, or even your lunch. Viruses are constantly encountering \nnew species and attempting to infect them. More often than not, this ends in failure. In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity \nbetween the two hosts is too great. For a virus adapted to infect humans, a lettuce cell would be a foreign and \ninhospitable landscape. But there are a staggering number \nof viruses circulating in the environment, all with the potential to \nencounter new hosts. And because viruses rapidly reproduce \nby the millions, they can quickly develop random mutations. Most mutations will have no effect, \nor even prove detrimental; but a small proportion may enable the \npathogen to better infect a new species. The odds of winning this destructive \ngenetic lottery increase over time, or if the new species is closely related \nto the virus’ usual host. For a virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take \na few lucky mutations. And a virus adapted to chimpanzees, one of our closest genetic relatives,\nmight barely require any changes at all. It takes more than time and genetic \nsimilarity for a host jump to be successful. Some viruses come equipped to easily \ninfect a new host’s cells, but are then unable to evade \nan immune response. Others might have a difficult time \ntransmitting to new hosts. For example, they might make the host’s \nblood contagious, but not their saliva. However, once a host jump reaches \nthe transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous. Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of \nmutating into a more successful virus. And each new host increases \nthe potential for a full-blown epidemic. Virologists are constantly looking for \nmutations that might make viruses such as influenza\nmore likely to jump. However, predicting the next potential \nepidemic is a major challenge. There’s a huge diversity of viruses \nthat we’re only just beginning to uncover. Researchers are tirelessly studying the \nbiology of these pathogens. And by monitoring populations to quickly\nidentify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment\nprotocols to stop these deadly diseases."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which species would we expect pathogens to be most likely to jump between?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Distantly related species, in the same environment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Closely related species, in the same environment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Closely related species, in different environments"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Distantly related species, in different environments"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Given equal exposure, which species might we expect to be the greatest source of emerging infectious diseases in humans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chimpanzees"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dogs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cats"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Daffodils"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When a virus mutates this:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Helps the virus adapt to a new host"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Can have no effect, be detrimental, or can be beneficial and help the virus adapt to its new host"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Causes an outbreak"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does a virus need to bind to before it can enter host cells?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Host receptors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Immune cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Host DNA"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where are viruses found?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mostly in primates"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mostly in humans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In almost every form of life"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 19, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why we get mad— and why it’s healthy - Ryan Martin", "category": "Emotional Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/1dL5z1gd", "transcript": {"en": "Alright, so I want you to imagine that you\nget a text from a friend, and it reads ... \"You will NOT believe what just happened.\nI'm SO MAD right now!\" So you do the dutiful thing as a friend,\nand you ask for details. And they tell you a story\nabout what happened to them at the gym or at work\nor on their date last night. And you listen and you try\nto understand why they're so mad. Maybe even secretly judge\nwhether or not they should be so mad. (Laughter) And maybe you even offer some suggestions. Now, in that moment, you are doing\nessentially what I get to do every day, because I'm an anger researcher, and as an anger researcher, I spend\na good part of my professional life -- who am I kidding, also my personal life -- studying why people get mad. I study the types of thoughts\nthey have when they get mad, and I even study what they do\nwhen they get mad, whether it's getting into fights\nor breaking things, or even yelling at people\nin all caps on the internet. (Laughter) And as you can imagine, when people hear I'm an anger researcher, they want to talk to me about their anger, they want to share with me\ntheir anger stories. And it's not because\nthey need a therapist, though that does sometimes happen, it's really because anger is universal. It's something we all feel\nand it's something they can relate to. We've been feeling it\nsince the first few months of life, when we didn't get what we wanted\nin our cries of protests, things like, \"What do you mean\nyou won't pick up the rattle, Dad, I want it!\" (Laughter) We feel it throughout our teenage years,\nas my mom can certainly attest to with me. Sorry, Mom. We feel it to the very end. In fact, anger has been with us\nat some of the worst moments of our lives. It's a natural and expected\npart of our grief. But it's also been with us\nin some of the best moments of our lives, with those special occasions\nlike weddings and vacations often marred by these everyday\nfrustrations -- bad weather, travel delays -- that feel horrible in the moment, but then are ultimately forgotten\nwhen things go OK. I have a lot of conversations\nwith people about their anger and it's through those conversations\nthat I've learned that many people, and I bet many people\nin this room right now, you see anger as a problem. You see the way\nit interferes in your life, the way it damages relationships,\nmaybe even the ways it's scary. And while I get all of that,\nI see anger a little differently, and today, I want to tell you\nsomething really important about your anger, and it's this: anger is a powerful and healthy\nforce in your life. It's good that you feel it. You need to feel it. But to understand all that,\nwe actually have to back up and talk about why we get mad\nin the first place. A lot of this goes back to the work\nof an anger researcher named Dr. Jerry Deffenbacher,\nwho wrote about this back in 1996 in a book chapter on how to deal\nwith problematic anger. Now, for most of us,\nand I bet most of you, it feels as simple as this: I get mad when I'm provoked. You hear it in the language people use. They say things like, \"It makes me so mad\nwhen people drive this slow,\" or, \"I got mad because she left\nthe milk out again.\" Or my favorite, \"I don't have an anger problem --\npeople just need to stop messing with me.\" (Laughter) Now, in the spirit of better understanding\nthose types of provocations, I ask a lot of people, including\nmy friends and colleagues and even family, \"What are the things\nthat really get to you? What makes you mad?\" By the way, now is a good time\nto point out one of the advantages of being an anger researcher is that I've spent more than a decade\ngenerating a comprehensive list of all the things\nthat really irritate my colleagues. Just in case I need it. (Laughter) But their answers are fascinating, because they say things like, \"when my sports team loses,\" \"people who chew too loudly.\" That is surprisingly common, by the way. \"People who walk too slowly,\"\nthat one's mine. And of course, \"roundabouts.\" Roundabouts -- (Laughter) I can tell you honestly,\nthere is no rage like roundabout rage. (Laughter) Sometimes their answers\naren't minor at all. Sometimes they talk\nabout racism and sexism and bullying and environmental destruction --\nbig, global problems we all face. But sometimes, their answers are very specific,\nmaybe even oddly specific. \"That wet line you get across your shirt when you accidentally lean\nagainst the counter of a public bathroom.\" (Laughter) Super gross, right? (Laughter) Or \"Flash drives: there's only\ntwo ways to plug them in, so why does it always\ntake me three tries?\" (Laughter) Now whether it's minor or major,\nwhether it's general or specific, we can look at these examples and we can tease out some common themes. We get angry in situations\nthat are unpleasant, that feel unfair,\nwhere our goals are blocked, that could have been avoided,\nand that leave us feeling powerless. This is a recipe for anger. But you can also tell that anger is probably not the only thing\nwe're feeling in these situations. Anger doesn't happen in a vacuum. We can feel angry at the same time\nthat we're scared or sad, or feeling a host of other emotions. But here's the thing: these provocations --\nthey aren't making us mad. At least not on their own, and we know that, because if they were, we'd all get angry\nover the same things, and we don't. The reasons I get angry are different\nthan the reasons you get angry, so there's got to be\nsomething else going on. What is that something else? Well, we know what we're doing and feeling\nat the moment of that provocation matters. We call this the pre-anger state --\nare you hungry, are you tired, are you anxious about something else,\nare you running late for something? When you're feeling those things, those provocations feel that much worse. But what matters most\nis not the provocation, it's not the pre-anger state, it's this: it's how we interpret that provocation, it's how we make sense of it in our lives. When something happens to us, we first decide, is this good or bad? Is it fair or unfair,\nis it blameworthy, is it punishable? That's primary appraisal,\nit's when you evaluate the event itself. We decide what it means\nin the context of our lives and once we've done that,\nwe decide how bad it is. That's secondary appraisal. We say, \"Is this the worst thing\nthat's ever happened, or can I cope with this? Now, to illustrate that, I want you\nto imagine you are driving somewhere. And before I go any further,\nI should tell you, if I were an evil genius and I wanted to create a situation\nthat was going to make you mad, that situation would look\na lot like driving. (Laughter) It's true. You are, by definition,\non your way somewhere, so everything that happens -- traffic,\nother drivers, road construction -- it feels like it's blocking your goals. There are all these written\nand unwritten rules of the road, and those rules are routinely violated\nright in front of you, usually without consequence. And who's violating those rules? Anonymous others,\npeople you will never see again, making them a very easy target\nfor your wrath. (Laughter) So you're driving somewhere,\nthus teed up to be angry, and the person in front of you\nis driving well below the speed limit. And it's frustrating because you can't really see\nwhy they're driving so slow. That's primary appraisal. You've looked at this and you've said\nit's bad and it's blameworthy. But maybe you also decide\nit's not that big a deal. You're not in a hurry, doesn't matter. That's secondary appraisal --\nyou don't get angry. But now imagine you're on your way\nto a job interview. What that person is doing,\nit hasn't changed, right? So primary appraisal doesn't change;\nstill bad, still blameworthy. But your ability\nto cope with it sure does. Because all of a sudden, you're going to be late\nto that job interview. All of a sudden, you are not going to get your dream job, the one that was going to give you\npiles and piles of money. (Laughter) Somebody else is going to get\nyour dream job and you're going to be broke. You're going to be destitute. Might as well stop now, turn around,\nmove in with your parents. (Laughter) Why? \"Because of this person in front of me. This is not a person, this is a monster.\" (Laughter) And this monster is here\njust to ruin your life. (Laughter) Now that thought process, it's called catastrophizing,\nthe one where we make the worst of things. And it's one of the primary\ntypes of thoughts that we know is associated with chronic anger. But there's a couple of others. Misattributing causation. Angry people tend to put blame\nwhere it doesn't belong. Not just on people, but actually inanimate objects as well. And if you think that sound ridiculous, think about the last time\nyou lost your car keys and you said, \"Where did those car keys go?\" Because you know\nthey ran off on their own. (Laughter) They tend to overgeneralize,\nthey use words like \"always,\" \"never,\" \"every,\"\n\"this always happens to me,\" \"I never get what I want\" or \"I hit every stoplight\non the way here today.\" Demandingness: they put their own needs\nahead of the needs of others: \"I don't care why this person\nis driving so slow, they need to speed up or move over\nso I can get to this job interview.\" And finally, inflammatory labeling. They call people fools, idiots, monsters, or a whole bunch of things\nI've been told I'm not allowed to say during this TED Talk. (Laughter) So for a long time, psychologists have referred to these\nas cognitive distortions or even irrational beliefs. And yeah, sometimes they are irrational. Maybe even most of the time. But sometimes, these thoughts\nare totally rational. There is unfairness in the world. There are cruel, selfish people, and it's not only OK to be angry\nwhen we're treated poorly, it's right to be angry\nwhen we're treated poorly. If there's one thing I want you\nto remember from my talk today, it's this: your anger exists in you as an emotion because it offered your ancestors,\nboth human and nonhuman, with an evolutionary advantage. Just as your fear alerts you to danger, your anger alerts you to injustice. It's one of the ways your brain\ncommunicates to you that you have had enough. What's more, it energizes you\nto confront that injustice. Think for a second\nabout the last time you got mad. Your heart rate increased. Your breathing increased,\nyou started to sweat. That's your sympathetic nervous system, otherwise known\nas your fight-or-flight system, kicking in to offer you\nthe energy you need to respond. And that's just the stuff you noticed. At the same time, your digestive system\nslowed down so you could conserve energy. That's why your mouth went dry. And your blood vessels dilated\nto get blood to your extremities. That's why your face went red. It's all part of this complex pattern\nof physiological experiences that exist today because they helped your ancestors deal with cruel and unforgiving\nforces of nature. And the problem is that the thing\nyour ancestors did to deal with their anger, to physically fight, they are no longer reasonable\nor appropriate. You can't and you shouldn't swing a club\nevery time you're provoked. (Laughter) But here's the good news. You are capable of something your nonhuman ancestors\nweren't capable of. And that is the capacity\nto regulate your emotions. Even when you want to lash out, you can stop yourself\nand you can channel that anger into something more productive. So often when we talk about anger, we talk about how to keep\nfrom getting angry. We tell people to calm down or relax. We even tell people to let it go. And all of that assumes that anger is bad\nand that it's wrong to feel it. But instead, I like to think\nof anger as a motivator. The same way your thirst\nmotivates you to get a drink of water, the same way your hunger\nmotivates you to get a bite to eat, your anger can motivate you\nto respond to injustice. Because we don't have to think too hard\nto find things we should be mad about. When we go back to the beginning, yeah, some of those things, they're silly\nand not worth getting angry over. But racism, sexism, bullying,\nenvironmental destruction, those things are real,\nthose things are terrible, and the only way to fix them\nis to get mad first and then channel that anger\ninto fighting back. And you don't have to fight back\nwith aggression or hostility or violence. There are infinite ways\nthat you can express your anger. You can protest,\nyou can write letters to the editor, you can donate to\nand volunteer for causes, you can create art,\nyou can create literature, you can create poetry and music, you can create a community\nthat cares for one another and does not allow\nthose atrocities to happen. So the next time\nyou feel yourself getting angry, instead of trying to turn it off, I hope you'll listen\nto what that anger is telling you. And then I hope you'll channel it\ninto something positive and productive. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

This brown powder could be mixed \ninto drinks, made into salves or eaten straight up. It was known as mumia and made \nby grinding up mummified human flesh. The word \"cannibal\" dates from the \ntime of Christopher Columbus; in fact, Columbus may even have \ncoined it himself. After coming ashore on the \nisland of Guadaloupe, Columbus' initial reports back \nto the Queen of Spain described the indigenous people as \nfriendly and peaceful— though he did mention rumors of a \ngroup called the Caribs, who made violent raids and then cooked \nand ate their prisoners. In response, Queen Isabella granted \npermission to capture and enslave anyone who ate human flesh. When the island failed to produce the gold\nColumbus was looking for, he began to label anyone who resisted his \nplundering and kidnapping as a Caribe. Somewhere along the way, the word \"Carib\" \nbecame \"Canibe\" and then \"Cannibal.\" First used by colonizers to dehumanize \nindigenous people, it has since been applied to anyone \nwho eats human flesh. So the term comes from an account that \nwasn't based on hard evidence, but cannibalism does have a real and \nmuch more complex history. It has taken diverse forms— sometimes, \nas with mumia, it doesn't involved recognizable parts \nof the human body. The reasons for cannibalistic practices \nhave varied, too. Across cultures and time periods, there's \nevidence of survival cannibalism, when people living through a famine, \nsiege or ill-fated expedition had to either eat the bodies of the dead \nor starve to death themselves. But it's also been quite common \nfor cultures to normalize some form of eating human \nflesh under ordinary circumstances. Because of false accounts \nlike Columbus's, it's difficult to say exactly how common \ncultural cannibalism has been— but there are still some examples of \naccepted cannibalistic practices from within the cultures practicing them. Take the medicinal cannibalism in Europe \nduring Columbus's time. Starting in the 15th century, the demand \nfor mumia increased. At first, stolen mummies from Egypt \nsupplied the mumia craze, but soon the demand was too great to be \nsustained on Egyptian mummies alone, and opportunists stole bodies from \nEuropean cemeteries to turn into mumia. Use of mumia continued for \nhundreds of years. It was listed in the Merck index, \na popular medical encyclopedia, into the 20th century. And ground up mummies were far from \nthe only remedy made from human flesh that was common throughout Europe. Blood, in either liquid or powdered form, \nwas used to treat epilepsy, while human liver, gall stones, oil \ndistilled from human brains, and pulverized hearts were popular \nmedical concoctions. In China, the written record of socially accepted \ncannibalism goes back almost 2,000 years. One particularly common \nform of cannibalism appears to have been filial cannibalism, where adult sons and daughters would \noffer a piece of their own flesh to their parents. This was typically offered as a last-ditch\nattempt to cure a sick parent, and wasn't fatal to their offspring— it usually involved flesh from the thigh \nor, less often, a finger. Cannibalistic funerary rites are another \nform of culturally sanctioned cannibalism. Perhaps the best-known example came \nfrom the Fore people of New Guinea. Through the mid-20th century, members \nof the community would, if possible, make their funerary \npreferences known in advance, sometimes requesting that family members\ngather to consume the body after death. Tragically, though these rituals \nhonored the deceased, they also spread a deadly disease known \nas kuru through the community. Between the fictionalized stories, \nverifiable practices, and big gaps that still exist \nin our knowledge, there's no one history of cannibalism. But we do know that people have \nbeen eating each other, volunteering themselves to be eaten, and accusing others of eating \npeople for millennia."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Ground up mummy (mumia) was listed in the popular medical encyclopedia the Merck Index into the ______ century.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15th"}, {"label": "B", "text": "19th"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20th"}, {"label": "D", "text": "21st"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Medicinal cannibalism began in Europe in the _______ century.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "14th"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15th"}, {"label": "C", "text": "18th"}, {"label": "D", "text": "19th"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "After realizing that there wasn’t much _______ to be found, Columbus increased his efforts to exploit and enslave the native people of the Caribbean.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "silver"}, {"label": "B", "text": "gold"}, {"label": "C", "text": "oil"}, {"label": "D", "text": "timber"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "With examples in many countries, __________ cannibalism is associated with famines, strandings, or ill-fated expeditions.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "funerary"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ritual"}, {"label": "C", "text": "culinary"}, {"label": "D", "text": "survival"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "All of the following except _________ were used in European medicinal cannibalism.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "brains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "blood"}, {"label": "C", "text": "liver"}, {"label": "D", "text": "hearts"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above were used in medicinal cannibalism."}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

He went on to win the Nobel Prize \nin Literature— and also rescue 2,000 refugees, spend three years in political exile, and run for president of Chile. A romantic and a revolutionary, Neruda was one of the most celebrated \npoets of the 20th century, but also one of the most accessible and\ncontroversial. Originally written in Spanish, his poems often use straightforward \nlanguage and everyday experience to create lasting impact. Neruda was born Ricardo Eliezer Neftalí\nReyes Basoalto in a small Chilean town in 1904. His father didn’t want him to be a poet, so at sixteen he began to write under \nthe pen name “Pablo Neruda.” The poems in his early collection \"Twenty \nLove Poems and a Song of Despair\" were tender and perceptive, illuminating the subtleties \nof love and enchantment. In \"Poem VI,\" for example, he writes: “Tu recuerdo es de luz, de humo, de \nestanque en calma!/ Más allá de tus ojos ardían \nlos crepúsculos.” Later, he poured this attention to detail\ninto poems of appreciation for everyday objects. Many of the 225 short poems in his \ncollection \"All the Odes\" are dedicated to the assortment of small, apparently insignificant items \nthat surround us, from a pair of shoelaces to a watermelon. An onion is más hermosa que un ave/ de\nplumas cegadoras, while a tuna in the market is a bala \ndel profundo/ océano, proyectil natatorio, \nte vi, muerto. Despite this early literary success, Neruda struggled financially, and took a series of diplomatic jobs \nin places such as Burma, Indonesia, Singapore and Spain. In 1936, while Neruda was working at the\nconsulate in Madrid, civil war broke out and the government was overthrown \nby a fascist military dictatorship. Neruda organized an evacuation of \nrefugees from Spain to Chile, saving 2,000 lives. Over a period of twenty years, Neruda captured his experiences abroad in\na three volume poetry collection titled \"Residence on Earth.\" Many of these poems were experimental \nand surreal, merging epic landscapes, \nsupernatural themes, and feelings of longing with discussion\nof political strife and a poet’s responsibility to \nspeak out against injustice. In “I Explain a Few Things” he lingers on haunting details of the \ndestruction of the Spanish Civil War. For the rest of his life, Neruda remained committed to \nrevolutionary ideals. His politics led to several years of exile before he was able to return \nto Chile in 1952. While in exile, he published his influential \n\"Canto General.\" The book attempts to retell the entire \nhistory of Latin America through poetry, touching on everything \nfrom its flora and fauna to its politics and wars, but above all paying homage \nto the common people behind its civilizations’ achievements. Although he continued to travel, after returning from exile Neruda lived in Chile for the \nrest of his life. In 1970, at age 66, Neruda ran for president of Chile before\nyielding to Salvador Allende and becoming his close advisor. But in 1973, Allende was overthrown in a \nmilitary coup by General Augusto Pinochet. Neruda died in the hospital \na couple of weeks later. Because of the timing of his death \nso soon after the coup, rumors swirled that he had died of sadness\nor even been assassinated, but the hospital recorded his cause \nof death as cancer. Today, Neruda’s lines are recited at \nprotests and marches worldwide.

But more than all the words\nshe ever spoke, that single portrait of Septima Clark, it defined confidence for me before I ever even knew the word. It may sound simple, but confidence is something\nthat we underestimate the importance of. We treat it like a nice-to-have\ninstead of a must-have. We place value on knowledge and resources above what we deem to be\nthe soft skill of confidence. But by most measures,\nwe have more knowledge and more resources now\nthan at any other point in history, and still injustice abounds\nand challenges persist. If knowledge and resources\nwere all that we needed, we wouldn't still be here. And I believe that confidence\nis one of the main things missing from the equation. I'm completely obsessed with confidence. It's been the most important\njourney of my life, a journey that,\nto be honest, I'm still on. Confidence is the necessary spark\nbefore everything that follows. Confidence is the difference\nbetween being inspired and actually getting started, between trying and doing until it's done. Confidence helps us keep going\neven when we failed. The name of the book on that coffee table\nwas \"I Dream A World,\" and today I dream a world\nwhere revolutionary confidence helps bring about our\nmost ambitious dreams into reality. That's exactly the kind of world\nthat I wanted to create in my classroom when I was a teacher, like a Willy Wonka world\nof pure imagination, but make it scholarly. All of my students were black or brown. All of them were growing up\nin a low-income circumstance. Some of them were immigrants,\nsome of them were disabled, but all of them were the very last people this world invites to be confident. That's why it was so important\nthat my classroom be a place where my students could build\nthe muscle of confidence, where they could learn to face each day\nwith the confidence you need to redesign the world\nin the image of your own dreams. After all, what are academic skills\nwithout the confidence to use those skills to go out and change the world. Now is when I should tell you about\ntwo of my students, Jamal and Regina. Now, I've changed their names,\nbut their stories remain the same. Jamal was brilliant, but unfocused. He would squirm in his chair\nduring independent work, and he would never stay still\nfor more than three or four minutes. Students like Jamal\ncan perplex brand new teachers because they're not quite sure\nhow to support young people like him. I took a direct approach. I negotiated with Jamal. If he could give me focused work, then he could do it\nfrom anywhere in the classroom, from our classroom rug,\nfrom behind my desk, from inside his classroom locker,\nwhich turned out to be his favorite place. Jamal's least favorite\nsubject was writing, and he never wanted to read\nwhat he had written out loud in class, but we were still making progress. One day, I decided to host\na mock 2008 presidential election in my classroom. My third graders had to research\nand write a stump speech for their chosen candidate: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton\nor John McCain. The heavy favorites were obvious, but one student chose John McCain. It was Jamal. Jamal finally decided to read something\nthat he had written out loud in class, and sure enough, Jamal stunned\nall of us with his brilliance. Just like Jamal's dad,\nJohn McCain was a veteran, and just like Jamal's dad protected him, Jamal believed that John McCain\nwould protect the entire country. And he wasn't my candidate of choice,\nbut it didn't matter, because the entire class\nerupted into applause, a standing ovation\nfor our brave friend Jamal who finally showed up\nas his most confident self for the first time that year. And then there was Regina. Regina was equally\nas brilliant, but active. She'd inevitably finish her work early, and then she'd get on about the business\nof distracting other students. (Laughter) Walking, talking, passing those notes\nthat teachers hate but kids love. You look like you passed a lot of them. (Laughter) Despite my high ideals for our classroom, I would too often default\nto my baser instincts, and I would choose\ncompliance over confidence. Regina was a glitch in my intended system. A good teacher can correct misbehavior but still remain a student's champion. But on one day in particular, I just plain old chose control. I snapped, and my approach\ndidn't communicate to Regina that she was being a distraction. My approach communicated to Regina\nthat she herself was a distraction. I watched the light go out from her eyes, and that light sparked joy\nin our classroom. I had just extinguished it. The entire class became irritable, and we didn't recover\nfor the rest of the day. I think about the day often, and I have literally prayed\nthat I did not do irreparable harm, because as a woman who used to be\na little girl just like Regina, I know that I could have started\nthe process of killing her confidence forever. A lack of confidence\npulls us down from the bottom and weighs us down from the top, crushing us between a flurry\nof can'ts, won'ts and impossibles. Without confidence, we get stuck, and when we get stuck,\nwe can't even get started. Instead of getting mired\nin what can get in our way, confidence invites us\nto perform with certainty. We all operate a little differently\nwhen we're sure we can win versus if we just hope we will. Now, this can be a helpful check. If you don't have enough confidence, it could be because you need\nto readjust your goal. If you have too much confidence, it could be because\nyou're not rooted in something real. Not everyone lacks confidence. We make it easier in this society\nfor some people to gain confidence because they fit our preferred\narchetype of leadership. We reward confidence in some people and we punish confidence in others, and all the while far too many people are walking around\nevery single day without it. For some of us, confidence is a revolutionary choice, and it would be our greatest shame to see our best ideas go unrealized and our brightest dreams go unreached all because we lacked\nthe engine of confidence. That's not a risk I'm willing to take. So how do we crack the code on confidence? In my estimation,\nit takes at least three things: permission, community and curiosity. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it. In education, we've got a saying, that you can't be what you can't see. When I was a little girl,\nI couldn't show confidence until someone showed me. My family used to do everything together, including the mundane things,\nlike buying a new car, and every time we did this, I'd watch my parents\nput on the exact same performance. We'd enter the dealership, and my dad would sit while my mom shopped. When my mom found a car that she liked, they'd go in and meet with the dealer, and inevitably, every time\nthe dealer would turn his attention and his body to my dad, assuming that he\ncontrolled the purse strings and therefore this negotiation. \"Rev. Packnett,\" they'd say,\n\"how do we get you into this car today?\" My dad would inevitably\nrespond the same way. He'd slowly and silently\ngesture toward my mother and then put his hands\nright back in his lap. It might have been the complete shock of negotiating finances\nwith a black woman in the '80s, but whatever it was, I'd watch my mother\nwork these car dealers over until they were basically\ngiving the car away for free. (Laughter) She would never crack a smile. She would never be afraid to walk away. I know my mom just thought\nshe was getting a good deal on a minivan, but what she was actually doing was giving me permission\nto defy expectations and to show up confidently in my skill\nno matter who doubts me. Confidence needs permission to exist and community is the safest place\nto try confidence on. I traveled to Kenya this year\nto learn about women's empowerment among Maasai women. There I met a group of young women called Team Lioness, among Kenya's first all-female\ncommunity ranger groups. These eight brave young women\nwere making history in just their teenage years, and I asked Purity, the most verbose\nyoung ranger among them, \"Do you ever get scared?\" I swear to you, I want to tattoo\nher response all over my entire body. She said, \"Of course I do, but I call on my sisters. They remind me that we\nwill be better than these men and that we will not fail.\" Purity's confidence to chase down\nlions and catch poachers, it didn't come from her athletic ability\nor even just her faith. Her confidence was\npropped up by sisterhood, by community. What she was basically saying\nwas that if I am ever in doubt, I need you to be there to restore my hope and to rebuild my certainty. In community, I can find my confidence and your curiosity can affirm it. Early in my career,\nI led a large-scale event that did not go exactly as planned. I'm lying to you. It was terrible. And when I debriefed the event\nwith my manager, I just knew that she\nwas going to run down the list of every mistake I had ever made, probably from birth. But instead, she opened with a question: What was your intention? I was surprised but relieved. She knew that I was already\nbeating myself up, and that question invited me\nto learn from my own mistakes instead of damage\nmy already fragile confidence. Curiosity invites people\nto be in charge of their own learning. That exchange, it helped me\napproach my next project with the expectation of success. Permission, community, curiosity: all of these are the things that we\nwill need to breed the confidence that we'll absolutely need\nto solve our greatest challenges and to build the world we dream, a world where inequity is ended\nand where justice is real, a world where we can be free\non the outside and free on the inside because we know that none of us are free\nuntil all of us are free. A world that isn't\nintimidated by confidence when it shows up as a woman or in black skin or in anything other than\nour preferred archetypes of leadership. A world that knows\nthat that kind of confidence is exactly the key we need\nto unlock the future that we want. I have enough confidence\nto believe that that world will indeed come to pass, and that we are the ones to make it so. Thank you so much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But now, every species in the galaxy is \nin a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves. And right away, you’ve got a problem. Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive \nconsumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel. But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between \nthere and here. There’s one thing that can \nhelp you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space. That means you can vent a cache of it \nfrom your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick \nit up again later. Even though your ship holds \nonly 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units \nin your current location. With some strategic fuel caching \nalong the way, you might be able to \nmake it all 23 parsecs. So how can you reach the \nalien space station? Answer in 3, 2, 1. It’s possible to solve this riddle using \nas few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions \nthat use more. No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where \nto cache fuel along your route. Let’s work backwards from the \nalien space station. To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec \nmark with a full tank of fuel. The 8-parsec point is too far from the \nstart to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have \nenough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later. So that means you’ll need to find a cache \nsomewhere between the start and 8. But where? There’s an interesting pattern \nthat can help. At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’ \nworth of fuel. At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1. Is there a point, which we can call \npoint X, where you could have exactly 2? That would be useful, because then you \ncould refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity \nwithout any waste. Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec \ncache point, and a second time for good. So you’ll jump the distance between X and \n8-parsecs 3 times in all. You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and\nneed 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units-- \ngoing back and forth. Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points \n5 parsecs apart. Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough \nfuel to reach the alien space station. So it looks like the earliest we can place\npoint X is at the 3-parsec mark. Is it possible to transport 30 units of \nfuel there? Let’s try. You set out with a full tank of 15 units. You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units \noff at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, \narriving with an empty tank. Repeating this process gets you 18 units \nof fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec\ncache with 30 total units of fuel. So far so good! Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump \nback to the 3-parsec mark. You fill up your tank and \njump forward again, arriving with 10 units of \nfuel in your tank. And now the end is in sight. You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep \nspace to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of \nyour final destination. A 15-parsec jump leaves you \nrunning on fumes, but ready to dock with the \nprecursor space station. Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone \nin the galaxy."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following cache point(s) can get you to the alien ship?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Point 8 only"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Point 3 and 8"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Point 8 and 12"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Point 15 only"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many units of fuel can your ship hold?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15 Parsecs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "21 Parsecs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "23 parsecs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "45 Parsecs"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many trips can you make from cache point 3 to cache point 8?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 trips"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3 trips"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2 trip"}, {"label": "D", "text": "0 trips"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What characteristic about dark matter fuel makes you able to reach the abandoned alien space?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dark matter is stable in deep space"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dark matter has infinite power"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dark matter regenerates"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "True or false: Point 8 is the only cache point you need to reach the alien spaceship?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 19, "lesson": 7, "title": "Infinity according to Jorge Luis Borges - Ilan Stavans", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/infinity-according-to-jorge-luis-borges-ilan-stavans", "transcript": {"en": "When Ireneo Funes looked at a glass of \nwine on a table, he saw “all the shoots, clusters, and \ngrapes of the vine. He remembered the shapes of the clouds \nin the south at the dawn of the 30th of April of 1882, and he could compare them in his \nrecollection with the marbled grain in the design of a leather-bound book \nwhich he had seen only once, and with the lines in the spray \nwhich an oar raised in the Rio Negro on the eve of the \nbattle of the Quebrancho.” In the short story “Funes, the Memorious,” Jorge Luis Borges explores what it would \nbe like to have a perfect memory. His character not only remembers \neverything he has ever seen, but every time he has seen \nit in perfect detail. These details are so overwhelming Funes has to spend his days \nin a dark room, and can only sleep by imagining a part \nof town he has never visited. According to Borges, Funes’s memories even rendered him \nincapable of real thought, because “To think is to forget a \ndifference, to generalize, to abstract. In the overly replete world of Funes \nthere were nothing but details.” Funes’ limitless memory was just one \nof Borges’s many explorations of infinity. Born in Argentina in 1899, he admired the revolutionaries \nof his mother’s family but took after his father’s bookish clan. His body of essays, poems, and stories, \nor, as he called them, ficciones pioneered the literary style of \n“lo real maravilloso,” known in English as Magical Realism— and each was just a few pages long. Though Borges was not interested in \nwriting long books, he was an avid reader, recruiting friends to read to him \nafter he went blind in middle age. He said his image of paradise was an \ninfinite library, an idea he brought to life in \n“The library of Babel.” Built out of countless identical rooms, each containing the same number of \nbooks of the same length, the library of babel is its own universe. It contains every possible \nvariation of text, so there are some profound books, but also countless tomes \nof complete gibberish. The narrator has spent his entire life wandering this vast labyrinth \nof information in a possibly futile search for meaning. Labyrinths appeared over and over \nin Borges’ work. In “The Garden of Forking Paths,” as Yu Tsun winds his way through \ncountry roads, he remembers a lost labyrinth \nbuilt by one of his ancestors. Over the course of the story, he finds out the labyrinth is not a \nphysical maze but a novel. And this novel reveals that the real \nGarden of Forking Paths is time: in every instant, there are infinite \npossible courses of action. And as one moment follows another, each possibility begets another \nset of divergent futures. Borges laid out infinite expanses of time\nin his labyrinths, but he also explored the idea of \ncondensing all of time into a single moment. In “The God’s Script,” at the very beginning of the world the god writes exactly one message into the spots of the jaguars, who then “love and reproduce without end, in caverns, in cane fields, on islands, in order that the last men \nmight receive it.” The last man turns out to be a tenacious\nold priest who spends years memorizing and \ndeciphering the jaguar’s spots, culminating in an epiphany where he \nfinally understands the god’s message. Imprisoned deep underground, he has no one to share this meaning with, and it changes nothing \nabout his circumstances, but he doesn’t mind: in that one moment, he has experienced all the experience of\neveryone who has ever existed. Reading Borges, you might catch\na glimpse of infinity too."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How did Borges use labyrinths?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He was a free mason"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He liked to make people’s life difficult"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He argued that the world is ruled by a hidden order"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He believed in climate change"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why did he specialize in writing short pieces: essays, stories, and poems?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He thought people didn’t have time to read"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He was lazy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He believed in concision"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He didn’t like writing"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In what way did he understand the infinite?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As a sum of individualities"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The total number of stars in the firmament"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The ocean"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The speed of light"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In which language did Borges write?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Portugese"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Spanish"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hebrew"}, {"label": "D", "text": "English"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What did Borges equate thinking with?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fear"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Forgetting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Entrepreneurship"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Singing"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and \nthousands of grandchildren. They check in with their neighbors, \nsharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their long lives. They do all this rooted in place, unable \nto speak, reach out, or move around. The secret to their success lies \nunder the forest floor, where vast root systems support the \ntowering trunks above. Partnering with these roots are symbiotic \nfungi called mycorrhizae. These fungi have countless branching, \nthread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium. The mycelium spreads across a much larger \narea than the tree root system and connect the roots of different \ntrees together. These connections form \nmycorrhizal networks. Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling \nmolecules between trees. We know the oldest trees have the \nlargest mycorrhizal networks with the most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly \ncomplicated to trace. That’s because there are about a hundred \nspecies of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual tree might be colonized \nby dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a \nunique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique \nset of fungal associations. To get a sense of how substances flow \nthrough this network, let’s zoom in on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a \nneighboring seedling. Sugar’s journey starts high above \nthe ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees \nabove the canopy. The leaves use the ample sunlight up there\nto create sugars through photosynthesis. This essential fuel then travels \nthrough the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick sap. From there, sugar flows down to the roots. Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the \ntips of the roots and either surround or penetrate \nthe outer root cells, depending on the type of fungi. Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they \nneed them for fuel just like trees do. They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much \nmore efficiently than tree roots— and pass these nutrients into \nthe tree roots. In general, substances flow from where they are more \nabundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink. That means that the sugars flow from the \ntree roots into the fungal hyphae. Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through \npores between cells or through special hollow \ntransporter hyphae. The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and enters \nthe roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and \nhas less opportunity to photosynthesize sugars. But why does fungus transport resources \nfrom tree to tree? This is one of the mysteries of the \nmycorrhizal networks. It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil\nnutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit. The fungus likely benefits in less obvious\nways from being part of a network between trees, but the exact ways \naren’t totally clear. Maybe the fungus benefits from \nhaving connections with as many different trees as possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling\nmolecules between trees. Or maybe plants reduce their \ncontributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges \nbetween trees. Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount \nof information between trees. Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell \nwhen nutrients or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their \nown species or not. They can even tell when information is \ncoming from a close relative like a sibling or parent. Trees can also share information \nabout events like drought or insect attacks through their \nfungal networks, causing their neighbors to increase \nproduction of protective enzymes in anticipation of threats. The forest’s health relies on these \nintricate communications and exchanges. With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound \nto impact others."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What type of ecological relationships exists between plant fine roots and mycorrhizal fungi?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Predation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Symbiosis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Competition"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many fungal organisms can colonize a single plant?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less than 5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dozens"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What do mycorrhizal fungi collect from the soil and give the plants in exchange for sugars?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oxygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nutrients"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carbon dioxide"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Through mycorrhizal networks, what information can trees get about resources or signals they receive?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The size of the tree from which resources or signals are coming from."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The distance at which resources or signals are sent from"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whether resources or signal are coming from a family member"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What can a tree be warned about through mycorrhizal networks?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "About an insect attack"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About a bad weather forecast"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About logging activities"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 19, "lesson": 10, "title": "Sleep is your superpower - Matt Walker", "category": "Emotional Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/BVciktYZ", "transcript": {"en": "Thank you very much. Well, I would like\nto start with testicles. (Laughter) Men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles\nthan those who sleep seven hours or more. (Laughter) In addition, men who routinely sleep\njust four to five hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone\n10 years their senior. So a lack of sleep\nwill age a man by a decade in terms of that critical\naspect of wellness. And we see equivalent impairments\nin female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep. This is the best news\nthat I have for you today. (Laughter) From this point, it may only get worse. Not only will I tell you\nabout the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things\nthat happen when you don't get enough, both for your brain and for your body. Let me start with the brain and the functions of learning and memory, because what we've discovered\nover the past 10 or so years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save button\non those new memories so that you don't forget. But recently, we discovered\nthat you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up\nnew information. And without sleep,\nthe memory circuits of the brain essentially become\nwaterlogged, as it were, and you can't absorb new memories. So let me show you the data. Here in this study, we decided\nto test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter\nwas a good idea. So we took a group of individuals and we assigned them\nto one of two experimental groups: a sleep group\nand a sleep deprivation group. Now the sleep group, they're going to get\na full eight hours of slumber, but the deprivation group,\nwe're going to keep them awake in the laboratory, under full supervision. There's no naps or caffeine, by the way,\nso it's miserable for everyone involved. And then the next day, we're going to place those participants\ninside an MRI scanner and we're going to have them\ntry and learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots\nof brain activity. And then we're going to test them to see how effective\nthat learning has been. And that's what you're looking at\nhere on the vertical axis. And when you put\nthose two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant,\n40-percent deficit in the ability of the brain\nto make new memories without sleep. I think this should be concerning, considering what we know\nis happening to sleep in our education populations right now. In fact, to put that in context, it would be the difference\nin a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent. And we've gone on to discover\nwhat goes wrong within your brain to produce these types\nof learning disabilities. And there's a structure that sits on the left and the right side\nof your brain, called the hippocampus. And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational\ninbox of your brain. It's very good at receiving\nnew memory files and then holding on to them. And when you look at this structure in those people who'd had\na full night of sleep, we saw lots of healthy\nlearning-related activity. Yet in those people\nwho were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find\nany significant signal whatsoever. So it's almost as though sleep deprivation\nhad shut down your memory inbox, and any new incoming files --\nthey were just being bounced. You couldn't effectively\ncommit new experiences to memory. So that's the bad that can happen\nif I were to take sleep away from you, but let me just come back\nto that control group for a second. Do you remember those folks\nthat got a full eight hours of sleep? Well, we can ask\na very different question: What is it about the physiological\nquality of your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances\nyour memory and learning ability each and every day? And by placing electrodes\nall over the head, what we've discovered\nis that there are big, powerful brainwaves that happen during\nthe very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them these spectacular bursts\nof electrical activity that we call sleep spindles. And it's the combined quality\nof these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer\nmechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term\nvulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term\nstorage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them,\nmaking them safe. And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts\nthese memory benefits, because there are real medical\nand societal implications. And let me just tell you about one area that we've moved this work\nout into, clinically, which is the context of aging\nand dementia. Because it's of course no secret\nthat, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities\nbegin to fade and decline. But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging\nis that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep\nthat I was just discussing. And only last year,\nwe finally published evidence that these two things,\nthey're not simply co-occurring, they are significantly interrelated. And it suggests\nthat the disruption of deep sleep is an underappreciated factor that is contributing\nto cognitive decline or memory decline in aging, and most recently\nwe've discovered, in Alzheimer's disease as well. Now, I know this is remarkably\ndepressing news. It's in the mail. It's coming at you. But there's a potential\nsilver lining here. Unlike many of the other factors\nthat we know are associated with aging, for example changes\nin the physical structure of the brain, that's fiendishly difficult to treat. But that sleep is a missing piece\nin the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting because we may be able\nto do something about it. And one way that we are\napproaching this at my sleep center is not by using\nsleeping pills, by the way. Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments\nthat do not produce naturalistic sleep. Instead, we're actually developing\na method based on this. It's called direct current\nbrain stimulation. You insert a small amount\nof voltage into the brain, so small you typically don't feel it, but it has a measurable impact. Now if you apply this stimulation\nduring sleep in young, healthy adults, as if you're sort of singing in time\nwith those deep-sleep brainwaves, not only can you amplify\nthe size of those deep-sleep brainwaves, but in doing so, we can almost\ndouble the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep. The question now\nis whether we can translate this same affordable,\npotentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia. Can we restore back\nsome healthy quality of deep sleep, and in doing so, can we salvage\naspects of their learning and memory function? That is my real hope now. That's one of our moon-shot\ngoals, as it were. So that's an example\nof sleep for your brain, but sleep is just\nas essential for your body. We've already spoken about sleep loss\nand your reproductive system. Or I could tell you about sleep loss\nand your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour. Because there is a global experiment\nperformed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time. Now, in the spring,\nwhen we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase\nin heart attacks that following day. In the autumn,\nwhen we gain an hour of sleep, we see a 21-percent\nreduction in heart attacks. Isn't that incredible? And you see exactly the same profile\nfor car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates. But as a deeper dive,\nI want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system. And here, I'll introduce these delightful\nblue elements in the image. They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells\nalmost like the secret service agents of your immune system. They are very good at identifying\ndangerous, unwanted elements and eliminating them. In fact, what they're doing here\nis destroying a cancerous tumor mass. So what you wish for\nis a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have\nif you're not sleeping enough. So here in this experiment, you're not going to have your sleep\ndeprived for an entire night, you're simply going to have your sleep\nrestricted to four hours for one single night, and then we're going to look to see\nwhat's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer. And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent. There was a 70-percent drop\nin natural killer cell activity. That's a concerning state\nof immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand\nwhy we're now finding significant links between\nshort sleep duration and your risk for the development\nof numerous forms of cancer. Currently, that list includes\ncancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate\nand cancer of the breast. In fact, the link between a lack of sleep\nand cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form\nof nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, because of a disruption\nof your sleep-wake rhythms. So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead. Well, I'm being quite serious now -- it is mortally unwise advice. We know this from epidemiological studies\nacross millions of individuals. There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep,\nthe shorter your life. Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality. And if increasing your risk\nfor the development of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease were not sufficiently disquieting, we have since discovered\nthat a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA genetic code. So here in this study,\nthey took a group of healthy adults and they limited them\nto six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change\nin their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours\nof sleep a night. And there were two critical findings. First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep. The second result\nwas that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity. The other half were decreased. Now those genes that were switched off\nby a lack of sleep were genes associated\nwith your immune system, so once again, you can see\nthat immune deficiency. In contrast, those genes\nthat were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep, were genes associated\nwith the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term\nchronic inflammation within the body, and genes associated with stress, and, as a consequence,\ncardiovascular disease. There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign\nof sleep deprivation and get away unscathed. It's rather like a broken\nwater pipe in your home. Sleep loss will leak down\ninto every nook and cranny of your physiology, even tampering with\nthe very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out\nyour daily health narrative. And at this point, you may be thinking, \"Oh my goodness,\nhow do I start to get better sleep? What are you tips for good sleep?\" Well, beyond avoiding\nthe damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep, and if you're struggling\nwith sleep at night, avoiding naps during the day, I have two pieces of advice for you. The first is regularity. Go to bed at the same time,\nwake up at the same time, no matter whether\nit's the weekday or the weekend. Regularity is king, and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity\nand the quality of that sleep. The second is keep it cool. Your body needs to drop\nits core temperature by about two to three degrees\nFahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep, and it's the reason\nyou will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. So aim for a bedroom temperature\nof around 65 degrees, or about 18 degrees Celsius. That's going to be optimal\nfor the sleep of most people. And then finally,\nin taking a step back, then, what is the mission-critical\nstatement here? Well, I think it may be this: sleep, unfortunately,\nis not an optional lifestyle luxury. Sleep is a nonnegotiable\nbiological necessity. It is your life-support system, and it is Mother Nature's\nbest effort yet at immortality. And the decimation of sleep\nthroughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact\non our health, our wellness, even the safety and the education\nof our children. It's a silent sleep loss epidemic, and it's fast becoming one of the greatest\npublic health challenges that we face in the 21st century. I believe it is now time for us\nto reclaim our right to a full night of sleep, and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness. And in doing so, we can be reunited\nwith the most powerful elixir of life, the Swiss Army knife\nof health, as it were. And with that soapbox rant over, I will simply say, good night, good luck, and above all ... I do hope you sleep well. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. David Biello: No, no, no.\nStay there for a second. Good job not running away, though.\nI appreciate that. So that was terrifying. Matt Walker: You're welcome.\nDB: Yes, thank you, thank you. Since we can't catch up on sleep,\nwhat are we supposed to do? What do we do when we're, like,\ntossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else? MW: So you're right,\nwe can't catch up on sleep. Sleep is not like the bank. You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off\nat a later point in time. I should also note the reason\nthat it's so catastrophic and that our health\ndeteriorates so quickly, first, it's because human beings\nare the only species that deliberately deprive\nthemselves of sleep for no apparent reason. DB: Because we're smart. MW: And I make that point\nbecause it means that Mother Nature, throughout the course of evolution, has never had to face the challenge\nof this thing called sleep deprivation. So she's never developed a safety net, and that's why when you undersleep, things just sort of implode so quickly,\nboth within the brain and the body. So you just have to prioritize. DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed, what do I do? MW: So if you are staying in bed\nawake for too long, you should get out of bed\nand go to a different room and do something different. The reason is because your brain\nwill very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness, and you need to break that association. So only return to bed when you are sleepy, and that way you will relearn\nthe association that you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep. So the analogy would be, you'd never sit at the dinner table,\nwaiting to get hungry, so why would you lie in bed,\nwaiting to get sleepy? DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call. Great job, Matt. MW: You're very welcome.\nThank you very much."}, "multiple-choice": []}

There’s no definitive way of knowing what \nkilled these ancient people, but we do know their bones were infected \nby an all too familiar bacterium. The ancient Greeks knew its consumptive \neffects as phthisis; the Incans called it chaky oncay; \nand the English called it tuberculosis. Today, tuberculosis, or TB, is still one of the world’s biggest \ninfectious killers, causing more deaths than malaria or \neven HIV and AIDS. But what exactly is this disease, and how \nhas this pathogen persisted for so long? Typically, TB bacteria called \nmycobacterium tuberculosis, are airborne. They travel into our airways and \ninfect our lungs. Here, immune cells called macrophages \nrush to the infection site, attempting to absorb and break down \nthe bacterial invaders. In many cases, this response is enough \nto remove the bacteria. But in individuals with other \nmedical conditions– ranging from malnutrition and HIV to \ndiabetes and pregnancy –the immune response may not be \nstrong enough to destroy the intruder. If so, mycobacterium tuberculosis will \nreproduce inside those macrophages, and form colonies in the \nsurrounding lung tissue. As they infect more cells, the bacteria employ cell-degrading enzymes\nthat destroy the infected tissue, triggering chest pain, and causing \npatients to cough up blood. The damage to the lungs leads to \noxygen deprivation. This begins a flood of hormonal changes– including a decrease in appetite and \niron production. From here, microbes can spread to the \nskeletal system, causing back pain and difficulty moving; to the kidneys and intestines, \ncausing abdominal pain; and to the brain, causing headaches \nand even impaired consciousness. These symptoms produce the \nclassic image of TB: weight loss, a hacking, bloody cough, \nand ashen skin. This ghostly appearance earned TB \nthe title of the ‘White Plague’ in Victorian-era England. During this period, tuberculosis was \nconsidered a ‘romantic disease,' because it tended to affect poverty-\nstricken artists and poets– those with weaker immune systems. TB’s outward symptoms even helped \nfuel the popular myth of vampirism. In spite of– or perhaps because of \nthese less than scientific concerns, this period also marked the first strides \ntoward curing TB. In 1882, the German physician Robert Koch identified the disease’s \nbacterial origins. 13 years later, physicist Wilhelm \nRoentgen  discovered the X-ray, enabling physicians to diagnose and track \nits progression through the body. These techniques allowed researchers to \ndevelop reliable and effective vaccines– first for smallpox, and again in 1921, when scientists developed the BCG \nvaccine to battle TB. These developments laid the groundwork \nfor the modern field of antibiotics– currently home to our most effective \nTB treatments. But, antibiotics fail to address a major \ndiagnostic complication: about 90% of people infected with TB \ndon’t show any symptoms. In these latent infections, the TB \nbacterium may be dormant, only activating when someone’s immune \nsystem is too weak to mount a defense. This makes TB much harder to diagnose. And even when properly identified, traditional treatments can take \nup to 9 months, requiring multiple drugs and a high \npotential for side effects. This discourages people from finishing \nthe full course, and partial treatment enables bacteria to \ndevelop resistance to these drugs. Today, the disease is still prevalent \nin 30 countries, most of which face other health crises that exacerbate TB and \ntrigger latent cases. Worse still, accessing treatment can \nbe difficult in many of these countries, and the stigma towards TB can discourage \npeople from getting the help they need. Health experts agree we need to \ndevelop better diagnostics, faster acting antibiotics, and more \neffective vaccines. Researchers have already developed a urine\ntest that yields results in 12 hours, as well as a new oral treatment that could\ncut treatment time by 75%. Hopefully, with advancements like these, we’ll finally be able to make TB \nexclusively a thing of the past."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What kind of pathogen is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTb)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "virus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "bacterium"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fungus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "phage"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are the symptoms of tuberculosis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Coughing up blood"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pain with breathing or coughing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fever and weight loss"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "TB microbes can infect which of the following?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lungs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kidney"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Brain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why is treatment of tuberculosis challenging?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Treatment can take up to 9 months"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Patient needs to take multiple drugs which often have side effects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Some patients refuse treatment because of stigma towards TB"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which health conditions exacerbate tuberculosis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Malnutrition"}, {"label": "B", "text": "HIV / AIDS"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Diabetes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 19, "lesson": 12, "title": "The difference between healthy and unhealthy love - Katie Hood", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/oyW0POMB", "transcript": {"en": "So when you think about a child,\na close friend, or a romantic partner, the word \"love\" probably comes to mind, and instantly other emotions rush in: joy and hope, excitement, trust and security, and yes, sometimes\nsadness and disappointment. There might not be\na word in the dictionary that more of us\nare connected to than love. Yet, given its central\nimportance in our lives, isn't it interesting that we're never\nexplicitly taught how to love? We build friendships, navigate early romantic relationships, get married and bring babies\nhome from the hospital with the expectation\nthat we'll figure it out. But the truth is, we often\nharm and disrespect the ones we love. It can be subtle things like guilting a friend\ninto spending time with you or sneaking a peak at your partner's texts or shaming a child\nfor their lack of effort at school. 100 percent of us\nwill be on the receiving end of unhealthy relationship behaviors and 100 percent of us\nwill do unhealthy things. It's part of being human. In its worst form,\nthe harm we inflict on loved ones shows up as abuse and violence, and relationship abuse is something that one in three women\nand one in four men will experience in their lifetime. Now, if you're like most people,\nwhen you hear those stats, you'll go, \"Oh, no, no, no,\nthat would never happen to me.\" It's instinctual to move away\nfrom the words \"abuse\" and \"violence,\" to think that they happen\nto someone else somewhere else. But the truth is, unhealthy relationships\nand abuse are all around us. We just call them different things\nand ignore the connection. Abuse sneaks up on us\ndisguised in unhealthy love. I work for an organization called One Love started by a family whose daughter\nYeardley was killed by her ex-boyfriend. This was a tragedy no one saw coming, but when they looked back,\nthey realized the warning signs were there just no one understood\nwhat they were seeing. Called crazy or drama\nor too much drinking, his actions weren't understood\nto be what they really were, which was clear signs of danger. Her family realized that if anyone\nhad been educated about these signs, her death could have been prevented. So today we're on a mission to make sure that others have the information\nthat Yeardley and her friends didn't. We have three main goals: give all of us a language\nfor talking about a subject that's quite awkward\nand uncomfortable to discuss; empower a whole front line,\nnamely friends, to help; and, in the process, improve\nall of our ability to love better. To do this, it's always important\nto start by illuminating the unhealthy signs\nthat we frequently miss, and our work really focuses\non creating content to start conversations with young people. As you'd expect, most of our content\nis pretty serious, given the subject at hand, but today I'm going to use\none of our more light-hearted yet still thought-provoking pieces, \"The Couplets,\" to illuminate five markers\nof unhealthy love. The first is intensity. (Video) Blue: I haven't seen you\nin a couple days. I've missed you. Orange: I've missed you too. (#thatslove) Blue: I haven't seen you in five minutes.\nIt feels like a lifetime. What have you been doing\nwithout me for five whole minutes? Orange: It's been three minutes.\n(#thatsnotlove) Katie Hood: Anybody recognize that?\nI don't know. I do. Abusive relationships\ndon't start out abusive. They start out exciting and exhilarating. There's an intensity\nof affection and emotion, a rush. It feels really good. You feel so lucky,\nlike you've hit the jackpot. But in unhealthy love,\nthese feelings shift over time from exciting to overwhelming\nand maybe a little bit suffocating. You feel it in your gut. Maybe it's when your\nnew boyfriend or girlfriend says \"I love you\"\nfaster than you were ready for or starts showing up everywhere,\ntexting and calling a lot. Maybe they're impatient\nwhen you're slow to respond, even though they know\nyou had other things going on that day. It's important to remember that it's not\nhow a relationship starts that matters, it's how it evolves. It's important in the early days\nof a new relationship to pay attention to how you're feeling. Are you comfortable\nwith the pace of intimacy? Do you feel like you have space\nand room to breathe? It's also really important\nto start practicing using your voice to talk about your own needs. Are your requests respected? A second marker is isolation. (Video) Orange 2: Want to hang out? Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend\nalways have Monday Funday. Orange 2: Want to hang out? Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend\nalways have Monday Funday. Orange 2: Tomorrow?\nOrange 1: It's our Tuesday Snooze Day. Orange 2: Wednesday?\nOrange 1: No Friends Day. KH: If you ask me, isolation\nis one of the most frequently missed and misunderstood signs of unhealthy love. Why? Because every new relationship\nstarts out with this intense desire to spend time together, it's easy to miss when something shifts. Isolation creeps in\nwhen your new boyfriend or girlfriend starts pulling you away\nfrom your friends and family, your support system, and tethering you more tightly to them. They might say things like, \"Why do you hang out with them?\nThey're such losers\" about your best friends, or, \"They want us to break up.\nThey're totally against us\" about your family. Isolation is about sowing seeds of doubt about everyone from\nyour prerelationship life. Healthy love includes independence, two people who love spending time together but who stay connected to the people\nand activities they cared about before. While at first you might spend\nevery waking minute together, over time maintaining independence is key. You do this by making plans with friends\nand sticking to them and encouraging your partner\nto do the same. A third marker of unhealthy love\nis extreme jealousy. (Video) Blue 2:\nWhat are you so happy about? Blue 1: She just started\nfollowing me on Instagram! Blue 2: What are you so nervous about? Blue 1: She, she just started\nfollowing me, like, everywhere. (#thatsnotlove) KH: As the honeymoon period\nbegins to fade, extreme jealousy can creep in. Your partner might become more demanding, needing to know where you are\nand who you're with all the time, or they might start following you\neverywhere, online and off. Extreme jealousy also brings with it\npossessiveness and mistrust, frequent accusations\nof flirting with other people or cheating, and refusal to listen to you\nwhen you tell them they have nothing to worry about\nand that you only love them. Jealousy is a part\nof any human relationship, but extreme jealousy is different. There's a threatening, desperate\nand angry edge to it. Love shouldn't feel like this. A fourth marker is belittling. (Video) Blue: Wanna hang out?\nOrange: I gotta study. Blue: You'll get an A anyway,\nA for amazing. (#thatslove) Blue: Wanna hang out?\nOrange: I gotta study. Blue: You'll get an F anyway, F for, F for... stupid. (#thatsnotlove) KH: Yeah, hmm. In unhealthy love,\nwords are used as weapons. Conversations that used to be\nfun and lighthearted turn mean and embarrassing. Maybe your partner makes fun of you\nin a way that hurts, or maybe they tell stories and jokes\nfor laughs at your expense. When you try to explain\nthat your feelings have been hurt, they shut you down\nand accuse you of overreacting. \"Why are you so sensitive?\nWhat's your problem. Give me a break.\" You are silenced by these words. It seems pretty obvious,\nbut your partner should have your back. Their words should build you up,\nnot break you down. They should keep\nyour secrets and be loyal. They should make you feel more confident, not less. Finally, a fifth marker: volatility. (Video) Orange 1:\nI'd be sad if we broke up. Orange 2: I'd be sad too. (#thatslove) Orange 1: I'd so depressed\nif we ever broke up. I'd throw myself off this step. I would! Don't try to stop me! (#thatsnotlove) KH: Frequent breakups and makeups,\nhigh highs and low lows: as tension rises, so does volatility. Tearful, frustrated fights\nfollowed by emotional makeups, hateful and hurtful comments like, \"You're worthless,\nI'm not even sure why I'm with you!\" followed quickly by apologies\nand promises it will never happen again. By this point, you've been so conditioned\nto this relationship roller coaster that you may not realize how unhealthy\nand maybe even dangerous your relationship has become. It can be really hard to see when unhealthy love turns towards abuse, but it's fair to say\nthat the more of these markers your relationship might have, the more unhealthy and maybe dangerous\nyour relationship could be. And if your instinct is\nto break up and leave, which is advice\nso many of us give our friends when they're in unhealthy relationships, that's not always the best advice. Time of breakup can be\na real trigger for violence. If you fear you might be\nheaded towards abuse or in abuse, you need to consult with experts\nto get the advice on how to leave safely. But it's not just\nabout romantic relationships and it's not just about violence. Understanding the signs of unhealthy love can help you audit and understand\nnearly every relationship in your life. For the first time, you might understand\nwhy you're disappointed in a friendship or why every interaction\nwith a certain family member leaves you discouraged and anxious. You might even begin to see\nhow your own intensity and jealousy is causing problems\nwith colleagues at work. Understanding is\nthe first step to improving, and while you can't make\nevery unhealthy relationship healthy -- some you're going\nto have to leave behind -- you can do your part every day\nto do relationships better. And here's the exciting news: it's actually not rocket science. Open communication, mutual respect, kindness, patience -- we can practice these things every day. And while practice\nwill definitely make you better, I have to promise you\nit's also not going to make you perfect. I do this for a living and every day I think and talk\nabout healthy relationships, and still I do unhealthy things. Just the other day as I was trying\nto shuttle my four kids out the door amidst quarreling, squabbling\nand complaints about breakfast, I completely lost it. With an intentionally angry edge, I screamed, \"Everybody just shut up and do what I say! You are the worst! I am going to take away\nscreen time and dessert and anything else you could possibly\never enjoy in life!\" (Laughter) Anybody been there? (Applause) Volatility, belittling. My oldest son turned around\nand looked at me, and said, \"Mom, that's not love.\" (Laughter) For a minute, I really wanted\nto kill him for calling me out. Trust me. But then I gathered myself and I thought, you know what,\nI'm actually proud. I'm proud that he has a language\nto make me pause. I want all of my kids to understand\nwhat the bar should be for how they're treated and to have a language and a voice\nto use when that bar is not met versus just accepting it. For too long, we've treated\nrelationships as a soft topic, when relationship skills\nare one of the most important and hard to build things in life. Not only can understanding unhealthy signs help you avoid the rabbit hole\nthat leads to unhealthy love, but understanding and practicing\nthe art of being healthy can improve nearly\nevery aspect of your life. I'm completely convinced that while love is\nan instinct and an emotion, the ability to love better\nis a skill we can all build and improve on over time. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Beneath the thick ice of Europa, in the vapor plumes on Enceladus, and within the methane lakes of Titan, astrobiologists are on the hunt \nfor extraterrestrial life. We’ve honed in on these three moons \nbecause each is an ‘ocean world,’ an environment that contains \na liquid ocean– and liquid can support \nthe formation of life. Living organisms have to be able to grow, \nreproduce, and feed themselves, among other things. All of those functions require the \nformation of complex molecules from more basic components. Liquids such as water allow chemical \ncompounds to remain in suspension instead of sinking under \nthe force of gravity. This enables them to interact frequently\nin a 3-dimensional space and, in the right conditions, go through chemical reactions that \nlead to the formation of living matter. That alone isn’t enough; the small but complex biomolecules \nthat we’re familiar with are sensitive to temperature— too hot or cold, and they won’t mix. Liquid water has an additional advantage in that it’s relatively \ntemperature-stable, meaning it can insulate molecules against\nlarge shifts in heat. On Earth, these and other conditions in \naquatic environments may have supported the emergence \nof life billions of years ago. Tantalizingly, the same could be true\nin other parts of our solar system, like these three icy moons. Europa, which is a moon of Jupiter, is probably the most \nintriguing ocean world. Beneath a surface layer of ice thicker \nthan Mount Everest, there exists a liquid ocean as much as\n100 kilometers deep. Astrobiologists think this hidden \nocean could harbor life. Thanks to the Galileo probe, we can deduce that its \npotential salt content is similar to that of some lakes on Earth. But most of its characteristics will be a \nmystery until we can explore it further. Like Jupiter, Saturn also has moons that \nmight have the right conditions for life. For instance– Enceladus is a tiny ball of \nice that’s small enough to nestle within the surface area \nof the Gulf of Mexico. Similarly to Europa, it likely contains an\nocean deep under the ice. But Enceladus also has geysers that frequently vent water vapor and \ntiny ice grains into space. Astrobiologists are curious about whether\nthese geysers are connected to the ocean below. They hope to send a probe to test whether\nthe geysers’ plumes of vapor contain life-enabling material\nfrom that hidden sea. Although it’s the best known substance \nfor nurturing life, water isn’t necessarily the only medium\nthat can support living things. Take Titan, Saturn’s largest moon, which has a thick nitrogen atmosphere containing methane and many other \norganic molecules. Its clouds condense and \nrain onto Titan’s surface, sustaining lakes and seas \nfull of liquid methane. This compound’s particular chemistry means\nit’s not as supportive a medium as water. But, paired with the high quantities \nof organic material that also rain down from the sky, these bodies of liquid methane could\npossibly support unfamiliar life forms. So what might indicate that life exists on\nthese or other worlds? If it is out there, astrobiologists \nspeculate that it would be microscopic, comparable to the bacteria \nwe have on earth. This would make it difficult to directly \nobserve from a great distance, so astrobiologists seek clues \ncalled biosignatures. Those may be cells, fossils, or mineral \ntraces left behind by living things. And finding any biosignatures will be \nchallenging for many reasons. One of the biggest concerns is to make sure we sterilize our \nprobes extremely thoroughly. Otherwise we could accidentally \ncontaminate ocean worlds with Earth’s own bacteria, which could destroy alien life. Titan, Enceladus, and Europa are just three of possibly many \nocean worlds that we could explore. We already know of several other \ncandidates in our solar system, including Jupiter’s moons Callisto and \nGanymede, Neptune’s Triton, and even Pluto.

{"page": 19, "lesson": 14, "title": "How do crystals work? - Graham Baird", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-crystals-work-graham-baird", "transcript": {"en": "Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs \nof Yellowstone Caldera lies a magma chamber produced by a \nhot spot in the earth’s mantle. As the magma moves towards \nthe Earth’s surface, it crystallizes to form young, \nhot igneous rocks. The heat from these rocks drives \ngroundwater towards the surface. As the water cools, ions precipitate out \nas mineral crystals, including quartz crystals from silicon \nand oxygen, feldspar from potassium, aluminum, \nsilicon, and oxygen, galena from lead and sulfur. Many of these crystals have signature \nshapes— take this cascade of pointed quartz, \nor this pile of galena cubes. But what causes them to grow into these\nshapes again and again? Part of the answer lies in their atoms. Every crystal’s atoms are arranged \nin a highly organized, repeating pattern. This pattern is the defining \nfeature of a crystal, and isn’t restricted to minerals— sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics, \nmetals, DNA, and even some liquids have \ncrystalline structures. Each crystalline material’s atomic \narrangement falls into one of six different families: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, \nmonoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonal. Given the appropriate conditions, crystals will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement \nof their atoms. Take galena, which has a cubic structure \ncomposed of lead and sulfur atoms. The relatively large lead atoms are arranged in a three-dimensional \ngrid 90 degrees from one another, while the relatively small sulfur atoms \nfit neatly between them. As the crystal grows, locations like these\nattract sulfur atoms, while lead will tend to \nbond to these places. Eventually, they will complete the grid \nof bonded atoms. This means the 90 degree grid pattern \nof galena’s crystalline structure is reflected in the visible \nshape of the crystal. Quartz, meanwhile, has a hexagonal \ncrystalline structure. This means that on one plane its atoms \nare arranged in hexagons. In three dimensions, these hexagons are \ncomposed of many interlocking pyramids made up of one silicon atom \nand four oxygen atoms. So the signature shape of a quartz \ncrystal is a six-sided column with pointed tips. Depending on environmental conditions, most crystals have the potential to form\nmultiple geometric shapes. For example, diamonds, which form deep\nin the Earth’s mantle, have a cubic crystalline structure and can\ngrow into either cubes or octahedrons. Which shape a particular \ndiamond grows into depends on the conditions where it grows, including pressure, temperature, \nand chemical environment. While we can’t directly observe growth \nconditions in the mantle, laboratory experiments have shown some\nevidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at \nlower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures. Trace amounts of water, silicon, \ngermanium, or magnesium might also influence a diamond’s shape. And diamonds never naturally grow into the\nshapes found in jewelry— those diamonds have been cut to \nshowcase sparkle and clarity. Environmental conditions can also \ninfluence whether crystals form at all. Glass is made of melted quartz sand, but it isn’t crystalline. That’s because glass cools \nrelatively quickly, and the atoms do not have time to arrange\nthemselves into the ordered structure \nof a quartz crystal. Instead, the random arrangement \nof the atoms in the melted glass is locked in upon cooling. Many crystals don’t form geometric shapes because they grow in extremely close \nquarters with other crystals. Rocks like granite are full of crystals, but none have recognizable shapes. As magma cools and solidifies, many minerals within it crystallize at the\nsame time and quickly run out of space. And certain crystals, like turquoise, don’t grow into any discernible geometric\nshape in most environmental conditions, even given adequate space. Every crystal’s atomic structure has \nunique properties, and while these properties may not have\nany bearing on human emotional needs, they do have powerful applications \nin materials science and medicine."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What elements make up the mineral galena?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Silicon and oxygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Potassium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sodium and chlorine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lead and sulfur"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How are the atoms generally arranged in crystals?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Randomly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Always in a highly organized, repeating way"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Always in a double helix"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Scientists have not figured this out yet"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What geometric shape does quartz form when it grows as a perfect crystal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A six-sided column with pointed tips"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A cube"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An octohedron"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Quartz never grows as a geometric shape"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why does glass have a random arrangement of atoms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The elements that make up glass does not allow its atoms to be arranged in an highly organized, repeating way"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The random atomic arrangement of the liquid glass is locked in with fast cooling"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The random atomic arrangement of the liquid glass is locked in with quick cooling"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because it wasn’t made by a volcano"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is one important requirement listed below that help allows a growing crystal to form a geometric shape?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The crystal must contain silicon and oxygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "There must be open space for the crystal to grow into"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Space must be limited for the growing crystal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The crystal must grow rapidly"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is origin of the shapes of diamond found in jewelry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The diamond is cut into the shapes seen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The diamond must have grown in the earth’s mantle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The diamond must have grown in the presence of germanium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The diamond must have grown at very high pressure"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But recent studies show that 33% of wild \nfisheries are overfished, while another 60% are fished at their \nmaximum capacity. In fact, over half the seafood we eat– from finfish and shellfish to \nseaweed and algae– isn’t caught in the wild. It’s grown through aquaculture, \nor aquatic farming. Farmed seafood is one of the \nfastest-growing food industries, expanding in volume by 5.8% each year. But different methods of aquaculture come \nwith different advantages and issues– some of which echo the serious problems \nwe’ve seen in industrial agriculture. So how can we avoid repeating the mistakes\nwe’ve made on land, at sea? What aquaculture approaches are we \ncurrently using, and what does a sustainable way \nto farm the ocean really look like? One of the most common aquaculture \nmethods involves large pens made of nets, where fish are farmed offshore in floating\ncages roughly 1000 square meters in size. Commonly employed off the coast of Chile\nand in the fjords of Norway, these fish, like many industrially \nfarmed animals, occupy stressful, overcrowded pens. They produce massive amounts of waste, polluting the surrounding areas and potentially spreading diseases\nto wild species. Worse still, since the antibiotics \nemployed to fight disease aren’t fully absorbed by the fish, they get excreted back \ninto the environment. Net pens are also susceptible to escapes, unleashing huge numbers of fish which \ncompete for resources and weaken the local gene pool \nwith genes adapted for captivity. Escaped fish can even disrupt local \necosystems as invasive species. Other techniques, such as man-made coastal ponds commonly\nused for shrimp farming in Southeast Asia, create additional environmental problems. Just like net pens, these ponds are prone\nto spreading pollution and disease. Their construction also frequently \ndestroys important ecosystems like mangroves and marshes, which protect coastal areas from storms, provide habitats, and absorb tons \nof greenhouse gases. One way to solve these problems is to farm\nfish on land in completely contained systems. Tanks and raceways can recirculate and \nfilter water to prevent pollution. But even fully contained facilities still \ncontend with another major hurdle: fishmeal. About 10% of the seafood caught globally\nis used to feed animals, including carnivorous farmed fish. Researchers are working on fish feed made \nof insects and plant-based proteins, but for now many inland fish farms \nare connected to overfishing. All these obstacles can make sustainable \naquaculture feel a long way off, but innovative farmers are finding new \nways to responsibly farm the seas. The most promising solution of all \nmay be to look lower on the food chain. Instead of cramming large, carnivorous \nfish into pens, we can work with natural ocean systems to produce huge amounts of shellfish \nand seaweeds. These low-maintenance flora and fauna \ndon’t need to be fed at all. In fact, they naturally improve \nwater quality, filtering it as they feed off of sunlight \nand nutrients in the seawater. By absorbing carbon through \nphotosynthesis, these farms help battle climate change, and reduce local ocean acidification while creating habitats for other \nspecies to thrive. Shifting to restorative ocean farming could provide good jobs for \ncoastal communities, and support healthy plant and \nshellfish-based diets that have an incredibly \nlow carbon footprint. In just 5 months, 4,000 square meters of ocean can \nproduce 25 tons of seaweed and 250,000 of shellfish. With the right distribution network, a series of small farms, collectively \nthe size of Washington State could feed the planet. Farms like these are already popping up\naround the globe, and a new generation of farmers is \nstepping up to pursue a more sustainable future. Done properly, regenerative ocean farming could play\na vital role in helping our oceans, our climate, and ourselves."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What percentage of wild fisheries are considered to be overfished?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "60%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "93%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "33%"}, {"label": "E", "text": "63%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is a common downside of net pens, one of the most common forms of aquaculture?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "overcrowding"}, {"label": "B", "text": "disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the use of antibiotics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "escapes"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What species is commonly farmed in man-made coastal ponds?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "salmon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "shrimp"}, {"label": "C", "text": "catfish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "tuna"}, {"label": "E", "text": "oysters"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Approximately how much of the seafood caught globally is used to feed farm animals and carnivorous fish?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "33%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "90%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "E", "text": "none of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is a benefit of regenerative ocean farming?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "absorbs carbon and produces oxygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "produces healthy food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "creates jobs in coastal communities"}, {"label": "D", "text": "improves water quality and reduces ocean acidification"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

Chan", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-close-are-we-to-eradicating-hiv-philip-a-chan", "transcript": {"en": "The world is getting closer to achieving one of the most important \npublic health goals of our time: eradicating HIV. And to do this, we won’t even have \nto cure the disease. We simply have to stop HIV from \nbeing transmitted until eventually it fizzles out. Once, this goal would have \nseemed impossible. HIV has caused millions of deaths and is one of the most devastating \ndiseases that humanity has ever known. But we’re now at a point where new \nadvances such as one-pill, once-a-day medications are helping us tackle HIV \nin effective ways. HIV is a retrovirus– meaning it integrates copies of itself \ninto an infected cell’s DNA, allowing it to replicate and \ninfect other cells. HIV has evolved numerous ways to evade \nthe human immune system, which makes it difficult to cure. But by developing ways to \nblock HIV replication, we can stop the spread of HIV itself. That’s where antiretrovirals–\na.k.a. ARVs– come in. ARVs are a group of drugs which work \nin different ways to combat HIV. Some block HIV’s access into immune cells, and others work by stopping the \nvirus itself from replicating. ARVs also work preventatively in people \nwho don’t have HIV. This type of approach is called \npre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. PrEP works by accumulating in a \nperson’s body and preventing HIV from \nestablishing itself. That means an HIV-negative person who may\nbe at risk of contracting the disease can take certain ARVs \nto protect themselves, before they become exposed. Here’s where it gets \nespecially interesting: In people with HIV, ARVs can also \ndramatically reduce HIV transmission. This is called “Treatment as Prevention.” On a global scale, this has the potential \nto end the HIV epidemic. It’s based on the idea that someone with\nHIV who takes ARV’s can lower the virus level in their bodies\nuntil it becomes undetectable. That doesn’t mean the virus is gone; it could still be lurking within cells, \nready to reactivate if treatment stops. But so long as it’s kept \ndormant with drugs, HIV remains undetectable. And when HIV is undetectable, \nit’s untransmittable, too. In theory this means that by testing \neveryone who’s at risk of HIV and treating those who test positive, we could stop transmission and \neventually eradicate HIV. In the real world, however, \nthings are more complex. Many at-risk HIV negative people across \nthe world do not have access to PrEP or ARVs, and those who are HIV positive may \nexperience challenges to taking ARVs. These problems are often greatest in \ncountries where the burden of HIV is highest. Getting these medications depends on \naccess to a functioning healthcare system– and this isn’t something everyone has. That’s part of the reason why stopping \nthe spread of HIV for good will require a significant investment of \nresources to improve those systems. One study carried out by the UNAIDS estimated that between 20-30 billion \ndollars per year would be needed to achieve \na nearly 90% reduction in new HIV infections by 2030. This investment would ensure more people\nwould get tested in the first place, and more would be able to access and \nmaintain treatment. Achieving this goal and improving \nhealthcare in general is in everyone’s best interest, from individual people to \nsociety as a whole. We have roadmaps that could allow us to bring the HIV epidemic to an \nend in the near future, with the possibility of eradicating the \ndisease altogether several generations in the future. In the period from 1996 to 2017 we almost halved the number \nof new HIV infections, and for the millions of people who still \nlive with the virus, ARV treatments enable most to lead long \nand healthy lives. With continued and increased investments, we can get transmission rates low enough\nto end HIV once and for all. A world without HIV is no longer \ninconceivable: it’s closer than ever."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following can prevent HIV transmission?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Condoms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "PrEP"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Someone who is HIV positive and undetectable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Other sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia can increase your risk of being infected with HIV.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "People who are HIV positive may not feel sick and be unaware they are infected.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Someone who is HIV positive and “undetectable” on antiretrovirals can still transmit HIV.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Eating chocolate reduces \nstress in students. New drug prolongs lives of \npatients with rare disease. Health headlines like these \nare published every day, sometimes making opposite claims \nfrom each other. There can be a disconnect between broad, attention-grabbing headlines \nand the often specific, incremental results of the medical \nresearch they cover. So how can you avoid being \nmisled by grabby headlines? The best way to assess a headline’s \ncredibility is to look at the original \nresearch it reports on. We’ve come up with a hypothetical research\nscenario for each of these three headlines. Keep watching for the explanation\nof the first example; then pause at the headline to \nanswer the question. These are simplified scenarios. A real study would detail many more \nfactors and how it accounted for them, but for the purposes of this exercise, assume all the information \nyou need is included. Let’s start by considering the \ncardiovascular effects of a certain vitamin, Healthium. The study finds that participants taking\nHealthium had a higher level of healthy cholesterol \nthan those taking a placebo. Their levels became similar to those of \npeople with naturally high levels of this kind of cholesterol. Previous research has shown that people \nwith naturally high levels of healthy cholesterol have lower \nrates of heart disease. So what makes this headline misleading: \"Healthium reduces risk of heart disease.\" The problem with this headline is that the\nresearch didn’t actually investigate whether Healthium reduces heart disease. It only measured Healthium’s impact on levels of a particular \nkind of cholesterol. The fact that people with naturally high\nlevels of that cholesterol have lower risk of heart attacks doesn’t mean that the same \nwill be true of people who elevate their cholesterol\nlevels using Healthium. Now that you’ve cracked the \ncase of Healthium, try your hand at a particularly alluring \nmystery: the relationship between eating chocolate\nand stress. This hypothetical study \nrecruits ten students. Half begin consuming a \ndaily dose of chocolate, while half abstain. As classmates, they all follow \nthe same schedule. By the end of the study, the chocolate \neaters are less stressed than their chocolate-free counterparts. What’s wrong with this headline: \"Eating chocolate reduces \nstress in students\" It’s a stretch to draw a conclusion about \nstudents in general from a sample of ten. That’s because the fewer participants are\nin a random sample, the less likely it is that the sample will\nclosely represent the target population as a whole. For example, if the broader population of \nstudents is half male and half female, the chance of drawing a sample of 10 that’s skewed 70% male and \n30% is about 12%. In a sample of 100 that would be less than\na .0025% chance, and for a sample of 1000, the odds are less than 6 x 10^-36. Similarly, with fewer participants, each individual’s outcome has a larger \nimpact on the overall results— and can therefore skew big-picture trends. Still, there are a lot of good reasons for\nscientists to run small studies. By starting with a small sample, they can evaluate whether the results are \npromising enough to run a more comprehensive, \nexpensive study. And some research requires very specific\nparticipants that may be impossible to \nrecruit in large numbers. The key is reproducibility— if an article draws a conclusion \nfrom one small study, that conclusion may be suspect— but if it’s based on many studies \nthat have found similar results, it’s more credible. We’ve still got one more puzzle. In this scenario, a study tests a new drug\nfor a rare, fatal disease. In a sample of 2,000 patients, the ones who start taking the drug upon \ndiagnosis live longer than those who \ntake the placebo. This time, the question \nis slightly different. What’s one more thing you’d like to know \nbefore deciding if the headline, \"New drug prolongs lives of patients\nwith rare disease\", is justified? Before making this call, you’d want to know how much the drug \nprolonged the patients’ lives. Sometimes, a study can have results that, while scientifically valid, don’t have \nmuch bearing on real world outcomes. For example, one real-life clinical trial \nof a pancreatic cancer drug found an increase in life expectancy—\nof ten days. The next time you see a surprising medical\nheadline, take a look at the science \nit’s reporting on. Even when full papers aren’t \navailable without a fee, you can often find summaries of \nexperimental design and results in freely available abstracts, or even within the text \nof a news article. It’s exciting to see scientific research \ncovered in the news, and important to understand \nthe studies’ findings."}, "multiple-choice": []}

The story begins \nwhen a meeting between two members of Moscow’s literary elite is interrupted by a strange gentleman \nnamed Woland, who presents himself as a foreign scholar invited to give a presentation \non black magic. As the stranger engages the two companions\nin a philosophical debate and makes ominous predictions \nabout their fates, the reader is suddenly transported \nto 1st century Jerusalem. There a tormented Pontius Pilate reluctantly sentences \nJesus of Nazareth to death. With the narrative \nshifting between the two settings, Woland and his entourage– \nAzazello, Koroviev, Hella, and a giant cat named Behemoth– are seen to have uncanny magical powers, which they use to stage their performance while leaving a trail \nof havoc and confusion in their wake. Much of the novel’s dark humor \ncomes not only from this demonic mischief, but also the backdrop \nagainst which it occurs. Bulgakov’s story takes place \nin the same setting where it was written– the USSR \nat the height of the Stalinist period. There, artists and authors \nworked under strict censorship, subject to imprisonment, \nexile, or execution if they were seen \nas undermining state ideology. Even when approved, their work– along with housing, travel, \nand everything else– was governed by a convoluted bureaucracy. In the novel, Woland manipulates this system \nalong with the fabric of reality, to hilarious results. As heads are separated from bodies \nand money rains from the sky, the citizens of Moscow \nreact with petty-self interest, illustrating how Soviet society \nbred greed and cynicism despite its ideals. And the matter-of-fact narration deliberately blends \nthe strangeness of the supernatural events with the everyday absurdity \nof Soviet life. So how did Bulgakov \nmanage to publish such a subversive novel under an oppressive regime? Well… he didn’t. He worked on \"The Master and Margarita\"\nfor over ten years. But while Stalin’s personal favor may have kept Bulgakov \nsafe from severe persecution, many of his plays and writings \nwere kept from production, leaving him safe but effectively silenced. Upon the author’s death in 1940, the manuscript remained unpublished. A censored version \nwas eventually printed in the 1960s, while copies of the unabridged manuscript continued to circulate \namong underground literary circles. The full text was only published in 1973, over 30 years after its completion. Bulgakov’s experiences \nwith censorship and artistic frustration lend an autobiographical air \nto the second part of the novel, when we are finally \nintroduced to its namesake. \"The Master\" is a nameless author \nwho’s worked for years on a novel but burned the manuscript \nafter it was rejected by publishers– just as Bulgakov \nhad done with his own work. Yet the true protagonist \nis the Master’s mistress Margarita. Her devotion \nto her lover’s abandoned dream bears a strange connection \nto the diabolical company’s escapades– and carries the story \nto its surreal climax. Despite its dark humor \nand complex structure, \"The Master and Margarita\" \nis, at its heart, a meditation on art, love, and redemption, that never loses itself in cynicism. And the book’s long overdue publication \nand survival against the odds is a testament \nto what Woland tells the Master: “Manuscripts don’t burn.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where and when was the novel written?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "New York, 1920s"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Moscow, 1930s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Paris, 1950s"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the novel’s secondary setting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egypt, 2nd millennium BCE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Russia, 13th century CE"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jerusalem, 1st century CE"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the official reason given for Woland’s arrival?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He is giving an academic presentation on black magic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He plans to topple the Soviet leadership"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He is claiming Margarita’s soul"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When was the full uncensored text of the novel finally published?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1965"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1973"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1940"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who is the titular \"Master\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Devil"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Joseph Stalin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A nameless writer"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

But don’t be fooled by their \nbeachside behavior. Under the waves, sea lions are \nincredible endurance hunters. Hurtling around at speeds from \n4 to 18 miles an hour and hunting for up to 30 hours at a time, these majestic mammals live \nup to their name. And thanks to a suite of \nphysical adaptations, finely tuned over millions of years, \nthey make for resourceful foragers. To find their favorite food, sea lions hunt much deeper than \nmany of their semi-aquatic peers. With some species diving to \ndepths of nearly 400 meters, they’re able to cope with \nthe mounting pressure by collapsing their pliable rib cage, \nand compressing a pair of springy lungs. This pushes air up through \nthe smaller airways, collapsing rings of cartilage as \noxygen travels out from the lungs, to be held in the larger, upper airways. Upon surfacing, this air will be \nused to re-inflate the lungs, but for now their heart slows \ndown to preserve oxygen. Blood flow is redirected towards \nonly the most essential organs like the heart, lungs, and brain, which rely on reserve oxygen \nstored in blood and muscle. Once they arrive at their hunting ground, sea lions depend on their superior \nvision to find their prey. Most mammal eyes have \na structure called a lens– a transparent, convex structure whose \nshape refracts light to enable sight. In humans, this lens is curved to process \nlight waves traveling through air. But sea lions need to see their \nbest at hundreds of meters deep. To accommodate, their eyes have a much \nrounder lens to refract light underwater, as well as teardrop-shaped pupils which can expand to 25 times \ntheir original size. This lets in as much light as possible, helping them pinpoint their prey in \neven the dimmest conditions. But once they’ve closed in, they rely on something akin to a sixth \nsense to actually catch their meal. Their whiskers, or vibrissae, are composed of keratin \nand full of nerve fibers that run deep into the connective \ntissue of their face. Sea lions have full directional control \nover these whiskers, which can lie flat against their face, \nor stick out at a 90-degree angle. When properly tuned, these whiskers can sense the slim trails \nof moving water fish leave in their wake. And they’re precise enough to let \nblindfolded sea lions tell the difference between objects less \nthan two centimeters different in size. With these tools a healthy sea lion can\ncatch generous helpings of fish such as anchovy, mackerel, \nand squid on every outing. And with their exceptional memories, they \ncan remember multiple hunting grounds, including those they haven’t \nvisited in decades. This memory also extends to breeding \nterritories and birthing areas, as well as which neighbors \nare friend and foe. There’s even evidence that sea lions \ncan remember how to perform tasks after 10 years with no \npractice in between, letting them navigate old stomping \ngrounds with ease. Yet despite these incredible adaptations, there are changes unfolding \nin their habitats too rapidly for sea lions to handle. As climate change warms the oceans, \ncertain toxic algae species thrive. This algae is harmless to \nthe fish who eat it, but for the sea lions which \ningest those fish, the algae’s domoic acid can trigger \nseizures and brain damage. Changing ocean conditions keep \nthis algae blooming year round, causing more and more sea lions \nto wash up on beaches. This tragic discovery is just one \nof the many ways the health of aquatic animal \ncommunities can help us better understand Earth’s oceans. These red flags help us take action to protect ourselves and other \nmaritime mammals. And the more we can learn about the \nchanging ocean that sea lions inhabit, the better equipped we’ll be to help \nthese clever creatures thrive."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does a sea lion’s lens differ from a human’s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A sea lion lens is teardrop-shaped to refract light underwater, while a human lens is round to see in air"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A sea lion lens is round to refract light underwater, while a human lens is curved to see in air"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A sea lion lens is round to see in air, while a human lens is flat to see bright light"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A sea lion lens is teardrop-shaped to see underwater, while a human lens is round to see when diving"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Sea lions rely on their ________ to detect fish close to their face.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eyes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ears"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nose"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vibrissae"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When diving, how do sea lions get oxygen to their heart and brain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oxygen stored in their lungs moves to their heart and brain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Oxygen moves from their upper airways to their heart and brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oxygen stored in blood and muscle moves to their heart and brain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No additional oxygen is needed when diving underwater"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Domoic acid is a toxin produced by certain toxic algae species, whose harmful blooms are becoming more frequent as climate change warms the oceans.
