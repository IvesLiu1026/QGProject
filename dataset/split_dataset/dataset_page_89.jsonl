Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin are widely accepted, The debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture. Why is that? Why is the same thing treated so differently? Let's try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs. Humans have been genetically modifing plants and animals for thousands of years. Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields. Maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal. So you did the smart thing, and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you. Traits suggest an expression of genes. So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced. After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different from its pre-domesticated state. If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a so called \"Genetically Modified Organism\", or GMO, different? Selective breeding is basically hoping for lucky hits. Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want. Make fruit grow bigger, immune to pests, and so on. So, why are people concerned about them ? Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs. Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new characteristics into them. There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention, but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself. Terminator seeds. The idea is that they could produce sterile plants, requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year. The very concept of this, however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use. This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA. There have been cases of GMOs growing where they weren't planted, and traces of modified genes found in foreign crops. But GM plants can't run wild entirely. Many crops pollinate themselves, and all crops have to be related to mingle. There are also cultural methods like buffer zones, to keep unintentional crossing at a minimum. But if it's possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally cross with a non-GMO, there's actually a more important question. Is food that comes from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops? This question has been a major concern from the very beginning. GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible dangers, and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies. After more than 30 years and thousands of studies, the science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent. But don't just take it our word for it, the sources for this and other claims are in the video description. But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic? For example, BT crops. A gene borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus Thuringiensis, lets engineered plants produce a protein that destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests. The plant makes its own pesticide. Insects that eat it die. That sounds alarming! Pesticide sprays could be washed off. While the poison in BT crops is inside the plant. But actually, it's not a big deal. Poison is really just a question of different perspectives. What's harmless to one species, might kill another. Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us. Or take chocolate, it's dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans. BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of certain insects; it's completely harmless for us. There's also the opposite approach. Plants that are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers. This way, farmers can use them widely, killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop. Here, we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs. For the pesticide industry, they are big business. Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate. As a result, the use of glyphosate has increased greatly. That isn't only bad, glyphosate is much less harmful to humans than many other herbicides. Still, this means famers have a strong incentive to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside. That's one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate. Much of the criticism of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and a business practice of the huge corporations that control our food supply. This criticism is not only valid, it's also important. We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model. GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not a enemy in that fight, helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment. Let's look at some positive examples. Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh but often, whole harvests are destroyed by pests. Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides. Not only was this very expensive, Farmers also frequently got sick. The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this. The same BT protein we talked about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them. This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improved, and their income rose dramatically. And sometimes, the GM approach is the only option. In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a papaya genetically modified to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state's papaya industry would have collapsed. All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now produce pesticides, or are resistant against them. There is so much more we could do. The scientists are working on GMOs that could improve our diet. Plants that produce more or different nutrients, like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases or rice with additional vitamins. On a larger scale, we're trying to engineer plants more resilient to climate change, plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions, making them resistant to droughts or floods. GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture's impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it. Scientists are working on crops that can draw nitrogen from the air, like microbes. Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its build-up pollutes the ground water and speeds up climate change. Plants that collect their own nitrogen could fix two problems at once. The over use of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as the shortage of it in developing countries. We could even modify plants to become super-effective carbon collectors,  like the American chestnut tree, to mitigate and actually reverse climate change. With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit. The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day. A UN estimate suggests we'll need 70% more by 2050. We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures and by using more pesticides. Or we find a way to do it on the land we've got right now, with more effective methods like GM crops. Intensifying farming instead of expanding it means GMOs could become the new organic. In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only drastically change agriculture but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior. GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere. This video took more than 600 hours to make, which would be impossible without viewer support on Patreon.com.

Digging a hole under the city \nand putting a railroad in it seemed the stuff of dreams. Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea and a local minister accused the railway\ncompany of trying to break into hell. Most people simply thought the project, which cost more than\n100 million dollars in today’s money, would never work. But it did. On January 10, 1863, 30,000 people ventured underground \nto travel on the world’s first subway on a four-mile stretch of line in London. After three years of construction\nand a few setbacks, the Metropolitan Railway \nwas ready for business. The city’s officials were much relieved. They’d been desperate to find a way to reduce the terrible \ncongestion on the roads. London, at the time the world’s largest \nand most prosperous city, was in a permanent state of gridlock, with carts, costermongers, cows, and commuters jamming the roads. It’d been a Victorian visionary, \nCharles Pearson, who first thought of putting railways \nunder the ground. He’d lobbied for underground trains \nthroughout the 1840s, but opponents thought the idea\nwas impractical since the railroads at the time \nonly had short tunnels under hills. How could you get a railway \nthrough the center of a city? The answer was a simple system \ncalled \"cut and cover.\" Workers had to dig a huge trench, construct a tunnel out of brick archways, and then refill the hole \nover the newly built tunnel. Because this was disruptive and required the demolition \nof buildings above the tunnels, most of the line went\nunder existing roads. Of course, there were accidents. On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm \nflooded the nearby sewers and burst through the excavation, delaying the project by several months. But as soon as \nthe Metropolitan Railway opened, Londoners rushed in \nto ride the new trains. The Metropolitan quickly became \na vital part of London’s transport system. Additional lines were soon built, and new suburbs grew around the stations. Big department stores opened \nnext to the railroad, and the railway company \neven created attractions, like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls\nCourt to bring in tourists by train. Within 30 years, London’s subway system covered \n80 kilometers, with lines in the center of town\nrunning in tunnels, and suburban trains operating \non the surface, often on embankments. But London was still growing, and everyone wanted \nto be connected to the system. By the late 1880s, the city had become too dense with\nbuildings, sewers, and electric cables for the \"cut and cover\" technique, so a new system had to be devised. Using a machine \ncalled the Greathead Shield, a team of just 12 workers could \nbore through the earth, carving deep underground tunnels \nthrough the London clay. These new lines, called tubes,\nwere at varying depths, but usually about 25 meters deeper than \nthe \"cut and cover\" lines. This meant their construction \ndidn’t disturb the surface, and it was possible \nto dig under buildings. The first tube line, \nthe City and South London, opened in 1890 and proved so successful that half a dozen more lines \nwere built in the next 20 years. This clever new technology was even used \nto burrow several lines under London’s river, the Thames. By the early 20th century, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, and New York had all built subways of their own. And today, with more than 160 cities \nin 55 countries using underground rails \nto combat congestion, we can thank Charles Pearson\nand the Metropolitan Railway for getting us started on the right track."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "On the first day, how many people traveled on the line?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "250"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "25,000"}, {"label": "E", "text": "30,000"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "In what year was the world’s first subway line completed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1763"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1840"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1863"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1893"}, {"label": "E", "text": "1963"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How long was the first line?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 mile"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2 miles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4 miles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5 miles"}, {"label": "E", "text": "23 miles"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "On the first day, how many people traveled on the line?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "250"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "25,000"}, {"label": "E", "text": "30,000"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The first line was built using what method?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Trench digging"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pneumatic drilling"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dynamite explosion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Deep tube digging"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Cut and cover"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "After 30 years, London’s subway system had extended to _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 kilometers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15 kilometers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50 kilometers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "80 kilometers"}, {"label": "E", "text": "180 kilometers"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, \nthe brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely\nmanifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose \nheart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift \nupon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was,\nhe announced a contest: whoever first brought back \na glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun \nand Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf \nor blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking \nthe precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently \nwith a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply\nwringing out the fabric over her glass. Proud of all his students, \nand loving them like his own children, Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts. He turned the dew Ream Eyso \ncollected into a diamond axe, Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger, and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball \nunlike anything ever seen. Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous \nand decided he must have Mekhala’s prize. He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess\nso they could get the precious gem. But after she rejected their advances \nand flew off, Ream Eyso resolved \nto take the crystal ball by force. Ream Eyso flew through the air \nin search of Moni Mekhala, propelled on by a jealous rage. On his way, he encountered Vorachhun \nand attacked him, knowing that the righteous prince would\nnever allow him to steal the crystal. The demon gained the upper hand \nin the heat of battle, and hurled Vorachhun \nagainst the side of a mountain. Sure of Vorachhun’s death, Ream Eyso continued his search\nuntil he finally found Moni Mekhala. He demanded that she \nand her friends either submit to him, the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students \nand rightful master of the crystal ball, or die like Vorachhun. Mekhala, without fear, \nrefused and flew off into the clouds, hoping to draw the demon away\nfrom her friends. Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through\nnimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit. Once far enough away, \nMekhala confronted her pursuer. Ream Eyso made one last demand \nbut the goddess remained unfazed. Enraged, he began \nto swing his diamond axe. Before he could hurl the weapon,\nMekhala threw her crystal into the air. As it climbed the height of the sky, it emitted powerful flashes \nof lightning that blinded the demon. Ream Eyso let his axe loose \nin wild desperation. As the weapon flew through the air \nit cut through clouds, creating deep, rolling peals of thunder. And when the lightning and thunder mixed, precious seeds \nof water fell from heaven: rain. Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, \nnow blind and impotent without his axe. She pondered what\nshe should do to the murderer. Remembering the kindness \nand love of her teacher, Moni Mekhala chose compassion \nand flew into the sky. Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his \nstrength, found his axe, and followed her. Thunder, lightning, and rain continued \nto dance across the earth.

But this would’ve come as a great surprise\nto the millions of people who lived in the Roman Empire up\nthrough the Middle Ages. This medieval Roman Empire, which we usually refer \nto today as the Byzantine Empire, began in 330 CE. That’s when Constantine,\nthe first Christian emperor, moved the capital of the Roman Empire \nto a new city called Constantinople, which he founded on the site of the\nancient Greek city Byzantion. When the Visigoths sacked Rome in 410 and the Empire’s western provinces \nwere conquered by barbarians, Constantine’s Eastern capital remained \nthe seat of the Roman emperors. There, generations of emperors ruled \nfor the next 11 centuries. Sharing continuity with \nthe classical Roman Empire gave the Byzantine empire a technological\nand artistic advantage over its neighbors, whom Byzantines considered barbarians. In the ninth century, \nvisitors from beyond the frontier were astonished \nat the graceful stone arches and domes of the imperial palace in Constantinople. A pair of golden lions flanked \nthe imperial throne. A hidden organ would make the lions \nroar as guests fell on their knees. Golden birds\nsung from a nearby golden tree. Medieval Roman engineers \neven used hydraulic engines to raise the imperial throne \nhigh into the air. Other inherited aspects \nof ancient Roman culture could be seen in emperors’ clothing, from traditional military garb to togas, and in the courts, which continued to use Roman law. Working-class Byzantines would’ve also \nhad similar lives to their Ancient Roman counterparts; many farmed or plied a specific trade, such as ceramics, leatherworking, fishing, weaving, or manufacturing silk. But, of course, the Byzantine Empire didn’t just rest \non the laurels of Ancient Rome. Their artists innovated, creating vast \nmosaics and ornate marble carvings. Their architects constructed\nnumerous churches, one of which, called Hagia Sophia, had a dome so high it was said to be\nhanging on a chain from heaven. The Empire was also home to great\nintellectuals such as Anna Komnene. As imperial princess in the 12th century, Anna dedicated her life \nto philosophy and history. Her account of her father’s reign\nis historians’ foremost source for Byzantine political history \nat the time of the first crusade. Another scholar, Leo the Mathematician, invented a system of beacons that ran the\nwidth of the empire— what’s now Greece and Turkey. Stretching more than 700 kilometers, this system allowed the edge of the Empire\nto warn the emperor of invading armies within one hour\nof sighting them at the border. But their advances couldn’t \nprotect the Empire forever. In 1203, an army of French \nand Venetian Crusaders made a deal with a man \nnamed Alexios Angelos. Alexios was the son of a deposed emperor, and promised the crusaders vast riches and support to help him retake \nthe throne from his uncle. Alexios succeeded, but after a year, the population rebelled and Alexios \nhimself was deposed and killed. So Alexios’s unpaid army turned \ntheir aggression on Constantinople. They lit massive fires, which destroyed countless works of ancient\nand medieval art and literature, leaving about one-third \nof the population homeless. The city was reclaimed 50 years later \nby the Roman Emperor Michael Palaiologos, but his restored Empire never regained\nall the territory the Crusaders had conquered. Finally, in 1453, Ottoman Emperor Mehmed\nthe Conqueror captured Constantinople, bringing a conclusive end \nto the Roman Empire. Despite the Ottoman conquest, many Greek-speaking inhabitants \nof the Eastern Mediterranean continued to call themselves Romans \nuntil the early 21st century. In fact, it wasn’t until the Renaissance that the term “Byzantine Empire” \nwas first used. For Western Europeans, the Renaissance was about \nreconnecting with the wisdom of antiquity. And since the existence of a\nmedieval Roman Empire suggested there were Europeans \nwho’d never lost touch with antiquity, Western Europeans wanted to draw \nclear lines between the ages. To better distinguish the classical, \nLatin-speaking, pagan Roman Empire from the medieval, \nGreek-speaking, Christian Roman Empire, scholars renamed \nthe latter group Byzantines. And thus, 100 years after it had\nfallen, the Byzantine Empire was born."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When did the Byzantine Empire begin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "125 CE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "130 CE"}, {"label": "C", "text": "350 CE"}, {"label": "D", "text": "535 CE"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Whose historical work became the foremost source for Byzantine political history during the First Crusade?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Anna Komnene"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gerda Lerner"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anyte of Tegea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cleopatra"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Alexios Angelos created an alliance with ______ crusaders to depose his uncle.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "German and Greek"}, {"label": "B", "text": "French and Venetian"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Persian and English"}, {"label": "D", "text": "German and French"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When did Mehmed the Conqueror capture Constantinople?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1453"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1543"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1210"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1109"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The term \"Byzantine Empire\" was first used during ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Middle Ages"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Second Crusade"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yesterday"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Renaissance"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 89, "lesson": 5, "title": "What causes body odor? - Mel Rosenberg", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-body-odor-mel-rosenberg", "transcript": {"en": "A pungent blend of onions, cheese,\nand cat urine with hints of... is that…wet goat? Most of us don’t need more than one whiff to identify that generally unpleasant, \ncharacteristic smell we call body odor. But it’s a surprisingly complex phenomenon influenced by our genetic makeup, \nage, diet, and hygiene. So what is this odor, exactly? Where does it come from? And can we do anything about it? To start, you just need two things \nto produce that familiar scent: your armpit’s own secretions and the bacteria that feed on them. Most people associate \nbody odor with sweat, and it’s an important piece of the puzzle. Your body has millions of sweat glands, \nand they come in two major types: eccrine glands are found \nall over your skin and secrete mainly water and salt. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, \ndevelop at puberty in your armpits and a few other places on your body. The sweat they secrete \nis full of proteins and fats. By themselves, \nthese secretions are usually odorless. That’s where bacteria come in. Every square centimeter of our bodies \nis covered with thousands of bacteria. Many microorganisms thrive \nin moist environments, like our armpits. There, you can find about a million \nbacteria per square centimeter, one of the highest concentrations \nanywhere on the skin. Lurking in this throng of microorganisms \nare species of Corynebacteria, Staphylococci, Micrococci, and others. When these bacteria feed on the proteins \nand fats in apocrine sweat, they turn the odorless compounds into\nnew ones that can smell very unpleasant. Some of the worst offenders may be \nsulfur-containing chemicals; those give body odor its oniony aroma. Carboxylic acids are in the mix, too, \nadding notes of cheese. These molecules waft up from the armpit \nand can be sucked directly into our noses, where they’re trapped and detected \nby an array of specialized receptors. Those can recognize odor molecules at concentrations \nof less than one in a million. So what determines how strong \nyour body odor might be? It depends on the resident microbial\npopulations in your armpit, and the nutrients that \nyour glands provide them with. Your genes help determine \nwhat compounds you produce, and in what quantity, so everyone has a slightly different set. In fact, a gene variant that virtually \neliminates body odor is common in people of East Asian descent. Adrenaline increases the ratio \nof apocrine to eccrine sweat, so body odor can be more intense\nwhen you’re nervous. Bacterial composition and concentration \nalso varies between individuals and plays a part. Even what you eat can have \na small effect on how you smell. So how can we deal with body odor? Washing the armpits with soap and water \nhelps but won’t remove all the bacteria since many are buried \nin deeper layers of the skin. Deodorants, however, inhibit bacterial \nactivity and mask odors at the same time. Antiperspirants work by forming tiny\ngel plugs that block sweat glands, drying out the armpits. While we continue to battle body odor, \nscientists are trying to understand it. We don’t know why the brain often interprets these particular \nodors as off-putting.

The Peloponnesian War is being fought between the city-states of Athens and\nSparta, as well as their allies. The Athenians can’t match the formidable \nSpartan army on land. So they’ve abandoned the countryside and moved inside the walls surrounding \ntheir city and port, now provisioned by a superior fleet \nand extensive maritime empire. The cramped conditions have taken a toll and a recent plague wiped out \na third of the population. But city life goes on. Archias and Dexileia live \nin the center of Athens. As a painter of high-class pottery, Archias is relatively well-off and takes \ngreat interest in the city’s affairs. Dexileia, on the other hand, can't\nparticipate in politics or own property. The couple are grateful to the gods that \nthree of their four children, a son and two daughters, have survived past infancy. Many parents see daughters as a liability since they require dowries \nto find husbands. But Archias is confident that his wealth will allow him to make good matches\nfor them without going bankrupt. Like many Athenians, \nthe family owns slaves. Originally from Thrace,\nthey were captured in war. Thratta does most of the housework \nand helps raise the children. Philon is a paidagôgos, who supervises the son’s education, \nteaching him reading and writing. Archias is up early because there’s \na meeting of the Ekklêsia, the assembly of citizens, taking place at dawn. Before setting out, he burns incense and pours a libation at the small shrine \nin the courtyard on behalf of his entire household. Dexileia will remain at home all day, \nteaching her daughters domestic skills. Later, she’ll retire to the inner \ncourtyard for some fresh air. When Archias arrives at the agora, the civic and commercial heart \nof the city, he finds the square swarming \nwith his fellow citizens, native-born adult males who \nhave completed military training. Attached to the central monument is \na noticeboard with the meeting’s agenda. Today, there’s only one item \nof discussion: what to do with the people of Mytilene, a city on the island of Lesbos where a revolt against Athenian rule \nhas just been put down. The meeting takes place on a hill west \nof the acropolis known as the Pnyx. The word means “tightly packed,\" and the crowd of 5,000 citizens \nmakes it clear why. The heralds purify the hill by sprinkling \nits boundary with pig’s blood and call for order. As everyone sits on benches \nfacing the platform, the presiding officer opens the meeting \nwith the words: “Tis agoreuein bouleutai?” “Who wishes to address the assembly?” One by one, citizens speak, some advising \nmercy, others bent on vengeance. A motion is proposed to execute \nall the Mytileneans and enslave their women and children because they betrayed their Athenian \nallies during a time of war. A majority raises their right hands \nin favor. Once the meeting’s over, Archias heads \nback to the agora to buy food and wine. Hundreds have gathered there \nto discuss the results, many unhappy with the decision. When Archias returns home, \nhe tells Dexileia about the debate. She thinks that killing the innocent \nas well as the guilty is harsh and counterproductive, and tells him as much. Around dusk, Archias goes to \na friend’s house for a symposium. The nine men drink wine and\ndiscuss the meeting well into the night. Archias shares his wife’s opinion urging \nmercy, and his friends eventually agree. Before dawn, something \nunprecedented happens. Heralds circulate throughout Athens announcing the council \nhas called another meeting. The second debate is equally heated, but a new resolution, \nto execute only the leaders of the revolt, narrowly passes. Yet there’s a problem – a ship with orders to carry out \nthe first resolution was dispatched the previous day. And so another ship quickly sets sail \nto countermand the order – a race of democracy against time."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who teaches Archias’s children?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Archias"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dexileia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thratta"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Philon"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A hired tutor"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Where did the Assembly vote?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "On the Acropolis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the Forum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the Agora"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In the Peloponnese"}, {"label": "E", "text": "On the Pnyx"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What did Archias do before setting out for the Ekklêsia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shave"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pour a drink offering to the gods"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Walk his dog"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sacrifice a chicken"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Read the agenda of the Ekklêsia"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who teaches Archias’s son?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Archias"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dexileia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thratta"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Philon"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A hired tutor"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How did Archias find husbands for his daughters?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By giving them an education"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By using the services of a matchmaker"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By providing them with dowries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By praying to the gods"}, {"label": "E", "text": "By getting them good jobs"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where is Mytilene?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To the south of Athens"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the Peloponnese"}, {"label": "C", "text": "On the coast of Turkey"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In Italy"}, {"label": "E", "text": "On the island of Lesbos"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 89, "lesson": 8, "title": "5 dangerous things you should let your kids do", "category": "Teaching & Education", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/MlRn8Y1O", "transcript": {"en": "Welcome to \"Five Dangerous Things\nYou Should Let Your Children Do.\" I don't have children. I borrow my friends' children, so -- (Laughter) take all this advice with a grain of salt. I'm Gever Tulley. I'm a contract computer\nscientist by trade, but I'm the founder of something\ncalled the Tinkering School. It's a summer program\nwhich aims to help kids learn how to build the things\nthat they think of. So we build a lot of things, and I do put power tools\ninto the hands of second-graders. So if you're thinking about sending\nyour kid to Tinkering School, they do come back bruised,\nscraped and bloody. (Laughter) You know, we live in a world that's subjected to ever more\nstringent child safety regulations. There doesn't seem to be\nany limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get. We put suffocation warnings\non every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States, or for sale with an item\nin the United States. We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot. And we seem to think that any item\nsharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10. So where does this trend stop? When we round every corner\nand eliminate every sharp object, every pokey bit in the world, then the first time that kids\ncome in contact with anything sharp, or not made out of round plastic, they'll hurt themselves with it. So, as the boundaries\nof what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller, we cut off our children\nfrom valuable opportunities to learn how to interact\nwith the world around them. And despite all of our best\nefforts and intentions, kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous\nthing they can, in whatever environment they can. (Laughter) So despite the provocative title, this presentation is really about safety, and about some simple things\nthat we can do to raise our kids to be creative, confident and in control\nof the environment around them. And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress. The book is called \"50 Dangerous Things.\" This is \"Five Dangerous Things.\" Thing number one: Play with fire. Learning to control one of the most\nelemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment\nin any child's personal history. Whether we remember it or not, it's the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things. These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity\nto play with it. So, playing with fire. This is like one of the great things\nwe ever discovered, fire. From playing with it, they learn\nsome basic principles about fire, about intake, combustion, exhaust. These are the three working\nelements of fire that you have to have\nfor a good, controlled fire. And you can think of the open-pit\nfire as a laboratory. You don't know what they're going\nto learn from playing with it. Let them fool around with it\non their own terms and trust me, they're going to learn things that you can't get out of playing\nwith Dora the Explorer toys. (Laughter) Number two: Own a pocketknife. Pocketknives are kind of drifting\nout of our cultural consciousness, which I think is a terrible thing. (Laughter) Your first pocketknife\nis like the first universal tool that you're given. You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar, it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah. And it's a powerful and empowering tool. And in a lot of cultures\nthey give knives -- like, as soon as they're\ntoddlers, they have knives. These are Inuit children\ncutting whale blubber. I first saw this in a Canadian\nFilm Board film when I was 10, and it left a lasting impression, to see babies playing with knives. And it shows that kids can develop\nan extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age. You lay down a couple\nof very simple rules -- always cut away from your body,\nkeep the blade sharp, never force it -- and these are things kids\ncan understand and practice with. And yeah, they're going to cut themselves. I have some terrible scars on my legs\nfrom where I stabbed myself. But you know, they're young.\nThey heal fast. (Laughter) Number three: Throw a spear. It turns out that our brains\nare actually wired for throwing things, and like muscles, if you don't\nuse parts of your brain, they tend to atrophy over time. But when you exercise them, any given muscle adds strength\nto the whole system, and that applies to your brain, too. So practicing throwing things\nhas been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes, which have to do with\nvisual acuity, 3D understanding, and structural problem solving, so it helps develop their visualization\nskills and their predictive ability. And throwing is a combination\nof analytical and physical skill, so it's very good for that kind\nof whole-body training. These kinds of target-based practices\nalso help kids develop attention and concentration skills, so those are great. Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances. There is a world of interesting things\ninside your dishwasher. Next time you're about\nto throw out an appliance, don't throw it out. Take it apart with your kid, or send him to my school,\nand we'll take it apart with them. Even if you don't know what the parts are, puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense\nthat they can take things apart, and no matter how complex they are, they can understand parts of them. And that means that eventually,\nthey can understand all of them. It's a sense of knowability,\nthat something is knowable. So these black boxes that we live with\nand take for granted are actually complex things\nmade by other people, and you can understand them. Number five: Two-parter. Break the Digital\nMillennium Copyright Act. (Laughter) There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit\nhow we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case,\ndigital media. It's a very simple exercise: Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD, then rip the CD to an MP3,\nand play it on your very same computer. You've just broken a law. Technically, the RIAA\ncould come and prosecute you. It's an important lesson\nfor kids to understand, that some of these laws\nget broken by accident, and that laws have to be interpreted. That's something we often\ntalk about with the kids when we're fooling around with things\nand breaking them open, and taking them apart\nand using them for other things. And also when we go out and drive a car. Driving a car is a really empowering act\nfor a young child, so this is the alternate -- (Laughter) For those of you who aren't comfortable\nactually breaking the law, you can drive a car with your child. This is a great stage for a kid. This happens about the same time that they get latched onto\nthings like dinosaurs, these big things in the outside world, that they're trying to get a grip on. A car is a similar object,\nand they can get in a car and drive it. And that really gives them\na handle on a world in a way that they don't often\nhave access to. And it's perfectly legal. Find a big empty lot,\nmake sure there's nothing in it, and that it's on private property,\nand let them drive your car. It's very safe actually. And it's fun for the whole family. (Laughter) Let's see, I think that's it.\nThat's number five and a half.

{"page": 89, "lesson": 9, "title": "The science of skin - Emma Bryce", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-skin-emma-bryce", "transcript": {"en": "Between you and the rest of the world \nlies an interface that makes up 16% of your physical weight. This is your skin, the largest organ \nin your body: laid out flat, it would cover close to \n1.7 square meters of ground. Its purpose may seem obvious—\nto keep our insides in. But a look beyond the surface reveals that it plays a surprising \nnumber of roles in our lives. First, the basics. Skin is the foundation \nof the integumentary system, which also incorporates your hair, \nnails, and specialized glands and nerves. Made up of three layers, the epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis, skin’s thickness varies \nfrom 0.5 millimeters at its thinnest and up to four millimeters \nat its thickest. It also carries out three key functions: protecting, regulating, and sensing the world beyond its limits. On a daily basis, its huge surface \nprocesses hundreds, if not thousands, of physical sensations, relying mostly on large, \npressure-sensitive skin components called Merkel cells. In your fingertips alone, there are 750 Merkel cells \nper each square-centimeter of skin, coupled with over 2,500 receptors\nthat give you your sense of touch. This surface is also the body’s first \nmajor line of defense. Without it, you’d be a soggy mass \nof tissue and fluids, fatally exposed to the elements. Skin effectively seals off your insides and also absorbs pressure and shock with flexible collagen \nthat makes up most of its dermal layer. The epidermis is made up mainly \nof skin cells called keratinocytes that are completely replaced \nevery four weeks. As new cells form at the base of the\nepidermis, older ones are pushed up. When these cells move upwards, they’re filled with a hardened protein \ncalled keratin. Once they reach the surface, they form a tightly-overlapping, \nwaterproof layer that’s difficult for invading \nmicrobes to breach. Any harmful microbes that make it \ninto the epidermis will encounter Langerhans cells. This group of protective skin cells \ndetects invaders and communicates their presence \nto resident immune system T-cells, which react by launching \nan immune response. A crucial feature of this immune defense is the several thousand \nspecies of microorganisms that inhabit the planes, folds, and crevices of your skin. These microbes, \nwhich include bacteria and fungi, thrive in the sebum, an oily substance that’s secreted \nonto the skin’s surface by sebaceous glands nestled\ninside the dermis. These skin microbes keep the immune system\nin a state of constant surveillance, ensuring that it’s ready to react \nif the body really is at risk. Beyond this protective role, your skin is also a sensory organ that\nhelps regulate your body’s temperature, two roles that are closely interlinked. Nerves detect whether your skin \nis warm or cold and communicate that\ninformation to your brain. In return, the brain instructs\nlocalized blood vessels to either expand if the body is too warm, releasing heat from \nthe blood through the skin, or to constrict if the body is cold,\nwhich retains heat. At any given time, up to 25% of the body's\nblood is circulating through the dermis, making this process extremely efficient. Under warm conditions, the skin’s sweat glands will secrete sweat\nvia ducts onto the surface, transferring heat out of the body. Hair can also be stimulated\nto conserve or release body warmth. The average human \nhas 5 million hair follicles embedded everywhere on the body except the palms of your hands \nand soles of your feet. Ninety to 150,000 of those \nare on your scalp, where they help shield\nthe large surface area of your head from physical damage and sunburn. When you're cold, tiny muscles \ncalled arrector pilli cause hair to stand upright\nacross the body. That’s the phenomenon known as goosebumps\nand it traps body heat close to your skin.

He was known in Greek mythology \nas a rogue ruler whose antics bemused his people \nand distracted the gods. Midas spent his days \nin a stupor of splendor, spoiling himself and his beloved daughter\nand gorging himself on feasts and wine. Unsurprisingly, he felt \nan affinity with Dionysus, god of wine, carnival, and performance. One day, Midas discovered a satyr dozing in his rose garden and drunk \non more than the scent of flowers. Midas recognized the satyr \nas one of Dionysus’s followers and let him nurse \nhis hangover at the palace. Pleased with the king’s hospitality,\nDionysus offered to grant him one wish. Midas cast a greedy eye \nover his surroundings. Despite the luxury in which he lived, no amount of precious jewels, finest silk \nor splendid decor felt like enough. His life, he thought, was lacking luster;\nwhat he needed was more gold. The god sent the power to turn anything\nthe king touched to gold surging through Midas. Ecstatic, he turned to his possessions. At his lightest touch, \nthe palace walls transformed, stone statues shone, and goblets glittered. He galloped through his home in a frenzy, handling each item until \nit took on a lustrous sheen. Soon the palace heaved with gold, and Midas’s delirious\nlaughter echoed off the walls. Exhausted and hungry from his rampage, Midas picked up a bunch of grapes from \nhis newly gilded fruit bowl. But he nearly shattered his teeth, for the fruit had turned \nto metal in his mouth. When he picked up a loaf of bread, \nthe crumbs hardened in his hand. Flinging himself onto \nhis bed in frustration, Midas discovered his plush pillows \nhad morphed into solid gold. Hearing his cries of frustration, \nhis daughter entered the room. But when Midas reached out to her, he saw with horror that he had frozen her \ninto a golden statue. Horrified at what he had done, Midas begged the gods \nto rid him of his power. Taking pity on the foolish king, Dionysus told Midas to wash \nhis hands in the River Pactolus. When Midas reached into the river, \nthe gold drained from his fingertips. Midas returned home \nto find his daughter alive and his palace back to normal, \nand he rejoiced. You’d think he would’ve learned \nhis lesson, but just a few weeks later,\nMidas blundered again, insulting the music and sun god Apollo \nwhen he declared Pan a greater musician. Apollo scornfully declared that the king \nmust have the ears of an ass to make such a misjudgment,\nand transformed Midas accordingly. Once again regretting his behavior, Midas kept his hairy ears \nhidden in public. They were seen only by his barber, who was sworn to secrecy during \na very awkward grooming session. The barber stifled his laughter \nand fought the desire to tell someone, yet the secret consumed him. One day, he walked outside the city \nand dug a hole in the ground. Plunging his head into the earth, the desperate barber whispered,\n“Midas has ass’s ears.” Soon after, a clump of reeds sprang up in the spot where the barber \nhad buried his words. When the wind blew, they carried the \nechoes of his whisper through the breeze: \"Midas has ass’s ears.\" At the sound, donkeys in the fields raised\ntheir heads in recognition and people chuckled to themselves \nat the follies of their king. With his golden touch and ass’s ears, \nMidas was not the most respected ruler.

It’d all started when Thor, along with his fleet-footed human servant\nThjalfi and Loki, the trickster god, set out on a journey to Jotunheim, \nland of the giants. Along the way, they’d met \na giant named Skrymir, who offered to accompany them and\neven carry their provisions in his bag. But when they made camp,\nSkrymir dozed off and Thor couldn’t untie the sack. Frustrated and hungry, Thor tried \nto wake the giant three times by striking his head with his hammer \nMjolnir as hard as he could. But each time, Skrymir thought \nit was only a falling acorn and went back to sleep. The next morning, Skrymir departed and eventually, the travelers reached \na massive fortress called Utgard. Inside the long hall, \nthey met the king of giants, Utgard-Loki, who greeted his guests with a challenge: each of them was to prove they were \nthe best at some particular skill. Loki went first, declaring himself \nthe world’s fastest eater. To test him, the king summoned \nhis servant Logi and the two were placed at either \nend of a long trough stuffed with food. Loki ate his way inward \nwith blinding speed. But when the contestants \nmet in the center, Loki saw that his adversary \nhad not only eaten just as much food, but also the bones \nand even the trough itself. Next was Thjalfi, who could \noutrun anything in the wild. The king summoned an ethereal-looking \ngiant named Hugi, who outraced Thjalfi easily. But the boy would not give up \nand demanded a rematch. This time, Thjalfi finished close behind and the king admitted he’d never \nseen a human run so fast. Thjalfi tried a third time, \nrunning like his life depended on it, but Hugi was even faster than before. Finally, it was Thor’s turn. The king offered him a drinking horn, saying all his men \ncould drain it in two gulps. Thor raised it to his lips and drank the surprisingly \ncold and salty mead in the longest gulp he could muster. Then a second. Then a third. But the level of the mead \nin the horn was only slightly lowered. To test Thor’s renowned strength, the king\noffered a seemingly easy challenge: lift his pet cat off the ground. But this cat was as tall as Thor. Every time he tried to lift it, \nit arched its back, and straining with all his godly might, \nhe only managed to lift one paw. Enraged, Thor demanded \nto wrestle any of the giants. The king summoned \nthe giants’ old nursemaid, Elli. Though the woman looked frail, \nThor couldn’t overpower her and grew weaker the longer he struggled,\nuntil he was brought to one knee. The three companions prepared \nto leave, disappointed and humbled. But as the king escorted them out, he revealed that nothing in the castle \nhad been what it seemed. Loki lost the eating contest because \nhis opponent Logi was wildfire itself, devouring everything in its path. Thjalfi couldn’t outrun Hugi because\nHugi was the embodiment of thought, always faster than action. And even Thor couldn’t defeat Elli, \nor old age, which weakens everyone eventually. As for the other challenges, \nthey had also been illusions. The drinking horn \nwas filled with the ocean, and Thor had drained\nenough to cause the tides. The cat was the serpent \nthat encircles the world, and Thor’s efforts shifted the earth. And Skrymir had been \nUtgard-Loki in disguise, deflecting Thor’s hammer-blows to form\nvalleys in the surrounding mountains. The giant congratulated \nthem on their prowess, which so frightened him he would \nnever allow them in his land again. Thor and his companions failed \nthe challenges presented to them.

Over an area of more \nthan 900,000 square kilometers, its people built massive \nadministrative centers, temples, and extensive road \nand canal systems. They did so in an inhospitable, \nextreme terrain, all without the use of wheels, \nhorses, iron, or even written language. Yet within 100 years of its rise \nin the fifteenth century, the Inca Empire would be no more. According to legend, the ancestors of the Inca rulers \nwere created by the sun god Inti, and they emerged\nfrom a cave called Tambo Toco. Leading four brothers \nand four sisters was Ayar Manco, who carried a golden staff \nwith instructions to find the place where \nit would sink into the ground, showing fertile soil. After many adventures \nand extensive searching, Ayar Manco and his siblings \nreached the Cuzco Valley, where the staff pierced the ground. After fighting off the fierce \nlocal native population, they founded their capital, and Ayar Manco became Manco Capac, \nthe first Sapa Inca, or king of the Incas. Archaeological evidence suggests that the Incas first settled \nin this valley around 1200 CE. They remained a small kingdom until 1438, when they were nearly overrun \nby the neighboring Chanka tribe. The Inca king at this time, Viracocha, \nand his designated heir fled in fear, but one of his other sons remained and successfully rallied \nthe city’s defenses. For his military skill, he became \nthe ninth Inca ruler, assuming the name of Pachacuti, \nor \"Cataclysm.\" Pachacuti expanded Inca rule \nthroughout the Andes mountains, transforming the kingdom into \nan empire through extensive reforms. The empire’s territory was reorganized \nas Tahuantinsuyu, or \"four quarters,\" with four divisions ruled \nby governors reporting to the king. Although the Inca had no writing, they used a complex system \nof knotted strings called quipu to record numbers \nand perhaps other information. A decimal-based bureaucracy \nenabled systematic and efficient taxation \nof the empire’s subjects. In return, the empire provided security, \ninfrastructure, and sustenance, with great storehouses containing \nnecessities to be used when needed. Great terraces and irrigation works \nwere built and various crops were grown in \nat different altitudes to be transported all over the empire. And it was during Pachacuti’s reign that the famous estate \nof Machu Picchu was constructed. Pachacuti’s son Topa Inca continued \nthe empire’s military expansion, and he eventually became ruler\nin 1471 CE. By the end of his reign, the empire \ncovered much of western South America. Topa’s son Huayna Capac \nsucceeded him in 1493. But the new ruler’s distant military \ncampaigns strained the social fabric. And in 1524, Huayna Capac \nwas stricken by fever. Spanish conquistadors had arrived \nin the Caribbean some time before, bringing diseases to which \nthe native peoples had no resistance. Millions died in the outbreak, including Huayna Capac\nand his designated heir. The vacant throne ignited a civil war\nbetween two of the surviving brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, greatly weakening the empire. In 1532, after finally winning \nthe Inca civil war, Atahualpa and his army \nencountered the European invaders. Although greatly outnumbered, Francisco Pizarro \nand his small group of conquistadors stunned the king’s much larger force \nwith guns and horses, neither of which they had seen before. Atahualpa was taken captive \nand killed about a year later. The Spanish conquerors \nwere awed by the capital of Cuzco. Pizarro described it as so beautiful that\n“it would be remarkable even in Spain.” Though the capital had fallen and the native population had been\ndestroyed by civil war and disease, some Incas fell back to \na new capital at Vilcabamba and resisted for the next 40 years. But by 1572, the Spaniards had destroyed \nall remaining resistance along with much of the Incas’ physical \nand cultural legacy.

The powerful gods usually changed \ntheir own forms at will, but for mortals, the mutations \nwere often unwanted. One such unnerving transformation \nbefell the spinner Arachne. Arachne was the daughter \nof a tradesman who spent his days dying cloth \nthe deepest shades of purple. She had a flair for spinning \nthe finest threads, weaving them into flowing fabric, and creating magnificent tapestries. People flocked to watch her hands \nflying across her loom, as if thread sprung directly \nfrom her fingertips. But as praise for her work grew, \nso did her pride. Arachne could often be heard \nboasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed \nanyone else’s—mortal or divine. She refused to see weaving \nas a gift from the gods. Rather, she flaunted it \nas her own personal genius. Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom \nand crafts, Athena, overheard Arachne \nmaking these claims. Planning to teach \nthe ungrateful girl a lesson, Athena disguised herself as an old woman\nand stole amongst the mortals. She berated Arachne in public— how dare the weaver claim\nherself greater than the gods? But Arachne only laughed, \nbarely looking up from her loom. Provoked, the old woman threw off\nher cloak to reveal her true form. If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods, Athena would challenge her \nto a contest directly. Masking her shock at the appearance \nof the grey-eyed goddess, Arachne accepted the challenge. Athena drew up her own glittering loom \nas a great crowd gathered to watch. The weavers began, \neyes fixed and shuttles blurring. Athena conjured \nwisps of cloud from above and slender threads of grass \nfrom below in a spectacle of strength. She wove tremendous scenes \nthat showed the power of the gods: Poseidon riding the waves, Zeus firing thunderbolts, and Apollo hurtling across the sky. In Athena’s splendid tapestry, \nthe glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life. But Arachne had no interest \nin boosting godly egos. Her tapestry showed the gods\nabusing their power: squabbling amongst themselves, drinking and bragging, and meddling in the lives of mortals. She represented Zeus as a philanderer,\ntransfiguring himself to ensnare women: a swan for Leda, a bull for Europa, a shower of gold for Danae. Arachne then turned\nto the misdemeanors of other gods, from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone. Even though she cast the gods \nin the most unflattering light, Arachne’s work shone \nwith her dazzling skill. Her tapestry was almost alive, filled with movement \nand lustrous colors that winked triumphantly. When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably\nbetter and flagrantly subversive work, she flew into a rage \nand turned on the human weaver. Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body\nshrinking and contorting. Her fingers waved wildly \nas her arms stuck to her sides, and black hair\nsprouted all over her body. The goddess left Arachne with a single \nspool of thread unfurling from her belly, a slim reminder of her human talent. For challenging the assumption\nthat the gods were untouchable, Athena had shrunk her adversary \ninto the first spider.

{"page": 89, "lesson": 14, "title": "How did teeth evolve? - Peter S. Ungar", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-did-teeth-evolve-peter-s-ungar", "transcript": {"en": "You may take them for granted, \nbut your teeth are a marvel. They break up all your food \nover the course of your life, while being strong enough\nto withstand breakage themselves. And they’re formed using \nonly the raw materials from the food they grind down \nin the first place. What’s behind their impressive strength? Teeth rely on an ingenious structure \nthat makes them both hard and tough. Hardness can be thought of as the ability \nto resist a crack from starting, while toughness is what stops \nthe crack from spreading Very few materials have both properties. For instance, glass is hard but not tough, while leather is tough but not hard. Teeth manage both by having two layers: a hard external cap of enamel, made up\nalmost entirely of a calcium phosphate, and beneath it, \na tougher layer of dentin, partly formed from organic fibers \nthat make it flexible. This amazing structure is created \nby two types of cells: ameloblasts that secrete enamel and odontoblasts that secrete dentin. As they form teeth, \nodontoblasts move inward, while ameloblasts move out \nand slough off when they hit the surface. For enamel, this process produces long, \nthin strands, each about 60 nanometers in diameter. That’s one one-thousandth \nthe width of a human hair. Those are bundled into rods, \npacked together, tens of thousands per square millimeter, to form the shield-like enamel layer. Once this process is finished, \nyour enamel can’t repair itself again because all the cells \nthat make it are lost, so we’re lucky that enamel \ncan’t be easily destroyed. Odontoblasts use a more complex process,\nbut unlike ameloblasts, they stick around, continuing to secrete dentin \nthroughout your life. Despite the differences in teeth \nacross the mammalian order, the underlying process of tooth growth \nis the same whether it’s for lions, kangaroos, elephants, or us. What changes is how nature sculpts \nthe shape of the tooth, altering the folding and growth patterns to suit the distinct diets \nof different species. Cows have flat molar teeth with parallel \nridges for grinding tough grasses. Cats have sharp crested molars, \nlike blades, for shearing meat and sinew. Pigs have blunt, thick ones, \nuseful for crushing hard roots and seeds. The myriad molars of modern mammals can be traced back to a common form\ncalled “tribosphenic,\" which first appeared \nduring the dinosaur age. In the 19th Century, \npaleontologist Edward Drinker Cope developed the basic model \nfor how this form evolved. He hypothesized that \nit started with a cone-like tooth, as we see in many fishes, \namphibians, and reptiles. Small cusps were then added, \nso the tooth had three in a row, aligned front to back,\nand connected by crests. Over time, the cusps were pushed out \nof line to make triangular crowns. Adjacent teeth formed a continuous \nzigzag of crests for slicing and dicing. A low shelf then formed \nat the back of each set of teeth, which became a platform for crushing. As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar \nserved as the jumping-off point for the radiation of specialized\nforms to follow, each shaped by evolutionary needs. Straighten the crests \nand remove the shelf, and you’ve got the conveniently \nbladed teeth of cats and dogs. Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf, \nand you’ve got our human molars. A few additional tweaks get you \na horse or cow tooth. Some details in Cope’s intuitive\nhypothesis proved wrong.

But in the Irish genre of myth\nknown as Eachtraí, the journey to the other world\nends in a point of no return. While there are many different versions\nof the otherworld in Irish mythology, the most well-known example occurs\nin the story of Oisín. Oisín was the son of Fionn mac Cumhaill,\nthe leader of a group of pagan warriors known as the Fianna. As Oisín rode with his companions one day, he was visited by \nthe immortal princess Niamh. The two fell instantly in love and Niamh put Oisín onto her white horse and rode with him \nto the edge of the Irish sea. As they made for the horizon,\nthe riders sunk into a golden haze. They came to the shores of\nthe gleaming kingdom called Tír na nÓg. This was the home of the Tuatha Dé Danann,\nthe people who ruled Ancient Ireland long before Oisín's time. From the point of his arrival,\nOisín's every need was met. He married Niamh in a grand ceremony\nand was welcomed into her family. When he wished to hear music,\nhis ears filled with bewitching tones. When he hungered, golden plates\nappeared laden with fragrant food. He admired scenes of great beauty,\nand colors that he had no name for. All around him, the land and the people\nexisted in a state of unmoving perfection. But what Oisín didn't know was that\nTír na nÓg was the land of youth, in which time stood still\nand the people never aged. In his new home, Oisín continued\nto hunt and explore as he had in Ireland. But in the land of youth, he possessed\na strange, new invincibility. At the end of each day of adventuring, Oisín's wounds magically healed themselves\nas he slept in Niamh's arms. Although glory and pleasure\ncame easily to Oisín in the land of youth, he missed the Fianna\nand the adventures they had in Ireland. After three years in Tír na nÓg, he\nwas struck by a deep yearning for home. Before he embarked on his journey back,\nNiamh warned him that he must not alight from his horse\nto touch the earth with his own feet. When Oisín reached the shores of Ireland, it felt as if a shadow \nhad fallen over the world. On the hill where his father's palace lay,\nhe saw only a ruin strewn with weeds. His calls for his friends and family\nechoed from derelict walls. Horrified, Oisín rode until he came upon\na group of peasants working in the fields. They were struggling to remove \na boulder from their land, and forgetting Niamh's warning, Oisín leapt from his horse and rolled it\naway with his superhuman strength. The crowd's cheers soon\nturned into shrieks. In place of the youth was an old man\nwhose beard swept the ground and whose legs buckled under him. He cried out for Finn and the Fianna, but the people only recognized these names\nfrom the distant past of 300 years before. Time had betrayed Oisín and his return to mortal lands\nhad aged him irreversibly. Throughout Irish folklore, sightings of the land of youth\nhave been reported in the depths of wells, on the brink of the horizon, or in the gloom of caves.

The groom was Orpheus,\nthe greatest of all poets and musicians. The bride Eurydice, a wood nymph. Anyone could tell the couple \nwas truly and deeply in love. Suddenly, Eurydice stumbled, \nthen fell to the ground. By the time Orpheus reached her side,\nshe was dead, and the snake that had bitten \nher was slithering away through the grass. Following Eurydice’s funeral, Orpheus was overcome with a grief \nthe human world could not contain, and so he decided he would journey \nto the land of the dead, a place from which no living creature \nhad ever returned, to rescue his beloved. When Orpheus reached the gates of the\nunderworld, he began to strum his lyre. The music was so beautiful that Cerberus,\nthe three-headed dog who guards the dead, lay down as Orpheus passed. Charon, the ferry captain who charged \ndead souls to cross the River Styx, was so moved by the music that he brought \nOrpheus across free of charge. When Orpheus entered \nthe palace of Hades and Persephone, the king and queen of the dead, he began to sing. He sang of his love for Eurydice, \nand said she had been taken away too soon. The day would come when she, \nlike all living creatures, dwelled in the land of the\ndead for all eternity, so couldn’t Hades grant \nher just a few more years on Earth? In the moment after Orpheus finished, \nall hell stood still. Sisyphus no longer rolled his rock\nup the hill. Tantalus did not reach for the water \nhe would never be allowed to drink. Even the Furies, \nthe demonic goddesses of vengeance, wept. Hades and Persephone granted\nOrpheus’s plea, but on one condition. As he climbed back out of the underworld, he must not turn around to see \nif Eurydice was following behind him. If he did, she would return\nto the land of the dead forever. Orpheus began to climb. With each step, he worried more and more \nabout whether Eurydice was behind him. He heard nothing—\nwhere were her footsteps? Finally, just before he stepped out \nof the underworld and into the bright light of day, he gave into temptation. Orpheus tried to return to the underworld,\nbut was refused entry. Separated from Eurydice, Orpheus swore never\nto love another woman again. Instead, he sat in a grove of trees \nand sang songs of lovers. There was Ganymede, the beautiful boy \nwho Zeus made drink-bearer to the gods. There was Myrrah, who loved her father \nand was punished for it, and Pygmalion, who sculpted \nhis ideal woman out of ivory, then prayed to Venus \nuntil she came to life. And there was Venus herself, whose beautiful Adonis \nwas killed by a wild boar. It was as if Orpheus’s own love and loss had allowed him to see into \nthe hearts of gods and people everywhere. For some, however, poetry was not enough. A group of wild women called the Maenads could not bear the thought that a poet \nwho sang so beautifully of love would not love them. Their jealousy drove them to a frenzy \nand they destroyed poor Orpheus. The birds, nature’s singers, \nmourned Orpheus, as did the rivers, \nwho made music as they babbled. The world had lost two great souls. Orpheus and Eurydice had loved each other \nso deeply that when they were separated, Orpheus had understood \nthe pain and joys of lovers everywhere, and a new art form, \nthe love poem, was born. While the world wept, Orpheus found peace,\nand his other half, in the underworld. There, to this day, he walks with Eurydice\nalong the banks of the River Styx.

You wouldn’t even know it was there,\nif not for the red lump that appears, accompanied by a telltale itch. It’s a nuisance, but that bump \nis an important signal that you’re protected \nby your immune system, your body’s major safeguard \nagainst infection, illness, and disease. This system is a vast network of cells, \ntissues, and organs that coordinate your body’s defenses \nagainst any threats to your health. Without it, you’d be exposed to billions \nof bacteria, viruses, and toxins that could make something as minor\nas a paper cut or a seasonal cold fatal. The immune system relies on millions \nof defensive white blood cells, also known as leukocytes, that originate in our bone marrow. These cells migrate into the bloodstream\nand the lymphatic system, a network of vessels which helps \nclear bodily toxins and waste. Our bodies are teeming with leukocytes: there are between 4,000 \nand 11,000 in every microliter of blood. As they move around, leukocytes \nwork like security personnel, constantly screening the blood, \ntissues, and organs for suspicious signs. This system mainly relies \non cues called antigens. These molecular traces on the surface \nof pathogens and other foreign substances betray the presence of invaders. As soon as the leukocytes detect them, it takes only minutes for the body’s \nprotective immune response to kick in. Threats to our bodies are hugely variable, so the immune response \nhas to be equally adaptable. That means relying on many \ndifferent types of leukocytes to tackle threats in different ways. Despite this diversity, we classify \nleukocytes in two main cellular groups, which coordinate a two-pronged attack. First, phagocytes trigger \nthe immune response by sending macrophages \nand dendritic cells into the blood. As these circulate, they destroy\nany foreign cells they encounter, simply by consuming them. That allows phagocytes to identify the antigen on the invaders \nthey just ingested and transmit this information \nto the second major cell group orchestrating the defense, the lymphocytes. A group of lymphocyte cells called T-cells\ngo in search of infected body cells and swiftly kill them off. Meanwhile, B-cells and helper T-cells use the information gathered \nfrom the unique antigens to start producing special proteins \ncalled antibodies. This is the pièce de résistance: Each antigen has a unique, matching \nantibody that can latch onto it like a lock and key, and destroy the invading cells. B-cells can produce millions of these, which then cycle through the body \nand attack the invaders until the worst of the\nthreat is neutralized. While all of this is going on, \nfamiliar symptoms, like high temperatures and swelling, are actually processes designed \nto aid the immune response. A warmer body makes it harder for bacteria\nand viruses to reproduce and spread because they’re temperature-sensitive. And when body cells are damaged, they release chemicals that make fluid\nleak into the surrounding tissues, causing swelling. That also attracts phagocytes, which consume the invaders\nand the damaged cells. Usually, an immune response \nwill eradicate a threat within a few days. It won’t always stop you from getting ill,\nbut that’s not its purpose. Its actual job is to stop a threat from escalating to dangerous \nlevels inside your body. And through constant \nsurveillance over time, the immune system \nprovides another benefit: it helps us develop long-term immunity. When B- and T-cells identify antigens, they can use that information \nto recognize invaders in the future. So, when a threat revisits, the cells\ncan swiftly deploy the right antibodies to tackle it before it affects \nany more cells. That’s how you can develop immunity \nto certain diseases, like chickenpox. It doesn’t always work so well. Some people have autoimmune diseases, which trick the immune system into attacking the body’s own \nperfectly healthy cells. No one knows exactly what causes them, but these disorders sabotage \nthe immune system to varying degrees, and underlie problems like arthritis, Type I diabetes, and multiple sclerosis. For most individuals, however, a healthy immune system will successfully\nfight off an estimated 300 colds and innumerable other potential infections\nover the course of a lifetime. Without it, those threats would escalate \ninto something far more dangerous. So the next time you catch a cold \nor scratch a mosquito bite, think of the immune system. We owe it our lives."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The immune system is built on millions of cells called _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Blood cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Immune cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Leukocytes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lymph cells"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The _______ carry the leukocytes around the body.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The bloodstream"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The lymphatic system"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The nervous system"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a and b"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Phagocytes initially destroy invasive cells _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By alerting the immune system to their presence"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By consuming them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By alerting T-cells to their presence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By alerting B-cells to their presence"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "B-cells and T-cells fight off the threat by producing _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lymphocytes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Phagocytes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antibodies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Antigens"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Your immune system stops you from ever getting ill.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

The spinster wasting away \nin her tattered wedding dress. The stone-hearted miser plagued \nby the ghost of Christmas past. More than a century after his death, these remain recognizable figures\nfrom the work of Charles Dickens. So striking is his body of work \nthat it gave rise to its own adjective. But what are the features of Dickens's\nwriting that make it so special? Dickens’s fiction brims with anticipation through brooding settings, \nplot twists, and mysteries. These features of his work kept\nhis audience wanting more. When first published, \nhis stories were serialized, meaning they were released a few chapters\nat a time in affordable literary journals and only later reprinted as books. This prompted fevered speculation\nover the cliffhangers and revelations he devised. Serialization not only made fiction\navailable to a wider audience and kept them reading, but increased the hype\naround the author himself. Dickens became particularly popular\nfor his wit, which he poured into quirky characters\nand satiric scenarios. His characters exhibit the sheer\nabsurdity of human behavior, and their names often personify\ntraits or social positions, like the downtrodden Bob Cratchit, the groveling Uriah Heep, and the cheery Septimus Crisparkle. Dickens set these colorful characters\nagainst intricate social backdrops, which mimic the society he lived in. For instance, he often considered the changes brought about \nby the Industrial Revolution. During this period, the lower classes experienced \nsordid working and living conditions. Dickens himself experienced \nthis hardship as a child when he was forced to work in\na boot blacking factory after his father was sent \nto debtors' prison. This influenced his depiction\nof the Marshalsea prison in Little Dorrit, where the titular character cares\nfor her convict father. Prisons, orphanages, or slums\nmay seem grim settings for a story, but they allowed Dickens to shed light on how his society's \nmost invisible people lived. In Nicholas Nickleby, Nicholas takes a job with the schoolmaster\nWackford Squeers. He soon realizes that Squeers\nis running a scam where he takes unwanted children\nfrom their parents for a fee and subjects them to violence\nand deprivation. Oliver Twist also deals with the plight \nof children in the care of the state, illustrating the brutal conditions of\nthe workhouse in which Oliver pleads\nwith Mr. Bumble for food. When he flees to London, he becomes\nensnared in a criminal underworld. These stories frequently portray\nVictorian life as grimy, corrupt, and cruel. But Dickens also saw his time\nas one in which old traditions were fading away. London was becoming\nthe incubator of the modern world through new patterns in industry,\ntrade, and social mobility. Dickens's London is therefore\na dualistic space: a harsh world that is simultaneously\nfilled with wonder and possibility. For instance, the enigma \nof Great Expectations centers around the potential of Pip, an orphan plucked from obscurity\nby an anonymous benefactor and propelled into high society. In his search for purpose, Pip becomes the victim \nof other people’s ambitions for him and must negotiate with \na shadowy cast of characters. Like many of Dickens’s protagonists, poor Pip's position \nis constantly destabilized, just one of the reasons \nwhy reading Dickens is the best of times for the reader, while being the worst of times \nfor his characters. Dickens typically offered clear \nresolution by the end of his novels, – with the exception of\nThe Mystery of Edwin Drood. The novel details the disappearance of the\norphan Edwin under puzzling circumstances. However, Dickens died before the novel \nwas finished and left no notes resolving the mystery. Readers continue to passionately debate \nover who Dickens intended as the murderer, and whether Edwin Drood \nwas even murdered in the first place. Throughout many adaptations, literary homages, and the pages of his novels, Dickens’s sparkling language\nand panoramic worldview continue to resonate. Today, the adjective Dickensian often implies squalid working \nor living conditions. But to describe a novel as\nDickensian is typically high praise, as it suggests a story in which true \nadventure and discovery occur in the most unexpected places. Although he often explored bleak material, Dickens’s piercing wit never failed\nto find light in the darkest corners."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Serialized literature is ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Many short stories in one volume"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A book that is made into a television show"}, {"label": "C", "text": "One novel released a few chapters at a time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A series of novels about the same character"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "As a child, Dickens was ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A runaway"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A laborer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An aristocrat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A pickpocket"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In Dickens’ novels, London is: 1) A place in which everyone is equal 2) A dark and threatening city 3) A magical city 4) A place in which one can make their fortune", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Choices 1 and 2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Choices 2 and 4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Choices 3 and 4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above choices are correct"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The protagonist of Great Expectations is called ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oliver Twist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nicholas Nickleby"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pip"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fagin"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The murderer of Edwin Drood is ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Septimus Crispinkle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rosa Budd"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wackford Squeers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Most people thought the story\nso unusual that Humboldt made it up. But fish using electricity is more common\nthan you might think; and yes, electric eels are a type of fish. Underwater, where light is scarce, electrical signals offer ways\nto communicate, navigate, and find—plus, in rare cases, stun—prey. Nearly 350 species of fish\nhave specialized anatomical structures that generate \nand detect electrical signals. These fish are divided into two groups, depending on how much \nelectricity they produce. Scientists call the first group\nthe weakly electric fish. Structures near their tails \ncalled electric organs produce up to a volt of electricity,\nabout two-thirds as much as a AA battery. How does this work? The fish's brain sends a signal through\nits nervous system to the electric organ, which is filled with stacks of hundreds or thousands of disc-shaped \ncells called electrocytes. Normally, electrocytes pump out sodium\nand potassium ions to maintain a positive charge outside\nand negative charge inside. But when the nerve signal arrives\nat the electrocyte, it prompts the ion gates to open. Positively charged ions flow back in. Now, one face of the electrocyte\nis negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. But the far side \nhas the opposite charge pattern. These alternating charges \ncan drive a current, turning the electrocyte \ninto a biological battery. The key to these fish's powers \nis that nerve signals are coordinated to arrive at each cell \nat exactly the same time. That makes the stacks of electrocytes\nact like thousands of batteries in series. The tiny charges from each one\nadd up to an electrical field that can travel several meters. Cells called electroreceptors\nburied in the skin allow the fish to constantly sense\nthis field and the changes to it caused \nby the surroundings or other fish. The Peter’s elephantnose fish, \nfor example, has an elongated chin\ncalled a schnauzenorgan that's riddled in electroreceptors. That allows it to intercept signals\nfrom other fish, judge distances, detect the shape and size\nof nearby objects, and even determine whether\na buried insect is dead or alive. But the elephantnose\nand other weakly electric fish don't produce enough electricity\nto attack their prey. That ability belongs \nto the strongly electric fish, of which there are only \na handful of species. The most powerful strongly electric\nfish is the electric knife fish, more commonly known as the electric eel. Three electric organs span\nalmost its entire two-meter body. Like the weakly electric fish, the electric eel uses its signals\nto navigate and communicate, but it reserves its strongest \nelectric discharges for hunting using a two-phased attack that susses out\nand then incapacitates its prey. First, it emits two \nor three strong pulses, as much as 600 volts. These stimulate the prey's muscles,\nsending it into spasms and generating waves \nthat reveal its hiding place. Then, a volley of fast, \nhigh-voltage discharges causes even more intense \nmuscle contractions. The electric eel can also curl up\nso that the electric fields generated at each end \nof the electric organ overlap. The electrical storm eventually\nexhausts and immobilizes the prey, and the electric eel \ncan swallow its meal alive. The other two strongly electric fish\nare the electric catfish, which can unleash 350 volts with an electric organ \nthat occupies most of its torso, and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped\nelectric organs on either side of its head that produce as much as 220 volts. There is one mystery in the world\nof electric fish: why don't they electrocute themselves? It may be that the size \nof strongly electric fish allows them to withstand their own shocks, or that the current passes out \nof their bodies too quickly.

According to psychology the answer to that question may depend less on who you are as a person and more on how many people are with you at the time. In a strange paradox of human nature the more people there are in a group, the less likely anyone is to offer help. It's called the bystander effect, and it may be a roadblock that's keeping you from showing empathy When someone is in need people in large groups tend to feel that they don't need to do anything because someone else will take care of it. This is known as the diffusion of responsibility The end result is nobody does anything, and if you don't believe me I'll show you we started with a large group of 10 people and told them they were here today to see a product demonstration. So we're just basically looking for emotional reactions to certain products. We're not quite ready to go yet. So as you can see you have these surveys go ahead start filling them out take all the time you need with them. I am gonna go get the product and just Kinda start throwing it together, and then we're gonna begin sound good everyone? okay cool. Thanks Here's the thing though, everybody but one of these people wasn't in on it We gave her a 10-minute window where she could offer to help. Let's see if she comes to my rescue We repeated this a few more times with varying results. Next we tried it with a group of five. Oh geez So far it's not looking good for people in general Are we just plain unhelpful? Or is there something to the bystander effect. To find out let's see how helpful people are when they're all by themselves Hi The results with our group of 10 people: it took our participants an average of 8 minutes and 1 second before they lent a hand Can I help? I just feel bad Participants in our groups of 5 were a little quicker saving me from the tent with an average time of 7 minutes and 25 seconds Uh. Do you need help? Do you want to give me a hand? Yeah. That'd be great thank you. What can I do? But when our participants were by themselves that is when they really shined Thank you so much. On average They offered to step in in just 3 minutes and 19 seconds. You were the fastest by a country mile I have set this thing up by myself 7 times today completely you took a total of 12 seconds why why do you think you're so quick to do it? I like to help in any way that I can. that's the funny thing about the bystander effect You would think that a group with more people would mean there's a higher chance someone would do something But people in a group are actually less likely to help I knew I should have just stood up and done it But then a big part of you wanted to see what these people would do and I was just kind of like our than any Of them gonna help. At first I was a little shy to jump it in help, but then after I just you know I'm just gonna jump in and help. Thank you I appreciate it. You're welcome All right, took 8 minutes. When it's just the two of us in this space. There's like a bond that's created It's like I'm not gonna let you struggle on your own, and I think if there is a group of people It's way more acceptable for me to be doing that. it's the diffusion of responsibility I think that's totally true. if something is saying jump in and offer the help Just follow that intuition even though no one else is saying anything just hey if you can be a part of helping someone Instead of just watching the struggle or even take out your cell phone. You're like tape it or something like that which is the worst? Just offer some help So now that you know about the bystander effect ask yourself How often do you feel like you should help someone, but don't because you think somebody else will do it Maybe next time you will be that somebody"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How fast you respond to a stranger in need depends on ", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": " who you are as a person"}, {"label": "B", "text": " what they need help with"}, {"label": "C", "text": " how many people you are with at the time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both a and c"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The more people there are in a group, the less likely you are to offer help.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

For others, just a way to let loose. But despite its casual association\nwith fun and sun, surfing has a richer and deeper\nhistory than many realize. What we today call surfing originated in the Polynesian islands \nof the Pacific Ocean. We know from various accounts that wave riding was done \nthroughout the Polynesian Pacific, as well as in West Africa and Peru. But it was in the Hawaiian archipelago\nin particular that surfing advanced the most, was best documented, and, unlike elsewhere in Polynesia,\npersisted. And for the people of Hawaii, wave sliding was not \njust a recreational activity, but one with spiritual \nand social significance. Like much of Hawaiian society, nearly every aspect of surfing was\ngoverned by a code of rules and taboos known as kapu. Hawaiians made offerings when selecting\na tree to carve, prayed for waves with the help\nof a kahuna, or an expert priest, and gave thanks after surviving\na perilous wipeout. Certain surf breaks were strickly reserved\nfor the elite. But it wasn't just a solemn affair. Surfers competed and wagered\non who could ride the farthest, the fastest, or catch the biggest wave\nwith superior skill, granting respect, social status, and romantic success. Though it was later called\nthe sport of kings, Hawaiian men and women of all ages\nand social classes participated, riding surfboards shaped from koa, breadfruit, or wiliwili trees. Many Hawaiians road alaia boards, which were thin, midsized,\nand somewhat resemble today's shortboards. Some mounted paipo boards, short, round-nosed boards on which\nriders typically lay on their stomachs. But only chieftains could ride\nthe massive olo boards, twice as long as today's longboards. Unlike most modern surfboards, all boards were finless, requiring surfers to drag their hands\nor feet to turn. We don't know exactly when wave sliding\nwas invented, but we know that it had already\nbeen practiced in Polynesia for centuries by the time it was described in 1777\nby William Anderson, a surgeon on Captain Cook's ship\n\"Resolution.\" Although Anderson was in awe, most of the American Christian \nmissionaries who arrived in Hawaii several decades later regarded surfing as sinful, and they discouraged it, along with\nother aspects of native culture. The biggest threat to surfing, however,\nwas the threat to the natives themselves. By 1890, new illnesses introduced\nby Europeans and Americans had decimated the Hawaiian people,\nleaving fewer than 40,000 from a pre-contact population \nthat may have exceeded 800,000. At the same time, foreign influence grew with white settlers overthrowing \nthe native monarchy in 1893, and the U.S. annexing \nthe islands five years later. The end of Hawaii's independence coincided\nwith surfing's native-led revival, a revival soon exploited\nby the American colonizers. But first, some Hawaiians \ntook surfing overseas. In 1907, George Freeth,\nthe so-called Hawaiian Wonder, traveled to the west coast and gave surfing demonstrations \nin southern California. Then in 1914, Olympic swimmer\nDuke Kahanamoku made his way to Australia and New Zealand, gliding across the southern Pacific waves and attracting rapt audiences \nwherever he went. Shortly before Freeth went to California, a South Carolinian named \nAlexander Hume Ford moved to Hawaii. After learning to surf, he became \na champion of the pastime. But Ford may have had unsavory reasons for his enthusiastic efforts \nto boost the sport. Like many settlers, he wanted Hawaii\nto become a U.S. state but was worried about its non-white\nmajority of natives and Asian workers. Ford thus promoted surfing\nto attract white Americans to Hawaii, first as tourists, then as residents. He was helped by numerous writers\nand filmmakers. Ford's demographic plan \nwould fail miserably. Hawaii became a state in 1959 and remains the most racially diverse \nstate in the country. But the promotion of surfing\nwas a far greater success. Today, surfing is a multi-billion dollar\nglobal industry, with tens of millions \nof enthusiasts worldwide. And though relatively few of these surfers\nare aware of the once-crucial wave chants or board carving rituals, Hawaiians continue to preserve\nthese traditions nearly washed away by history's waves."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where was wave-riding for pleasure not done prior to the modern era?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Central America"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Peru"}, {"label": "C", "text": "West Africa"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Polynesia"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following was a type of board used by Hawaiians for riding waves?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Kapu"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mahalo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alaia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aloha"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "By 1890, illnesses introduced by foreigners had killed so many Hawaiians that, out of a pre-contact population that may have exceeded 800,000, approximately _____________ Hawaiians remained.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "400,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "140,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4,000"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Duke Kahanamoku helped to spread surf culture after making his way to _____________ in 1914.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Europe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "South Africa"}, {"label": "C", "text": "South America"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Australia and New Zealand"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to the film, which statement best explains Alexander Hume Ford’s view of surfing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ford believed Hawaiian surf breaks had become too crowded and sought to dissuade people from taking up the pastime"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Surfing, Ford said, was a waste of time and interfered with more useful pursuits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ford hoped that surfing might attract more white settlers to Hawai‘i"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ford argued that surfing was dangerous and was suitable only for native Hawaiians"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Most Titans were destroyed or\ndriven to the eternal hell of Tartarus. But the Titan Prometheus,\nwhose name means foresight, persuaded his brother Epimetheus\nto fight with him on the side of the gods. As thanks, Zeus entrusted the brothers with the task of creating \nall living things. Epimetheus was to distribute the gifts\nof the gods among the creatures. To some, he gave flight; to others, the ability \nto move through water or race through grass. He gave the beasts glittering scales, soft fur, and sharp claws. Meanwhile, Prometheus shaped\nthe first humans out of mud. He formed them in the image of the gods, but Zeus decreed \nthey were too remain mortal and worship the inhabitants \nof Mount Olympus from below. Zeus deemed humans subservient\ncreatures vulnerable to the elements and dependent on the gods for protection. However, Prometheus envisioned his crude\ncreations with a greater purpose. So when Zeus asked him to decide\nhow sacrifices would be made, the wily Prometheus planned a trick\nthat would give humans some advantage. He killed a bull and divided it\ninto two parts to present to Zeus. On one side, he concealed \nthe succulent flesh and skin under the unappealing belly of the animal. On the other, he hid the bones\nunder a thick layer of fat. When Zeus chose the seemingly\nbest portion for himself, he was outraged \nat Prometheus's deception. Fuming, Zeus forbade the use\nof fire on Earth, whether to cook meat \nor for any other purpose. But Prometheus refused to see\nhis creations denied this resource. And so, he scaled Mount Olympus\nto steal fire from the workshop \nof Hephaestus and Athena. He hid the flames in a hollow fennel stalk\nand brought it safely down to the people. This gave them the power to harness\nnature for their own benefit and ultimately dominate the natural order. With fire, humans could care \nfor themselves with food and warmth. But they could also forge weapons\nand wage war. Prometheus's flames acted as a catalyst\nfor the rapid progression of civilization. When Zeus looked down at this scene,\nhe realized what had happened. Prometheus had once again\nwounded his pride and subverted his authority. Furious, Zeus imposed a brutal punishment. Prometheus was to be chained\nto a cliff for eternity. Each day, he would be visited by a vulture\nwho would tear out his liver and each night his liver would grow back\nto be attacked again in the morning. Although Prometheus remained \nin perpetual agony, he never expressed regret \nat his act of rebellion. His resilience in the face of oppression\nmade him a beloved figure in mythology. He was also celebrated for his mischievous\nand inquisitive spirit, and for the knowledge, progress,\nand power he brought to human hands. He's also a recurring figure\nin art and literature. In Percy Bysshe Shelley's\nlyrical drama \"Prometheus Unbound,\" the author imagines Prometheus\nas a romantic hero who escapes and continues to spread\nempathy and knowledge. Of his protagonist, Shelley wrote, \"Prometheus is the type \nof the highest perfection of moral and intellectual nature, impelled by the purest \nand the truest motives to the best and noblest ends.\" His wife Mary envisaged Prometheus\nas a more cautionary figure and subtitled her novel\n\"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus.\" This suggests the damage of corrupting\nthe natural order and remains relevant \nto the ethical questions surrounding science and technology today.

{"page": 89, "lesson": 23, "title": "Why should you read \"Macbeth\"? - Brendan Pelsue", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-macbeth-brendan-pelsue", "transcript": {"en": "There's a play so powerful \nthat an old superstition says its name should never \neven be uttered in a theater, a play that begins with witchcraft\nand ends with a bloody severed head, a play filled with riddles, prophesies,\nnightmare visions, and lots of brutal murder, a play by William Shakespeare sometimes\nreferred to as the \"Scottish Play\" or the \"Tragedy of Macbeth.\" First performed at the Globe Theater\nin London in 1606, \"Macbeth\" is \nShakespeare's shortest tragedy. It is also one of his most action-packed. In five acts, he recounts a story\nof a Scottish nobleman who steals the throne, presides over a reign of terror, and then meets a bloody end. Along the way, it asks important questions\nabout ambition, power, and violence that spoke directly to the politics\nof Shakespeare's time and continue to echo in our own. England in the early 17th century \nwas politically precarious. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603\nwithout producing an heir, and in a surprise move, her advisors passed the crown\nto James Stewart, King of Scotland. Two years later, James was subject\nto an assassination attempt called the Gunpowder Plot. Questions of what made \nfor a legitimate king were on everyone's lips. So Shakespeare must have known\nhe had potent material when he conflated and adapted the stories of a murderous 11th century \nScottish King named Macbeth and those of several \nother Scottish nobles. He found their annals\nin Hollinshed's \"Chronicles,\" a popular 16th century history\nof Britain and Ireland. Shakespeare would also have known\nhe needed to tell his story in a way that would \nimmediately grab the attention of his diverse and rowdy audience. The Globe welcomed \nall sections of society. Wealthier patrons watched the stage\nfrom covered balconies while poorer people paid a penny\nto take in the show from an open-air section called the pit. Talking, jeering, and cheering\nwas common during performances. There are even accounts of audiences\nthrowing furniture when plays were flops. So \"Macbeth\" opens with a literal bang. Thunder cracks and three witches appear. They announce they're searching for a Scottish nobleman \nand war hero named Macbeth, then fly off while chanting a curse\nthat predicts a world gone mad. \"Fair is foul and foul is fair.\nHover through the fog and filthy air.\" As seen later, they find Macbeth\nand his fellow nobleman Banquo. \"All hail Macbeth,\" they prophesize,\n\"that shalt be king hereafter!\" \"King?\" Macbeth wonders. Just what would he have to do \nto gain the crown? Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth soon chart a course of murder, \nlies, and betrayal. In the ensuing bloodbath, Shakespeare provides viewers with some\nof the most memorable passages in English literature. \"Out, damned spot! Out, I say!\"\nLady Macbeth cries when she believes she can't wipe her victim's blood \noff her hands. Her obsession with guilt is one\nof many themes that runs through the play, along with the universal tendency\nto abuse power, the endless cycles of violence \nand betrayal, the defying political conflict. As is typical with Shakespeare's language, a number of phrases \nthat got their start in the play have been repeated so many times\nthat they now feel commonplace. They include \"the milk of human kindness,\" \"what's done is done,\" and the famous witches' spell, \"Double, double toil and trouble; \nFire burn, and caldron bubble.\" But Shakespeare saves the juiciest\nbit of all for Macbeth himself. Towards the end of the play,\nMacbeth reflects on the universality of death and the futility of life. \"Out, out, brief candle!\" he laments. \"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts \nand frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, \nfull of sound and fury signifying nothing.\" Life may be a tale told my an idiot,\nbut \"Macbeth\" is not. Shakespeare's language and characters\nhave entered our cultural consciousness to a rare extent. Directors often use the story\nto shed light on abuses of power, ranging from the American mafia to dictators across the globe. The play has been adapted \nto film many times, including Akira Kurosawa's \n\"Throne of Blood,\" which takes place in feudal Japan, and a modernized version \ncalled \"Scotland, PA,\" in which Macbeth and his rivals are managers of competing \nfast food restaurants. No matter the presentation, questions of morality, politics, and power are still relevant today, and so, it seems, \nis Shakespeare's \"Macbeth.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The audience at the Globe Theatre, where Shakespeare’s plays were performed:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Came from all levels of society"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Were limited to aristocrats and royalty"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Watched the plays in rapt silence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bought their tickets online"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Hated \"Macbeth\""}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "\"Macbeth\" becomes ambitious after hearing a prophecy from:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A magic bean"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An old fortune teller"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Three witches"}, {"label": "D", "text": "His fellow nobleman, Banquo"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A talkative uncle"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Lady Macbeth sees a bloodstain on her hands because she:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is obsessively clean"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Is wracked with guilt"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Is literally covered with blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Has much better eyesight than the average person"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Loves to revel in the violence of her crimes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Shakespeare’s audiences would have been worried about kings being overthrown because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elizabeth I was overthrown by her advisers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Louis XVI had been guillotined only one year earlier"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There had recently been an assassination attempt on James I"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Prince of Wales had a tendency to “over throw” his cricket balls into a neighbor’s yard and the neighbor would not give them back"}, {"label": "E", "text": "James I’s son was not considered fit to rule"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Shakespeare took borrowed the story of \"Macbeth\" from:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An old folktale"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Recent political events"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The library"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A talkative uncle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A sixteenth century historical chronicle"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

But he was getting tired of writing\nthe words \"is equal to\" over and over. His solution? He replaced those words with\ntwo parallel horizontal line segments because the way he saw it,\nno two things can be more equal. Could he have used four line segments\ninstead of two? Of course. Could he have used vertical line segments? In fact, some people did. There's no reason why the equals sign\nhad to look the way it does today. At some point, it just caught on,\nsort of like a meme. More and more mathematicians\nbegan to use it, and eventually, \nit became a standard symbol for equality. Math is full of symbols. Lines, dots, arrows, English letters, Greek letters, superscripts, subscripts. It can look like an illegible jumble. It's normal to find this wealth\nof symbols a little intimidating and to wonder where they all came from. Sometimes, as Recorde himself\nnoted about his equals sign, there's an apt conformity\nbetween the symbol and what it represents. Another example of that \nis the plus sign for addition, which originated from a condensing\nof the Latin word et meaning and. Sometimes, however, the choice of symbol\nis more arbitrary, such as when a mathematician\nnamed Christian Kramp introduced the exclamation mark\nfor factorials just because he needed a shorthand\nfor expressions like this. In fact, all of these symbols \nwere invented or adopted by mathematicians who wanted\nto avoid repeating themselves or having to use a lot of words\nto write out mathematical ideas. Many of the symbols used\nin mathematics are letters, usually from the Latin alphabet\nor Greek. Characters are often found\nrepresenting quantities that are unknown, and the relationships between variables. They also stand in for specific numbers\nthat show up frequently but would be cumbersome or impossible\nto fully write out in decimal form. Sets of numbers and whole equations\ncan be represented with letters, too. Other symbols are used \nto represent operations. Some of these are especially valuable\nas shorthand because they condense repeated operations\ninto a single expression. The repeated addition of the same number\nis abbreviated with a multiplication sign so it doesn't take up more space\nthan it has to. A number multiplied by itself\nis indicated with an exponent that tells you how many times\nto repeat the operation. And a long string of sequential terms\nadded together is collapsed into a capital sigma. These symbols shorten\nlengthy calculations to smaller terms that are much easier to manipulate. Symbols can also provide \nsuccinct instructions about how to perform calculations. Consider the following set\nof operations on a number. Take some number that you're thinking of, multiply it by two, subtract one from the result, multiply the result of that by itself, divide the result of that by three, and then add one to get the final output. Without our symbols and conventions,\nwe'd be faced with this block of text. With them, we have a compact,\nelegant expression. Sometimes, as with equals, these symbols communicate meaning\nthrough form. Many, however, are arbitrary. Understanding them is a matter\nof memorizing what they mean and applying them in different contexts\nuntil they stick, as with any language. If we were to encounter\nan alien civilization, they'd probably have a totally\ndifferent set of symbols. But if they think anything like us,\nthey'd probably have symbols. And their symbols may even correspond\ndirectly to ours. They'd have their own multiplication sign, symbol for pi, and, of course, equals."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The mathematician who first introduced our modern ‘equals’ sign was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gottfried Leibniz"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Albert Einstein"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Christian Kramp"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Robert Recorde"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The symbol used to represent a factorial is the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Period"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exclamation mark"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Parenthesis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Quotation mark"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Letters from the Greek or Latin alphabet can represent:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unknown quantities"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Variables"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Specific numbers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A capital Sigma represents:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A series of multiplications"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A series of additions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A series of divisions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A series of exponents"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The meaning of mathematical symbols is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Suggested by the symbol itself"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arbitrary"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both a and b"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neither a nor b"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
