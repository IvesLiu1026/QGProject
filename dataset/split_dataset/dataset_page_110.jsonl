Hacking into the nuclear missile launch\noverride— a little harder. But now you’ve got a problem: \nyou don’t have the override code. You know you need \nthe same two numbers that the agents of chaos just used\nto authorize the launch. But one wrong answer will lock you out. From your hiding spot, \nyou’ve been able to learn the following: The big boss didn’t trust any minion \nwith the full information to launch nuclear missiles on their own. So he gave one launch code to Minion A, \nthe other to minion B, and forbade them to share \nthe numbers with each other. When the order came, each entered their own number \nand activated the countdown. That was 50 minutes ago, and there's only 10 minutes left\nbefore the missiles launch. Suddenly, the boss says, “Funny story— \nyour launch codes were actually related. I chose a set of distinct positive\nintegers with at least two elements, each less than 7, and told their sum\nto you, A, and their product to you, B.” After a moment of awkward silence,\nA says to B, “I don’t know whether you know my number.” B thinks this over, then responds, “I know your number, and now I know\nyou know my number too.” That’s all you’ve got. What numbers do you enter \nto override the launch? Pause now to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Ignorance-based puzzles like this are\nnotoriously difficult to work through. The trick is to put yourself \nin the heads of both characters and narrow down the possibilities \nbased on what they know or don’t know. So let's start with A's first statement. It means that B could conceivably\nhave something with the potential to reveal A’s number,\nbut isn’t guaranteed to. That doesn’t sound very definitive, \nbut it can lead us to a major insight. The only scenarios where B could know\nA’s number are when there’s exactly one valid way \nto factor B’s number. Try factoring a few \nand you’ll find the pattern— It could be prime— where the product\nmust be of 1 and itself— or it could be the product of 1 \nand the square of a prime, such as 4. In both cases, there is exactly one sum. For a number like 8, factoring it \ninto 2 and 4, or 1, 2, and 4, creates too many options. Because the boss’s numbers \nmust be less than 7, A’s list of B’s possibilities\nonly has these 4 numbers. Here’s where we can conclude a major clue. To think B could have these numbers,\nA’s number must be a sum of their factors— so 3, 4, 5, or 6. We can eliminate 3 and 4,\nbecause if the sum was either, the product could only be 2 or 3, in which case A would know that B \nalready knows A’s number, contradicting A’s statement. 5 and 6, however, are in play, because they can become \nsums in multiple ways. The need to consider this is one of \nthe most difficult parts of this puzzle. The crucial thing to remember \nis that there’s no guarantee that B’s number is on A’s list— those are just the possibilities \nfrom A’s perspective that would allow B to deduce A’s number. That ambiguity forces us to go through\nunintuitive multi-step processes like: consider a product, see what sums\ncan result from its factors, then break those apart \nand see what products can result. We’ll soon have to do something similar \ngoing from sums to products and back to sums. But now we know— \nwhen A made his first statement, he must have been holding\neither 5 or 6. B has access to the same information \nwe do, so he knows this too. Let’s review what’s in each\nbrain at this point: everyone knows a lot about the sum,\nbut only B knows the product. Now let’s look at the first part \nof B’s statement. What if A’s number was 5? That could be from 1+4 or 2+3, in which case B would have\neither 4 or 6. 4 would tell B what A had, like he said, because there’s only one option to make\nthe product: 4 times 1. 6, on the other hand, could be broken \ndown three ways, which sum like so. 7 isn’t on B’s list of possible sums,\nbut 5 and 6 both are. Meaning that B wouldn’t know\nwhether A’s number was 5 or 6, and we can eliminate this option \nbecause it contradicts his statement. So this is great— 5 and 4\ncould be the override code, but how do we know it's the only one? Let’s consider if A’s number was 6— which would be 1+5, 2+4, or 1+2+3, giving B 5, 8, or 6, respectively. If B had 5, he’d know that A had 6. And if he had 8, the possibilities for A \nwould be 2+4 and 1+2+4. Only 6 is on the list of possible sums,\nso B would again know that A had 6. To summarize, if A had 6, he still wouldn’t know whether\nB had 5 or 8. That contradicts the second half \nof what B said, and 5 and 4 must be the correct codes. With seconds to spare you override \nthe missile launch, shoot yourself out of the torpedo bay, and send the sub \nto the bottom of the ocean."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What type of number was provided to Minion A?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The product of the positive integers."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The sum of the positive integers."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both the sum and the product of the positive integers."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neither the sum nor the product of the positive integers."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What clue does Minion B provide?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He knows Minion A’s number, but not his own number."}, {"label": "B", "text": "He doesn’t know whether Minion A knows either number."}, {"label": "C", "text": "He knows his own number, but not Minion A’s number."}, {"label": "D", "text": "He knows Minion A’s number and now (after A’s statement) knows that Minion A can deduce his own number."}], "correct_option": null}, {"question": "How could Minion B know Minion A’s number?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only if there is exactly one valid way to factor Minion B’s number."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Only if there are multiple ways to factor Minion B’s number."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only if Minion B is a double agent and discovered the code on a covert mission"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only if Minion B is lying.

When her three adult sons\nunderwent genetic testing to determine whether they were a match\nfor kidney donation, the test showed that two of them\nweren’t actually her sons. Keegan knew she was her sons’ mother— she had conceived and given birth to them. Figuring there must have been an error, \nher doctors pursued further testing, only to uncover something \neven more confusing: she was her children’s biological aunt. It turned out that Keegan had a second \ngenome in some tissues and organs. In other words, some of her cells had \na completely different set of genes from the others. This second set of genes belonged \nto her twin sister— who had never been born. This condition, \nwhere an individual has two genomes present in the tissues of their body, is called chimerism. The name comes from Greek mythology, where chimera is an amalgam\nof three different animals. Individuals with chimerism might have \ntwo-toned skin or hair, or two different colored eyes, but most are believed to have no visible\nsigns of the condition. Chimerism can come from a twin in utero,\nfrom a tissue or organ transplant, or happen between a fetus \nand a pregnant woman. So how exactly does it happen? In one of the most common forms, a mother and fetus swap cells \nin the flow of nutrients across the placenta. The mother can inherit fetal stem cells, undifferentiated cells that are able \nto develop into any specialized cell. The fetal cells initially go undetected because the mother’s immune system \nis suppressed during pregnancy. But in some cases, cells \nwith the fetus’s DNA persist in the mother’s body \nfor years or even decades without being destroyed\nby her immune system. In one case, a mother's liver was failing, but suddenly started to regenerate itself. Her doctors biopsied her liver,\nand found DNA in the regenerated tissue from a pregnancy almost 20 years earlier. The fetal stem cells had lodged in her\nliver and specialized as liver cells. Karen Keegan, meanwhile, acquired \nher second genome before she was born. Very early in her own mother’s pregnancy\nwith her, Keegan had a fraternal twin. Keegan’s embryo absorbed some \nfetal stem cells from her twin’s embryo, which did not develop to term. By the time Keegan’s fetus \ndeveloped an immune system, it had many cells with each genome, and the immune system recognized\nboth genomes as her body’s own— so it didn’t attack or destroy the cells\nwith the second genome. We don’t know how much of her body was\ncomposed of cells with this second genome— that can vary from one organ to another,\nand even between tissues within an organ: some might have no cells at all\nwith the second genome, while others might have many. At least some of the egg-producing tissue\nin her ovaries must have carried the second genome. Each time she conceived there would be \nno way to predict which genome would be involved— which is how two of her children\nended up with the genes of a woman who had never been born. This can also happen to fathers. In 2014, when ancestry testing \ndetermined that a father was actually his baby’s biological uncle, researchers discovered that 10%\nof the father’s sperm carried a second genome \nfrom an embryonic twin. Cases like this challenge \nour perception of genetics. Though there are very few documented cases\nof chimerism from an embryonic twin, we’re all amalgams to some extent, carrying around the different genetic\ncodes of our gut bacteria and even our mitochondria. And given that 1 in 8 individual births\nstarted out as twin pregnancies, there could be many more people\nwith two genomes— and many more lessons to learn\nabout the genes that make us who we are."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In what way was Karen Keegan related to two of her sons?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Step-mother"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Grandmother"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Biological Aunt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Adoptive mother"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How did Karen Keegan receive her second set of DNA?

Researchers were looking for the spectral \nsignature of carbon dioxide when they noticed something baffling: an unexpected wavelength\nof unknown origin. They tried looking at Earth \nwith only this wavelength, and saw the planet covered \nin a red hue of varying intensity. This couldn’t have been reflected sunlight because it was a wavelength that never \nescapes the Sun’s outer atmosphere. And it didn’t correspond \nwith densely populated areas, suggesting it wasn’t human-made either. In fact, it was emanating \nfrom places with lots of plants: the Amazon basin, \nnorthern evergreen forests, and croplands of the Midwestern US \nwere all ablaze. So, what was going on? Plants and other organisms use light\nto grow by way of photosynthesis. But that’s just one of three\nways that light entering a photosynthetic organism \nis used. And this is the key to solving \nthe mystery. To understand the others, \nwe need to begin with photosynthesis. During this process, sunlight hits structures within a plant’s \ncells called chloroplasts, which are packed \nwith chlorophyll pigments. When chlorophyll molecules absorb light, \nsome of their electrons become excited. They go through a series of reactions, which transform light energy \ninto chemical energy. This powers the conversion of carbon \ndioxide and water into glucose, the simple sugar plants need to grow. And of course, this reaction generates\nan important byproduct. Photosynthesis— which is constantly being carried \nout by plants, algae, and bacteria— produces all of Earth’s oxygen. But plants regularly absorb more light\nthan they’re able to consume. For instance, over winter, the frozen leaves of evergreen trees can't\nphotosynthesize at their usual rate, but they're still exposed\nto a lot of sunlight. If not dealt with, the excess light can\ndamage their photosynthetic machinery. So, the second way plants use light\nis by transforming it into heat and dissipating it out of their leaves. The third way plants interact \nwith incoming light is by radiating it back out \nat a different wavelength, producing what’s called \nchlorophyll fluorescence. During photosynthesis, \nthe chlorophyll’s excited electrons move through that series\nof chemical reactions. But as some of the excited electrons\nfall back to their ground states, they emit energy as light. Overall, about 1% of the light \nabsorbed is re-emitted as wavelengths at the red\nend of the spectrum. It’s such a small amount that you\ncan’t see it with the naked eye. But plants the world over are fluorescing\nas they photosynthesize. And this is what’s caused \nthe Earth’s baffling red glow, as observed by satellite. It was an accidental discovery, \nbut a huge breakthrough. Tracking chlorophyll fluorescence \nfrom space allows us to watch the planet breathe\nin real time— and monitor the health \nof ecosystems worldwide. Previously, researchers used levels\nof greenness as the main estimate for plant health. Because plants generally change colors \nor lose foliage when they’re stressed, higher levels of green typically\nindicate healthier plants. But this measure can be unreliable. In contrast, chlorophyll fluorescence \nis a direct measure of photosynthetic activity. It can help us infer how much\noxygen is being released and how much carbon is being absorbed \nin a given system. Drops in chlorophyll fluorescence \nmay also occur before visible signs of plant stress,\nmaking it a timely measure. Scientists have already used chlorophyll\nfluorescence to monitor harmful phytoplankton blooms, and track the effects of drought \nin the Amazon and Great Plains. Going forward, we’ll be investigating \nphotosynthesis from space, and gauging how best to support \nour silent friends, who already do so much for us."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are some areas that scientists found to be particularly bright with fluorescence?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Amazon basin, New York City and the Midwestern US"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Amazon basin, Northern Evergreen Forests and the Midwestern US"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antarctica, Tokyo and Northern Evergreen Forests"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Antarctica, The Sahara Desert and the Amazon basin"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What molecule absorbs light to drive photosynthesis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Zeaxanthin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Glucose"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Violaxanthin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chlorophyll"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is/are consumed during photosynthesis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glucose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chlorophyll"}, {"label": "C", "text": " Carbon dioxide"}, {"label": "D", "text": " Oxygen"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following are products of photosynthesis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chlorophyll and Carbon dioxide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Oxygen and Carbon dioxide"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Glucose and Oxygen             "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Glucose and Carbon dioxide"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "About what percent of light absorbed by a plant is reemitted as fluorescence?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "~1%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "~25%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "~50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "~99%"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
