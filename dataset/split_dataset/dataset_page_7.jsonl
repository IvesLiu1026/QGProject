Native to the Americas and known \nfor their spines and succulent stems, cacti of all shapes and sizes have evolved\nto not just survive, but thrive, in some of the harshest desert climates \non Earth. So how do they do it? A cactus’s spines are one\nkey to its survival— but not for the reason you might think. Take a look at the prickly pear. Its spines are highly modified leaves. A normal leaf’s large surface area would\nbe ill-suited to the desert, transpiring massive amounts \nof water under the baking sun. The dramatically reduced surface area\nof the spines limits water loss. They also shade the cactus \nand reflect the sun’s rays, reducing the plant's core temperature\nduring the heat of the day. Then, at night, \nwhen air temperatures plummet, the spines act as an insulating layer, keeping the cactus from cooling \ndown too much. These functions are just as important,\nif not more, than defending against predators. From Cuba to Mexico, and as far south \nas Brazil and Peru, Melon cacti grow on limestone soils \nin seasonally dry tropical forests, where they're constantly exposed\nto the beating sun. They rely on another adaptation\ncommon to cacti: a thick skin, which is coated in a waxy substance\ncalled a cuticle that limits water loss. Meanwhile, the stomata— tiny holes that allow the exchange\nof gases that enable photosynthesis— remain firmly closed \nuntil night when they open. The lower temperatures at night \nmean the cactus loses less water from the stem when the stomata open. The bulk of the plant acts \nas a large barrel of water, storing it for times of need. But to survive the desert, \na cactus can’t just limit water loss— it has to be prepared \nto take full advantage of the rare situations where water\nis readily available. In North America’s Sonoran Desert, the towering Saguaro cactus can grow\nup to 20 meters tall and live for up to 200 years. Woody tissue, like the kind found \nin tree trunks, give the Saguaro its height, but the Saguaro survives \nwith way less water than most trees. Most of its roots are only \na few inches deep. Just below the soil’s surface, \nthey spread out laterally for meters and hold the plant in place. Even its single deepest root,\nthe taproot, extends less than one meter \ninto the ground. After a rain, the lateral roots\nrespond in real time, rapidly growing and spreading. They produce ephemeral rain roots \nthat quickly take up the available water. The water is then pulled\nup into the plant body and stored in cells that contain mucilage, a gluey substance that clings \nto water molecules and stops them from evaporating \nif the plant’s tissue is ever damaged and exposed. As the soil dries after the rain, the small rain roots also start to dry \nand wither away, and the cactus awaits the next time\nit can take advantage of a shower. Taken together, these features make cacti\nwell-equipped to survive their environments, from the driest desert\nto... a tropical rainforest? The mistletoe cactus can live on the\nbranches of trees in the rainforest. Though there’s lots of water around,\nnot much of it reaches the cactus here, and there's nowhere for its roots to go. So even here, the cactus survives \nusing adaptations that long ago helped its ancestors \nsurvive the desert."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What part of the world are cacti native to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Americas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Africa"}, {"label": "C", "text": "India"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Europe"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Australia"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What plant structure are the spines on a cactus a modification of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "roots"}, {"label": "B", "text": "hairs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "leaves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "flowers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the gooey substance inside a cactus that helps it retain water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Starch"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mucilage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Epidermis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Salt"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the thick, waxy substance on the skin of the cactus called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "cuticle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "spines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "leaves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "epidermis"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What type of roots do cacti produce in response to precipitation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Spine roots"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rain roots"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tap roots"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aerial roots"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

You could buy a steam-powered car. Typically relying on gas-powered boilers, \nthese could drive as far as you wanted— provided you also wanted to lug\naround extra water to refuel and didn’t mind waiting 30 minutes\nfor your engine to heat up. Alternatively, you could buy\na car powered by gasoline. However, the internal combustion engines\nin these models required dangerous hand-cranking to start and emitted loud noises\nand foul-smelling exhaust while driving. So your best bet was probably\noption number three: a battery-powered electric vehicle. These cars were quick to start,\nclean and quiet to run, and if you lived somewhere with access \nto electricity, easy to refuel overnight. If this seems like an easy choice,\nyou're not alone. By the end of the 19th century, \nnearly 40% of American cars were electric. In cities with early electric systems, battery-powered cars were \na popular and reliable alternative to their occasionally explosive \ncompetitors. But electric vehicles had one\nmajor problem— batteries. Early car batteries were expensive\nand inefficient. Many inventors, including Thomas Edison, tried to build batteries \nthat stored more electricity. Others even built exchange stations \nin urban areas to swap out dead batteries for charged ones. But these measures weren’t enough to allow\nelectric vehicles to make long trips. And at over twice the price \nof a gas-powered car, many couldn’t afford these luxury items. At the same time, oil discoveries\nlowered the price of gasoline, and new advances made internal combustion\nengines more appealing. Electric starters removed the need\nfor hand-cranking, mufflers made engines quieter and \nrubber engine mounts reduced vibration. In 1908, Ford released the Model T; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car \nthat captured the public imagination. By 1915, the percentage of electric cars\non the road had plummeted. For the next 55 years, internal combustion\nengines ruled the roads. Aside from some special-purpose vehicles,\nelectric cars were nowhere to be found. However, in the 1970s, \nthe tide began to turn. US concerns about oil availability renewed\ninterest in alternative energy sources. And studies in the 1980s linking \ncar emissions with smog in cities like Los Angeles encouraged governments \nand environmental organizations to reconsider electric vehicles. At this point, car companies had spent\ndecades investing in internal combustion engines \nwithout devoting any resources to solving the century-old \nbattery problem. But other companies were developing\nincreasingly efficient batteries to power a new wave \nof portable electronics. By the 1990s, energy dense nickel metal\nhydride batteries were on the market, soon followed by lithium-ion batteries. Alongside regulatory mandates \nby California to reduce smog, these innovations sparked a small wave\nof new electric vehicles, including hybrid cars. Hybrids aren’t true electric vehicles; their nickel metal hydride batteries are only used to optimize \nthe efficiency of gas-burning engines. But in 2008, Tesla Motors went further, grabbing the attention of consumers, \nautomakers, and regulators with its lithium-ion-powered Roadster. This purely electric vehicle could travel \nmore than 320 kilometers on a single charge, almost doubling the previous record. Since then, electric vehicles have \nvastly improved in cost, performance, efficiency, and availability. They can accelerate much faster\nthan gas-powered sports cars, and while some models still\nhave a high upfront cost, they reliably save their drivers money\nin the long run. As governments around the world focus \non slowing climate change, electric vehicles are now expected \nto replace gas-powered ones altogether. In Norway, 75% of car sales in 2020 \nwere plug-in electric vehicles. And policies such as California’s\nZero Emission Vehicle mandate and Europe’s aggressive \nCO2 emission standards have dramatically slowed investments \nin gas-powered vehicles worldwide. Soon, electric cars will reclaim \ntheir place on the road, putting gasoline in our rearview."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was a major flaw of early electric vehicles?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They were noisy and foul-smelling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They were expensive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The engine took 30 minutes to heat up"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They required hand-cranking"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In 1908, Ford released the ___; a cheap, high-quality gas-powered car.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Model T"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Prius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Roadster"}, {"label": "D", "text": "P1"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What led to renewed interest in electric cars in the 1970s and 1980s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Availability of cheaper batteries"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A government ban on gas burning engines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Movies featuring futuristic electric cars"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Concerns about oil shortages and air pollution"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What made it possible for Tesla’s Roadster to travel more than 320 km on a single charge?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A nickel metal hydride battery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An electric starter"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A lithium-ion battery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A hybrid electric and gas-powered engine"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In Norway, ___ percent of car sales in 2020 were plug-in electric vehicles.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "82"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "75"}, {"label": "D", "text": "61"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Located at the mouth of the Bay of Bengal, this coastal village was built \non top of the Meghna River delta. Deltas are a kind of landmass formed \nwhen sediment carried by rivers is deposited where that river meets \na larger body of water. River deltas are incredibly fertile\necosystems capable of supporting abundant agriculture\nand marine life. However, their borders gradually change\nas rivers bring more sediment in and storms wash sediment away. The residents of Mohammadpur are well\naccustomed to managing the ebbs and flows of this ever-shifting\nlandscape. But lately, an abundance of intense\ncyclones have caused frequent flooding that impedes farming and fishing. These floods also erode the coastline, allowing later storms to wipe\naway land altogether. Since 2000, the Meghna River has overtaken\nthe coastline by 2.5 kilometers, forcing many villagers to move inland\nor to nearby cities. Mohammadpur isn’t the only place \nwhere erratic weather is impacting people’s mobility. Repeated typhoons in the Philippines have \ndisplaced thousands from their homes. In Fiji, the government is already moving\nmany coastal villages inland to get ahead of predicted land loss. And in the United States, melting permafrost is causing chunks\nof the Alaskan coastline to erode. In some ways, this is nothing new. Humanity has always adapted\nto changing weather and moved to regions that best support\ncultural lifestyles and livelihoods. However, scientists agree \nthat this rise in extreme weather is a by-product of Earth’s \nrapidly changing climate. Global warming increases the frequency and\nintensity of storms, flooding and drought, while also melting polar ice caps \nand raising sea levels. These factors are changing the environment\nmuch faster than they have in the past. Even for communities with the resources \nto take action, the variable pace and nature of these\nchanges makes them difficult to adapt to. And the vulnerable populations most\nimpacted by climate change are often those least responsible. Many facing climate mobility live \nin farming and fishing communities in countries that generate dramatically \nfewer emissions than their larger counterparts. Bangladesh is one such country. The nation has a unique combination\nof low-lying geography and heavily populated coastal regions. Most of these vulnerable coastal families,\nlike those in Mohammadpur, don’t want to abandon \ntheir homes and livelihoods. And for others, leaving Bangladesh\nisn’t financially practical. So to stay with their communities, many have moved a few meters inland and built more resilient homes\non higher ground or elevated stilts. Others have tried to buy land on newly\nemerging islands in the delta, while some have sent family members\nto find work in nearby cities. A handful of individuals might even cross\ninternational borders, if they have family, friends, or work \nconnections on the other side. But many of the residents who’ve left\nare eager to return home. Unfortunately, it's unclear when\nweather extremes will die down, and the government has repeatedly delayed\nprojects to build concrete embankments that would prevent further erosion. In other parts of the world, people couldn’t move inland \neven if they wanted to. The low-lying Pacific Island nations \nof Kiribati and Tuvalu are only 811 square kilometers\nand 26 square kilometers, respectively; so migration would mean moving \nto a different country altogether. Instead, their governments and citizens\nhave united in physically, legally, and politically \nfortifying their countries. Island residents are planting\ncoastal mangrove forests, and building up low-lying areas of land\nwith dredged sand to shield themselves against storms \nand rising sea levels. And the islands’ governments have\nrepeatedly lobbied on the global stage for countries with the highest emissions \nto reduce pollution and take responsibility \nfor climate change. The challenges facing\neach coastal community are unique, and the diversity of the people's\nexperiences can make climate mobility a difficult phenomenon \nto measure and define. But as new communities are endangered\nby extreme weather, it’s more important than ever\nto listen to those on the front lines of this crisis."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Changes in the Bangladesh delta are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Natural to its ecosystem "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exacerbated due to climatic changes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Influenced by infrastructure, such as embankments, dams and barrages  "}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are most of the residents of Mohammadpur doing in response to challenges such as cyclones, floods and coastal erosion:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Moving to a new country"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Moving their houses inland "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Moving to nearby islands or cities"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both B and C"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which country’s government is pro-actively moving coastal villages inland:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fiji"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tuvalu"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Philippines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kiribati"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What actions are being taken by the governments and citizens of island nations Tuvalu and Kiribati on climate change:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Planting mangroves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Building up low-lying areas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lobbying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT true:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Climate change is affecting the ways in which people in coastal areas live and work."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Most people in Mohammadpur want to stay close to their current homes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Most people in Tuvalu want to move to a new country."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Human mobility associated with climate change is difficult to define and measure.

And it seems unthinkable\nwhen you wake up and say you're going to leave a job like that\nto pursue a passion. And that was my dilemma six years ago. I had a comfortable job,\nI lived a comfortable life, and people expected me to be fulfilled, but I wasn't. There was something\nin me that wanted more. There was a misalignment\nbetween the things I did on a daily basis and the things that I deeply cared about. And so I decided to quit and explore the possibility of bringing\nthis passion into my daily routine. And the thing about finding your passion is that it's not straightforward. Even for people with money and degrees, they still struggle\nto identify their passion. And here I was as a 30-year-old, talking about finding my passion and turning it into a career. Literally, people told me, \"You don't talk about passion\nuntil you've made enough money -- (Laughter) or at least until\nyou're ready to retire.\" Because there's a notion\nthat looking inward and finding the things that give us\npleasure and fulfillment is a luxury that only the rich can enjoy, or a pleasure that only\nthe retired can indulge in. Which made me wonder: Is passion only for the rich, or an experience\nonly the retired can enjoy? For many of us, we've been led to believe that life is a race of survival. We've been conditioned\nto see ourselves as survivors that must do everything\nin our power to survive. In Africa, we're nurtured to go\nthrough school, cram and pass, in the hope that you get a job after. And if you do, stick at it\nno matter how much it sucks. (Laughter) Until you get a better offer\nor you're asked to retire. And as a dropout, I knew that I was\nnot entitled to anything. Every opportunity was a privilege. And so when I thought about quitting, it was a huge risk. I was given two alternatives, which are the most popular in Africa. The first one is sign up for any course\nat a vocational institution and do it. My second option,\nsettle for any job offer you can get, no matter the working conditions, and do it. That probably explains why we have\nso many of our young people being trafficked\nin search of greener pastures. I opted for the first option. I did look at a couple\nvocational institutions in the hope that I would find a course\nthat resonated with my persona, my dream and my aspiration. I was disappointed to learn that there\nwas no room for misfits like me in these institutions. The education system\nin many parts of the world has been designed\naround preselected options that young people are expected\nto fit in or risk becoming misfits. And so going through school,\nI was nurtured and conditioned to think in the straight line\nand stay within the straight line. But when I dropped out,\nI discovered a world of possibilities. I knew I could be anything,\nI could study anything, and so I leveraged free online courses. That's how I built my CV,\ngot into employment and worked for eight years. And after eight years, I told myself there must be more to life than just going through\nthe routines of life. So in 2014, I started\nan organization called Kyusa where we are working\nwith out-of-school youth and empowering them to turn their passions into profitable, scalable\nand sustainable businesses. Now, when we talk about passion, one of the most common questions\nthat people ask is, \"What is passion? How do I even find it?\" And in the simplest definition, passion is a collection\nof your life experiences that give you the deepest\nsense of fulfillment. And to identify your passion,\nyou need to look inward. So we use two reflective questions. The first question we ask is, \"If you had all the time\nand the money in the world, what would you spend your time doing?\" It sounds like a very simple question, but many people struggle\nto answer this question because they've just\nnever thought about it. The second question we ask is, \"What makes you happy or gives you the deepest\nsense of fulfillment?\" Now, you would assume that we all\nknow what makes us happy, but it's also interesting to note\nthat so many people have no idea what makes them happy, because they are so busy\ngoing through the routines of life, they've never stopped to look inward. And so identifying the things\nthat give us a deep sense of fulfillment and the things that give us deep joy are thoughts that begin to direct us\nin the direction of our passion. And just in case you're wondering what your answers are\nto those two questions, I invite you to sit with these questions\nlater and just reflect about it. However, I am also aware that passion alone\ncannot guarantee success in life. And I should note that not every passion\ncan become a career. For passion to become a career, it must be coupled with the right set\nof skills, conditioning and positioning. So when we get our young people\nto look inward, we also ask them what skills do you have, what talents do you have,\nwhat experience do you have that you can use to build\na niche in the marketplace. But more than that,\nwe also look at the market trends, because it doesn't matter\nhow much you love and enjoy it. If nobody wants it\nor is willing to pay for it, it can't be a career. It's just a hobby. And the third thing we look at\nis how do you position yourself? Who are you targeting?\nWho do you want to sell to? Why would they want to buy from you? And so the combination of the three\nis what enables you to move from just a passion to a business. And many of our young people\nhave been able to turn their ideas and burning desires\ninto profitable businesses or social enterprises, and they're not just creating jobs, but they are solving societal challenges. I'll share with you two examples. One of them is Esther. I met Esther two years ago. She had been out of school for two years, and she had been deeply affected\nby her dropping out. As a result, she had experienced\nsevere depression to a point where she attempted\nto take her own life several times. Her friends and family\ndidn't know what to do for her. They simply prayed for her. When I met Esther\nand I started to converse with her, I asked her a simple question. I said, \"If you had all the time\nand the money in the world, what would you do?\" Without thinking or hesitation, her eyes lit up and she began to tell me how she wanted to change\nthe lives of young people. She wanted to restore\nhope and dignity to other teenagers by helping them make\ninformed decisions about life. I was certain of the fact\nthat this burning desire in her was unquenchable. And so we worked with Esther\nto put a framework around this desire. Today, she runs a social\nenterprise in her village, raising awareness about substance abuse,\nmental health, sexual reproductive health and is helping other school dropouts\nacquire vocational skills, so they can make a living for themselves. Esther turned 20 this year, and for the last two years,\nshe has organized an annual teen fest that brings together over 500 teenagers. (Applause) Young people that are able\nto network and collaborate on different projects, but more importantly to meet professionals\nthey would otherwise never have met. This is all engineered by a girl that\nbelieved the world had no room for her, that without education\nshe would never amount to anything. But by looking inward\nand tapping into a burning desire, putting structure around it, it has become a model\nthat not only changed her life but is transforming the lives\nof hundreds of young people every year. My other example is Musa. Musa is a natural artistic guy. He's the kind that would look\nat any design and replicate it with ease. And so he seeks to recognize\nthat ability in him. When I met Musa,\nhe was doing all kinds of crafts -- bags, belts, wallets -- but it was more of a part-time thing. Or sometimes, if he was really broke\nand needed to make quick money, then he would come up\nwith a design and sell it. But he had never thought\nof it as a business. We started working with Musa, helping him shift his mindset\nfrom a hobby to a business and beginning to rethink how he can\nmake products that he could sell and even be able to scale. Musa makes some of\nthe most amazing bags I've ever seen, and over the last one year,\nMusa's business has grown. He has been recognized\nin different places. Currently, he's talking about\nexporting to developed countries. Musa, like any other dropout, believed that without\nacademic credentials, he wouldn't amount to anything. He thought the talent he had was nothing simply because he did not have\nan academic paper to define him. But by looking inward and finding\nthat what he had was the greatest asset and supporting him\nto turn it into a business, he's not just living -- he's thriving. The thing about looking inward\nis that it can be scary, especially if you're doing it\nfor the first time. But the truth is\nyou never truly start living until you learn to live\nfrom the inside out. And in unlocking potential,\nwe need to look inward to identify the things that give us\na deep sense of fulfillment, the things that give us the deepest joy, and then weave them\ninto the patterns of our daily routines. In so doing, we cease to work\nand we start to live. And the thing about living is that\nyou never have to retire or to resign. (Laughter) (Applause) And so as you think about\nunlocking potential for ourselves, for our young people, for our children, let's not condition them to look outward but condition them to look inward to tap into who they are and bring\nthat self into what they do every day. When you cease to work and you live, when passion becomes a career, you don't just excel, you become unstoppable. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But the vaccines for COVID-19 cleared \nthe threshold for emergency use in less than 11 months. The secret behind this speed \nis a medical technology that’s been developing for decades: the mRNA vaccine. This new treatment uses our body’s \nexisting cellular machinery to trigger an immune response, protecting us from viruses without\never experiencing an infection. And in the future, this approach might\nbe able to treat new diseases almost as quickly as they emerge. So how do these \nrevolutionary vaccines work? The key ingredient is in the name. mRNA, or messenger ribonucleic acid,\nis a naturally occurring molecule that encodes the instructions \nfor producing proteins. When our cells process mRNA, \na part of the cell called the ribosome translates and follows these instructions\nto build the encoded protein. The mRNA in these vaccines works\nin exactly the same way, but scientists use the molecule to safely\nintroduce our body to a virus. First, researchers encode trillions \nof mRNA molecules with the instructions for a specific viral protein. This part of the virus is\nharmless by itself, but helpful for training \nour body’s immune response. Then, they inject those molecules \ninto a nanoparticle roughly 1,000 times smaller \nthan the average cell. This nanoparticle is made of lipids, the same type of fatty material that forms\nthe membrane around our cells. But these lipids have been \nspecially engineered to protect the mRNA on its journey \nthrough the body and assist its entry into the cell. Lastly, the final ingredients are added:\nsugars and salt to help keep the nanoparticles intact \nuntil they reach their destination. Before use, the vaccine is kept at a \ntemperature of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius to ensure none of the components\nbreak down. Once injected, the nanoparticles\ndisperse and encounter cells. The lipid coating on each nanoparticle\nfuses with the lipid membrane of a cell and releases the mRNA to do its work. At this point, we should note \nthat while the vaccine is delivering viral genetic material into our cells, it’s impossible for this material \nto alter our DNA. mRNA is a short-lived molecule that would need additional enzymes and \nchemical signals to even access our DNA, let alone change it. And none of these DNA altering components\nare present in mRNA vaccines. Once inside the cell, the ribosome\ntranslates the mRNA’s instructions and begins assembling the viral protein. In COVID-19 vaccines, that protein \nis one of the spikes typically found on the virus’s surface. Without the rest of the virus \nthis lone spike is not infectious, but it does trigger our immune response. Activating the immune system\ncan be taxing on the body, resulting in brief fatigue, fever, \nand muscle soreness in some people. But this doesn’t mean \nthe recipient is sick— it means the vaccine is working. The body is producing antibodies to fight\nthat viral protein, that will then stick around to defend \nagainst future COVID-19 infections. And since this particular protein is\nlikely to be found in most COVID variants, these antibodies should reduce \nthe threat of catching new strains. This approach offers significant\nadvantages over previous vaccines. Traditional vaccines contain \nweakened versions of live viruses or amputated sections of a virus, both of which required time intensive\nresearch to prepare and unique chemical treatments\nto safely inject. But mRNA vaccines don’t actually\ncontain any viral particles, so they don’t have to be built \nfrom scratch to safely adjust each virus. In fact, every mRNA vaccine could have\nroughly the same list of ingredients. Imagine a reliable, robustly tested\nvaccine that can treat any disease by swapping out a single component.

But while many deemed it uninhabitable, recent findings suggest that \na hidden society persisted in the Swamp until the mid-1800′s. So, who lived there? \nAnd what happened to them? People long suspected that communities\nhad settled in the Swamp, but the historical record was spotty. It wasn’t until 2003 that the first\nsystematic archaeological foray finally launched. But, despite having been\nextensively drained over the years, the wetland still presented\nmany practical challenges. Researchers had to penetrate\nthorny thickets, wade through waters studded\nwith sinkholes, and braved the threats \nof dangerous animals. After several months, they finally found\nislands in the Swamp’s interior. These formations quickly revealed\ntraces of centuries-old secrets. Archeologists found buried markings \nthat appear to have been left by raised log cabins, fire pits, \nand basins that may have collected drinking water. They identified what seems \nto have been a palisade wall and excavated more than 3,000 artifacts, including weaponry, stone tools, and \nfragments of ceramic pipes and vessels. These discoveries, combined\nwith previous findings, helped tell a story that reaches\nfar back in time. Indigenous American people began regularly\ninhabiting or visiting the area around 11,000 BCE, \nbefore it was even a swampland. A second era of occupation began\nmuch later. In the early 1600′s, more \nIndigenous people came seeking refuge from colonization. And later that century,\nit seems that Maroons— or people escaping from slavery—\nbegan entering the area. In fact, the team’s findings\nsupport the theory that the Great Dismal Swamp was home \nto the largest Maroon settlement in all of North America. Because their success and survival \ndepended on staying hidden from the outside world, these Swamp communities were largely\nself-sufficient. Based on primary sources, historians believe that people cultivated\ngrains and created homes, furniture, musical instruments, and more \nfrom the Swamp’s available resources. These organic materials had probably\nalready decomposed by the time archaeologists\ncame to investigate. But researchers were able to find \nmore durable objects, like ceramic and stone items that were \nlikely left by ancient Indigenous people then reused and modified \nby others later on. Around the turn of the 19th century,\nIt seems the relationship between the Swamp’s community \nand the outside world changed. Lumber and manufacturing companies began\nencroaching on the Swamp’s interior. They brought thousands of free and\nenslaved workers to live in the Swamp and made them harvest wood,\nexcavate canals, and drain fields. Certain findings suggest that the Swamp’s \nhidden communities might have switched to a more \ndefensive mode during this period. But researchers also observed more \nmass-produced objects from this time, indicating that trading was taking place. Researchers think that the secret \nSwamp communities dispersed during or soon after \nthe American Civil War, by the end of which slavery was abolished\nin the United States. Some people may have stayed in the\nSwamp until they passed away or left to settle elsewhere. Most of what we know about these hidden\ncommunities has come to light after archeologists excavated sections\nof a single island. However, there may have been hundreds\nof habitable islands dotting the Swamp’s interior at the time. Between 1600 and 1860, many people lived \nin these hidden settlements. Some probably lived their entire lives\nwithin the Swamp and never saw a white person \nor experienced racial persecution in broader American society. Generations of Black Maroons \nand Indigenous Americans resisted slavery and colonization \nby creating an independent society in the heart of the Great Dismal Swamp. They fostered a refuge in what might seem \nlike the unlikeliest of places— but one that was more hospitable\nthan what lay outside. Today, this area offers a partial record\nof that secret, self-reliant world, imagined and built for survival \nand the preservation of freedom."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Great Dismal Swamp is located in the states of _______________ and ________________ in the United States.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Delaware and Maryland"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Michigan and Ohio"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Georgia and Louisiana"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Virginia and North Carolina"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "We know that Indigenous American use of the swamp area goes back to around __________ BCE", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "11,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "28,000"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After the early 1600s in the Mid-Atlantic region, African Americans Maroons were people who________________", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Worked in factories"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Survived terrible shipwrecks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Escaped enslavement"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Owned tracts of urban land"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Archaeologists discovered that Maroon-and-Indigenous American communities in the 200 years before the Civil War repurposed ____________ that were left behind by ancient people who had lived in the same locations.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wood posts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rubber hoses"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stone tools"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ship parts"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "It was around the turn of the ______________ that the social world of the swamp and its interior communities changed dramatically because of the encroachment of canal and lumber companies.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "17th Century"}, {"label": "B", "text": "18th Century"}, {"label": "C", "text": "19th Century"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20th Century"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

She's an actress, she's in her 60s. She's super bright, badass, emotionally intelligent. And a couple of days before Christmas,\nshe was at the post office. It was really crowded,\nas it is around the holidays, and she was filling out some forms and she was really focused. And out of nowhere,\nsomeone moved her out of the way -- just physically put their hands on her\nand moved her out of the way. He apparently needed something\nthat she was blocking, so he moved her. Maybe he had said something to her,\nmaybe he didn't, she didn't hear it ... Either way, she was focused,\nshe was filling out the form. And the next thing you know,\nthere were hands on her, and she was being moved out of the way. He then got what he was reaching for, whatever she was blocking, and went on his merry way. She said that she was shocked at first -- yeah. And then a fury rose up in her\nthat she could not explain: not annoyance, not frustration, but \"fury\" was the word that she used. And she went on to say, \"I mean, I wanted to get physical. I don't know -- I was furious. And I don't know why. I mean, he didn't hit me. He didn't hurt me, he didn't violate me. He moved me, and I wanted to hurt him, or at the very least, run after him and yell in his face.\" So later, I was left pondering this fury, and looking for an explanation as to why,\neven in her telling of it, I felt fury, too, and why this was a word and a feeling\nthat I was hearing a lot about lately. I feel like this is the point in the room where all the men are getting\na little bit uncomfortable. (Laughter) It's OK. Stay with me. This fury is something\nthat I have been chomping on since the last US presidential election. And it seems that many women have. This fury was not my friend's alone. Her fury was ignited by lifetimes of men\nhelping themselves to women's bodies without consent. There's a culture of men\nhelping themselves to women, and in this case, in a seemingly innocuous way, where a woman's body is like a saltshaker: \"Get out of the way\nso I can get to the fries\" -- (Laughter) to the most egregious, violent and horrific situations. I imagine that some of you\nare wondering what the connection is between the innocuous and the horrific, two things that seem to be\non opposite ends of the spectrum. Well, the common thread is the spectrum. The innocuous makes space\nfor the horrific. And women have to live\nwith the effects of both and everything in between. Fellas, can you imagine you're just on your phone, and someone walks up to you\nand just takes it out of your hand? And they're like, \"OK dude,\nI don't know why you're getting so upset, I want to make a phone call. I'm going to give it back to you\nas soon as I'm done. Whatever.\" And then imagine if someone takes\nthat cell phone out of your hands -- I don't know -- once a day, twice a day, random times. And the explanation is, \"Yeah, well, I mean,\nyou got a fancy case,\" or \"You shouldn't have\ntaken it out of your pocket,\" or \"Yep. Yeah. That's just the way it is.\" But somehow, no one ever talks about\nthe person who took the cell phone. Overly simplified, I get it, but you see where I'm going. Men are so used to helping\nthemselves, that it's like ... they can't help themselves. And not because men\nare fundamentally less moral, but because this is a very big\nblind spot for most men. When someone helps themselves to a woman, it not only triggers\ndiscomfort and distress, but the unspoken experiences\nof our mothers' lives, sisters' lives and generations of women before us. That's lifetimes of women dealing with men who assume they know better for us\nthan we know for ourselves, being the property of husbands, landowners, and having old, white men tell us\nthe fate of our lady parts; lifetimes of having our bodies used\nfor love and objects of desire, instead of bodies that we get to wield\nand use as we choose; lifetimes of knowing that whether\nwe play by their rules or not, we still have to tolerate harassment, assault and even worse; lifetimes of our bodies being used\nas property that can be hit and hurt, manipulated and moved and like objects that are not\ndeserving of respect; lifetimes of not being able to express\nthe anger of our bodies. It's no wonder we feel this fury. And if you add in the history of race -- which is a whole other talk -- it gets exponentially more complicated. When women get manhandled,\nwe start to rationalize, try to figure out the ways that it was -- \"It was probably our fault. You know what? He probably said\nsomething, and I didn't hear him. I'm just overreacting. I'm totally overreacting.\" No. No. No. No, no, no, no, no. Women have been trained\nto think that we are overreacting or that we're being too sensitive\nor unreasonable. We try to make sense of nonsense, and we swallow the furious feelings. We try to put them into\nsome hidden place in our minds, but they don't go away. That fury sits deep inside\nas we practice our smiles -- (Giggling) \"Yes, of course\" -- and try to be pleasant. \"I know --\" (Giggling)\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" because apparently, women\naren't supposed to get angry. That fury that my friend felt\nholds centuries of never being able to directly address\nor express our indignation, our frustration and our rage. When someone thinks\nthey can help themselves to our bodies, it not only ignites the current fury, but it lights up the past. What seems like a benign moment\nat the post office is actually an anger grenade. Well, kaboom! Today, the global collection\nof women's experiences can no longer be ignored. Time's up on thinking\nthat we're overreacting or \"This is just the way it is.\" Time's up on women being held responsible for men's bad behavior. It is men's responsibility\nto change men's bad behavior. (Applause) Our culture is shifting, and it's time. So my fellow women and our gentle men, as we are here together\nwithin this particular window of this large-scale movement\ntowards women's equality, and as we envision a future\nthat does not yet exist, we both have different invitations. Men, I call you in as allies, as we work together towards change. May you be accountable\nand self-reflective, compassionate and open. May you ask how you can support a woman\nand be of service to change. And may you get help if you need it. And women, I encourage you to acknowledge your fury. Give it language. Share it in safe places of identification and in safe ways. Your fury is not something\nto be afraid of. It holds lifetimes of wisdom. Let it breathe and listen. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you.

{"page": 7, "lesson": 8, "title": "How do you know what's true? - Sheila Marie Orfano", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-trust-your-memory-sheila-marie-orfano", "transcript": {"en": "A samurai is found dead \nin a quiet bamboo grove. One by one, the crime’s only known \nwitnesses recount their version of the events that transpired. But as they each tell their tale, it becomes clear that every testimony\nis plausible, yet different. And each witness implicates themselves. This is the premise of “In a Grove,”\na short story published in the early 1920s by Japanese author Ryūnosuke Akutagawa. Though many know this tale of warring\nperspectives by a different name: “Rashomon.” In 1950, Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa\nadapted two of Akutagawa’s stories into one film. This movie introduced the world \nto an enduring cultural metaphor that has transformed our understanding \nof truth, justice and human memory. The Rashomon effect describes a situation in which individuals give significantly \ndifferent but equally conceivable accounts of the same event. Often used to highlight the unreliability \nof eyewitnesses, the Rashomon effect usually occurs\nunder two specific conditions. The first: there’s no evidence \nto verify what really happened. And the second: there’s pressure\nto achieve closure, often provided by an authority figure\ntrying to identify the definitive truth. But the Rashomon effect undermines the \nvery idea of a singular, objective truth. In the source material, Akutagawa and Kurosawa use \nthe tools of their media to give each character’s testimony\nequal weight, transforming each witness \ninto an unreliable narrator. Without any hints on who’s sharing \nthe most accurate account, the audience can’t tell which\ncharacter to trust. Instead, each testimony takes\non a truthful quality, and the audience is left doubting \ntheir convictions as they guess who ended \nthe samurai’s life. Some might find this frustrating because \nthe plot subverts expectations of how mysteries usually end. But by refusing to provide a clear answer, these two artists capture the messiness\nand complexity of truth and human memory. Neuroscientists have found \nthat when we form a memory, our interpretation of visual information\nis influenced by our previous experiences \nand internal biases. Some of these biases are unique \nto individuals, but others are more universal. For example, egocentric bias \ncan influence people to subconsciously reshape their memories in ways that cast a positive light \non their actions. Even if we were able to encode\na memory accurately, recalling it incorporates new information\nthat changes the memory. And when we later recall that event, we typically remember the embellished\nmemory instead of the original experience. These underlying psychological\nphenomena mean that the Rashomon effect can pop up anywhere. In biology, scientists starting \nfrom the same dataset and applying the same analytical methods, \nfrequently publish different results. Anthropologists regularly grapple with \nthe impact personal backgrounds can have on an expert's perception. In one famous case, two anthropologists\nvisited the Mexican village of Tepoztlan. The first researcher described life \nin the town as happy and contented, while the second recorded residents\nas paranoid and disgruntled. Experts aside, the Rashomon effect can\nalso impact the general public, particularly when it comes to the \nperception of complicated world events. For example, following a 2015\nsecurity summit between the United States \nand leaders from the Arab States, media reports about the summit\nvaried enormously. Some stated that it had gone smoothly,\nwhile others called it a complete failure. It's tempting to fixate on why we\nhave competing perceptions, but perhaps the more important question \nthe Rashomon effect raises is, what is truth anyway? Are there situations when \nan “objective truth” doesn’t exist? What can different versions \nof the same event tell us about the time, place and people involved? And how can we make group decisions \nif we’re all working with different information, backgrounds, \nand biases? Like most questions, \nthese don’t have a definitive answer.

{"page": 7, "lesson": 9, "title": "Can you be awake and asleep at the same time? - Masako Tamaki", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-be-awake-and-asleep-at-the-same-time-masako-tamaki", "transcript": {"en": "Many animals need sleep. Even brainless jellyfish enter \nsleep-like states where they pulse less and respond more slowly \nto food and movement. But all of the threats and demands \nanimals face don’t just go away when it’s time to doze. That’s why a range of birds and mammals \nexperience some degree of asymmetrical sleep where parts \nof their brain are asleep and other areas are more active. This is even true for humans. So how does it work? All vertebrate brains consist \nof two hemispheres: the right and left. Brain activity is usually similar \nacross both during sleep. But during asymmetrical sleep, one brain hemisphere can be in deep sleep\nwhile the other is in lighter sleep. And in an extreme version \ncalled “unihemispheric sleep,” one hemisphere may appear completely awake\nwhile the other is in deep sleep. Take bottlenose dolphins. Their breathing is consciously controlled, and they must surface for air every \nfew minutes or they’ll drown. When they have a newborn calf, they must\nactually swim nonstop for weeks in order to keep it safe. So dolphins sleep unihemispherically,\nwith just one hemisphere at a time. This allows them to continue swimming\nand breathing while snoozing. Other marine mammals also\nneed asymmetrical sleep. Fur seals might spend weeks on end \nmigrating at sea. They slip into unihemispheric sleep\nwhile floating horizontally, holding their nostrils above the surface,\nclosing their upward-facing eye, and keeping their\ndownward-facing eye open. This may help them stay alert\nto threats from the depths. Similar pressures keep birds\npartially awake. Mallard ducks sleep in groups, but some\nmust inevitably be on the peripheries. Those ducks spend more time \nin unihemispheric sleep, with their outward-facing eyes open and their corresponding\nbrain hemispheres more active. Other birds have been shown to catch z’s\nin midair migration. While undertaking non-stop transoceanic \nflights of up to 10 days, frigatebirds either sleep with one\nor both hemispheres at a time. They do so in seconds-long bursts,\nusually while riding air currents. But the frigatebirds still sleep \nless than 8% of what they would on land, suggesting a great tolerance\nfor sleep deprivation. It’s currently unclear whether\nasymmetrical sleep packs the same benefits as sleep \nin both hemispheres and how this varies across species. In one experiment, fur seals relied \non asymmetrical sleep while being constantly stimulated. But in recovery, they showed \na strong preference for sleep across both hemispheres, suggesting that it was more restorative \nfor them. Dolphins, on the other hand, have been observed to maintain high levels\nof alertness for at least five days. By switching which hemisphere is awake, they get several hours of deep sleep \nin each hemisphere throughout a 24-hour period. This may be why unihemispheric sleep alone\nmeets their needs. So, what about humans? Have you ever woken up groggy after\nyour first night in a new place? Part of your brain might’ve spent\nthe night only somewhat asleep. For decades, scientists have recognized\nthat participants sleep poorly their first night in the lab. It’s actually customary to toss\nout that night’s data. In 2016, scientists discovered \nthat this “first night effect” is a very subtle version \nof asymmetrical sleep in humans. They saw that, during the first night, participants experience deeper sleep\nin their right hemisphere and lighter sleep in their left. When exposed to infrequent sounds, that lighter sleeping left hemisphere\nshowed greater bumps in activity. Participants also woke up and responded\nto infrequent sounds faster during the first night than \nwhen experiencing deep sleep in both hemispheres \nduring nights following. This suggests that, like other animals, humans use asymmetrical sleep\nfor vigilance, specifically in unfamiliar environments. So, while your hotel room is obviously\nnot trying to eat you and you’re not going to die \nif you don’t continue moving, your brain is still keeping you alert.

In that single intake of air, your lungs swelled with roughly\n25 sextillion molecules, ranging from compounds produced days ago, to those formed billions of years \nin the past. In fact, many of the molecules \nyou’re breathing were likely exhaled by members \nof ancient civilizations and innumerable humans since. But what exactly are we all breathing? Roughly 78% of Earth’s atmosphere\nis composed of nitrogen generated by volcanic activity \ndeep beneath the planet’s crust. The next major ingredient is oxygen,\naccounting for 21% of Earth’s air. While oxygen molecules have been around\nas long as Earth’s oceans, oxygen gas didn’t appear until \nocean dwelling microorganisms evolved to produce it. Finally, .93% of our air is argon, a molecule formed from the radioactive\ndecay of potassium in Earth’s atmosphere, crust, and core. Together, all these dry gases \nmake up 99.93% of each breath you take. Depending on when and where you are,\nthe air may also contain some water vapor. But even more variable \nis that remaining .07%, which contains a world of possibilities. This small slice of air is composed\nof numerous small particles including pollen, fungal spores, \nand liquid droplets, alongside trace gases\nlike methane and carbon dioxide. The specific cocktail of natural \nand man-made compounds changes dramatically from place to place. But no matter where you are, .07% of every breath you take \nlikely contains man-made pollutants— potentially including toxic compounds \nthat can cause lung disease, cancer, and even DNA damage. There’s a wide variety of known pollutants\nbut they all fall into two categories. The first are primary pollutants. These toxic compounds are directly emitted from a man-made \nor naturally occurring source. However, they don't always come\nfrom the places you'd expect. Some large factories mostly generate \nwater vapor, with only small quantities of pollutants \nmixed in. Conversely, burning wood or dung can \ncreate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; dangerous compounds that have been \nlinked to several types of cancer, as well as long-term DNA damage. In all cases, pollutants interact with\nregional weather patterns and topography, which can keep compounds local \nor spread them kilometers away. When these molecules travel \nthrough the air, a transformation occurs. Natural compounds called oxidants,\nformed by oxygen and sunlight, break down the pollutants. Sometimes, these reactions make pollutants\nmore easily washed out by rain. But in other cases, they result \nin even more toxic secondary pollutants. For example, when factories burn coal, they release high concentrations\nof sulfur oxides. These molecules oxidize to form sulfates, which condense with water vapor in the air\nto form a blanket of fine particles that impair visibility \nand cause severe lung damage. This so-called sulfurous smog was \nwell-known in 20th century London and continues to plague cities \nlike Beijing. Since the advent of cars, another secondary pollutant \nhas taken center stage. Exhaust from fossil fuel-burning vehicles\nreleases nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons which react to form ozone. And while some ozone \nin the upper atmosphere helps shield us from ultraviolet rays,\non the ground, this gas can form alongside secondary\nparticles and create photochemical smog. This brown fog can be found covering\ndensely packed cities, making seeing difficult \nand breathing hazardous. It also contributes to climate change\nby trapping heat in the atmosphere. In recent decades, industrial activity\nhas contributed to a huge spike in various trace gas emissions, fundamentally changing the air \nwe all breathe. Many places have already responded\nwith countermeasures.

Now, all that remains is to unleash \nthem on the world. But wait— what’s this? Ah, yes, there’s one more challenge. \nThey must now across the valley of death. All new products must pass through \nhere before they reach the market. Many never make it out, \nand sometimes that’s OK— if they don’t work, don’t fill a need, \nor for any number of other reasons. But inventions that could help address\nmassive global issues also face this risk. That’s because a technology’s potential\nisn’t the only factor that determines whether it will succeed. The valley of death is especially risky \nfor innovations involving complex physical objects \nas opposed to software, and for those in highly regulated\nindustries, like medicine, building materials, \nand transportation. Regulations and other obstacles \naren’t inherently bad— they’re often designed\nto keep people safe— but they do tend to scare off investors, and that’s what traps good ideas \nin the valley of death: their funding dries up before \nthey can become profitable. One of the fields where this problem \nis most pressing today is zero-carbon technologies. They’re essential to our future because they will help us eliminate \ngreenhouse gas emissions and stabilize our climate. But they also have features that make \nthem particularly vulnerable in the valley of death. Let’s look at why that is, \nand how we can change it. All new technologies must go \nthrough a development phase before they can become profitable. For zero-carbon technologies, the costs of this phase are high,\nthe timelines are long, and, in spite of the good they can do, demand is often low because they can \nrequire big changes in both infrastructure \nand consumer behavior. For example, electric heat pumps\ndon’t burn fossil fuels and, when you factor in savings on energy use, are cost-competitive with gas furnaces, but homeowners only change their heating\nand cooling systems every few decades. Direct air capture technologies, \nmeanwhile, remove CO2 directly from the atmosphere. We need these technologies \nto reach our emissions goals, and several of them have already\nbeen proven to work, but they’re at risk of getting trapped \nin the valley of death because they're expensive. This creates a vicious cycle because \nthe best way to lower costs is by, well, practicing: \nmaking more of a product and refining it. But high initial costs \nscare off investors, and without their money, companies can’t continue to develop \ntheir technologies— and can't ultimately decrease costs. Fortunately, there’s a way\nto break this cycle: governments can help close the gap, when private investors won’t fund\ntechnologies with such a high potential \nfor social benefit. This isn’t just theoretical: in the 1990s, \nfunctioning solar panels existed, but weren’t widely adopted \nbecause of their cost. To change this, Germany offered government\nloans to companies creating solar panels, and legally obligated utility companies to buy electricity produced \nusing renewable energy. The U.S. and China followed suit \nby financing major solar panel projects. The cost of solar has dropped \nalmost 90% since 2009, making it much easier to adopt. A similar thing happened for wind energy: during the oil crisis of the 1970s,\nDenmark invested in wind power and started taxing winds’ \nfossil fuel-based competitors. Other countries took similar steps, and as more wind power was\ngenerated worldwide, the costs of this technology\ndropped dramatically. These success stories tell us \nthat government initiatives work— initiatives like boosting spending \non research and development, offering tax and loan incentives \nto startups that want to develop \nzero-carbon technologies and consumers who want to buy them,\nand putting a price on carbon emissions. We need governments\nto do what they did for solar and wind for many more innovations. At the end of the day, \nideas and inventions alone can’t solve our most daunting problems— policies and markets have to be shaped so the most promising technologies\ncan succeed."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The valley of death is __________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The place where outdated products are discarded"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The phase before new products become profitable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The phase where ideas are trapped if the product already exists"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Where products end up if their demand is low"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why don’t zero carbon technologies survive the valley of death?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their development cost is high and production timeline is long"}, {"label": "B", "text": "There is low demand for them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They require big changes in infrastructure and consumer behavior"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Any of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who can fund the development of new products when private investors don’t?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The consumers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Like-minded companies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The government"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Since 2009, the cost of solar power dropped by almost _________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "90%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100%"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Of these countries, which one was the first to invest in wind power?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The United States"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germany"}, {"label": "C", "text": "China"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Denmark"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Pavlac", "category": "Philosophy & Religion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/a-brief-history-of-the-devil-brian-a-pavlac", "transcript": {"en": "Satan, the beast crunching sinners’ bones\nin his subterranean lair. Lucifer, the fallen angel raging \nagainst the established order. Mephistopheles, the trickster striking \ndeals with unsuspecting humans. These three divergent devils are all based\non Satan of the Old Testament, an angelic member of God’s court \nwho torments Job in the Book of Job. But unlike any of these literary devils, the Satan of the Bible was \na relatively minor character, with scant information about his deeds \nor appearance. So how did he become the ultimate \nantagonist, with so many different forms? In the New Testament, \nSatan saw a little more action: tempting Jesus,\nusing demons to possess people, and finally appearing as a giant dragon \nwho is cast into hell. This last image particularly inspired\nmedieval artists and writers, who depicted a scaled, shaggy-furred\ncreature with overgrown toenails. In Michael Pacher’s painting \nof St. Augustine and the Devil, the devil appears as an upright lizard— with a second miniature face \nglinting on his rear and. The epitome of these monster Satans appeared in Italian poet \nDante Alighieri’s “Inferno.” Encased in the ninth circle of hell, Dante’s Satan is a three-headed,\nbat-winged behemoth who feasts on sinners. But he’s also an object of pity: powerless as the panicked beating \nof his wings only encases him further in ice. The poem’s protagonist escapes from hell\nby clambering over Satan’s body, and feels both disgust and sympathy\nfor the trapped beast— prompting the reader to consider\nthe pain of doing evil. By the Renaissance, the devil started\nto assume a more human form. Artists painted him as a man \nwith cloven hooves and curling horns inspired by Pan,\nthe Greek god of the wild. In his 1667 masterpiece “Paradise Lost,” English poet John Milton depicted\nthe devil as Lucifer, an angel who started a rebellion \non the grounds that God is too powerful. Kicked out of heaven, \nthis charismatic rebel becomes Satan, and declares that he’d rather rule in hell\nthan serve in heaven. Milton’s take inspired numerous depictions\nof Lucifer as an ambiguous figure, rather than a purely evil one. Milton’s Lucifer later became an iconic\ncharacter for the Romantics of the 1800s, who saw him as a hero who defied higher\npower in pursuit of essential truths, with tragic consequences. Meanwhile, in the German legend \nof Doctor Faust, which dates to the 16th century, we get a look at what happens \nwhen the devil comes to Earth. Faust, a dissatisfied scholar, pledges his soul to the devil\nin exchange for bottomless pleasure. With the help \nof the devil’s messenger Mephistopheles, Faust quickly seizes \nwomen, power, and money— only to fall into the eternal fires \nof hell. Later versions of the story show\nMephistopheles in different lights. In Christopher Marlowe's account, a cynical Doctor Faustus is happy \nto strike a deal with Mephistopheles. In Johann Wolfgang van Goethe’s version, Mephistopheles tricks Faust\ninto a grisly deal. Today, a Faustian bargain refers \nto a trade that sacrifices integrity for short-term gains. In stagings of Goethe’s play, Mephistopheles appeared \nin red tights and cape. This version of the devil was often\nplayed as a charming trickster— one that eventually paraded \nthrough comic books, advertising, and film in his red suit. These three takes on the devil \nare just the tip of the iceberg: the devil continues to stalk \nthe public imagination to this day, tempting artists of all kinds \nto render him according to new and fantastical visions."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Satan first appears in the Biblical book titled", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exodus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chronicles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Job"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Judges"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In the Christian New Testament, the Devil does the following", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "possesses people through demons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fights as a giant dragon before being thrown into hell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "tempts Jesus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "By the Middle Ages, writers and artists portrayed the Devil as a", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "handsome fallen angel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "horrible monster made up of combined animal parts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "mysterious man in a fashionable black outfit"}, {"label": "D", "text": "clever con-man in a form-fitting red suit with horns and tail"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In his epic poem Paradise Lost, John Milton portrays Satan as", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a charismatic, yet tragic, fallen rebel against God"}, {"label": "B", "text": "a clownish jokester out to trap people into selling their souls"}, {"label": "C", "text": "an imaginary villain meant to frighten small children"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a mindless monster trying to destroy the world"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In Goethe’s Faust, the Devil who tempts the title character is named", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Beezelbub"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Old Nick"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lucifer Morningstar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mephistopheles"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The fact is, every world map humans\nhave ever made is wrong. Actually, it’s impossible to make a map\nof the world 100% right. No, not you, globe—\nwe know you’re accurate. Not you, Google Earth,\nyou’re just a digital globe. We're talking about flat maps, which,\nlet's face it, are way more convenient\nfor a lot of things. Anyway, as we were saying, it’s impossible to make a 100% accurate\nflat map of a spherical planet. For a long time, people didn't even try. They just plonked places down in arbitrary\nlocations without any consistent scale. Then in 150 AD, the Greek mathematician\nand astronomer Ptolemy systematically mapped the Earth on a grid and placed locations on the grid\naccording to coordinates, so maps could be checked against\nothers and replicated. Ptolemy built his grid out of lines\nwe still use today: 180 lines of latitude\nand 360 lines of longitude. In spite of these advances,\npeople kept getting lost. Part of the problem was a— shall we say— incomplete understanding\nof the world’s geography. But it was also just really difficult\nto navigate using a map. Because the Earth is round, the shortest route from one place\nto another is a path along a circle. If we draw this route on a flat map, it passes through every line of longitude\nat a different angle. To follow the route,\nyou’d have to constantly shift the direction you're traveling. Any slight error would land\nyou in the wrong place. In 1569, Gerardus Mercator\nfixed this problem. He created a world map proportioned so these curved navigational routes\nwould be straight, passing through every line\nof longitude at the same angle and therefore allowing navigators\nto set a constant bearing— in other words, travel in one direction—\nfor a whole journey. There was just one tiny hitch: to do this, he had to distort land masses\nand bodies of water so those furthest\nfrom the equator got larger and those closest\nto the equator shrank. In spite of its inaccuracies, Mercator’s\nmap was very useful. In fact, it’s still widely used today,\nincluding in online maps. But it’s still wrong! In 1925, the Goode Homolosine Projection\nwas created as— get this— an interrupted pseudo-cylindrical\nequal area projection. What does that mean?\nNot important. The point was to minimize\ndistortion for the entire world. The map can be land-oriented...\nor ocean-oriented. Either way, the so-called orange peel map\nisn’t very easy to read. The Dymaxion Projection by American\narchitect Buckminster Fuller in the 1940s is even better. Sorry,\ndid we say better? It’s not better if you want to understand\nwhere things are in the world. It is better in the sense that there are\nno visibly evident distortions of the land masses. Though if you wanted to know, say,\nhow far Brazil is from Nigeria, you won’t get any sense\nof that from this map. The most accurate projection to date\nis the AuthaGraph World Map designed by Japanese architect\nHajime Narukawa in 1999. The continents and oceans are almost\ncompletely in proportion, and the map is rectangular,\njust how we like it. Could this be the perfect map? Well... no. Since the Mercator works\nfor navigation and reads clearly, why bother with all these\nwhacky maps? Arno Peters argued that by enlarging\nEuropean and North American countries, the Mercator projection\ngives white nations a sense of supremacy over non-white nations\ncloser to the equator. He adapted the Gall-Peters Projection,\nwhich counteracts that particular problem, but the continents are still... stretched. Today, we rely on maps less and less\nfor navigation, but they still play a vital role\nin education. Peters was definitely on to something: no matter what map we’re looking at, it’s a story told from the perspective\nof the map’s creator that in turn shapes—perhaps unduly—\nour perception of our world. Simple changes in map design, even changes that have nothing\nto do with how we transfer a round Earth to a flat surface,\ncan completely shift our point of view."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who was the first person to use a grid and coordinates to make a map?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gerardus Mercator"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ptolemy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Copernicus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Arno Peters"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why is it that we don’t have a perfect map yet?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "No mapmaker has tried hard enough"}, {"label": "B", "text": "We have been waiting for technology to improve"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is impossible to make a 2D map from a 3D structure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We do!"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Goode-Homolosine Map is also known as", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The apple peel map"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The avocado map"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The orange peel map"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The banana peel map"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who created the Dymaxion Projection?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Buckminster Fuller"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gerardus Mercator"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Arno Peters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ptolemy"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the most accurate map projection to date?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gall-Peters projection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mercator projection"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Goode-Homolosine projection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Authagraph World Map"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 7, "lesson": 14, "title": "How much electricity does it take to power the world?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-much-electricity-does-it-take-to-power-the-world", "transcript": {"en": "You flip a switch. Coal burns in a furnace,\nwhich turns water into steam. That steam spins a turbine,\nwhich activates a generator, which pushes electrons\nthrough the wire. This current propagates through hundreds\nof miles of electric cables and arrives at your home. All around the world, countless people \nare doing this every second— flipping a switch, plugging in, \npressing an “on” button. So how much electricity \ndoes humanity need? The amount we collectively use\nis changing fast, so to answer this question, we need to know not just how much \nthe world uses today, but how much we’ll use in the future. The first step is understanding\nhow we measure electricity. It’s a little bit tricky. A joule is a unit of energy, but we usually don't measure\nelectricity in just joules. Instead, we measure it in watts. Watts tell us how much energy, \nper second, it takes to power something. One joule per second\nequals one watt. It takes about .1 watts\nto power a smart phone, a thousand to power your house,\na million for a small town, and a billion for a mid-size city. As of 2020, it takes 3 trillion watts\nto power the entire world. But almost a billion people don’t have\naccess to reliable electricity. As countries become more industrialized\nand more people join the grid, electricity demand is expected \nto increase about 80% by 2050. That number isn't the complete picture. We'll also have to use electricity\nin completely new ways. Right now, we power a lot of things\nby burning fossil fuels, emitting an unsustainable amount \nof greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. We’ll have to eliminate \nthese emissions entirely to ensure a sustainable future \nfor humanity. The first step to doing so,\nfor many industries, is to switch from fossil fuels \nto electric power. We'll need to electrify cars, switch buildings heated by natural gas\nfurnaces to electric heat pumps, and electrify the huge amount of heat\nused in industrial processes. So all told, global electricity needs\ncould triple by 2050. We’ll also need all that electricity \nto come from clean energy sources if it’s going to solve the problems \ncaused by fossil fuels. Today, only one third of the electricity\nwe generate comes from clean sources. Fossil fuels are cheap and convenient, \neasy to ship, and easy to turn into electricity \non demand. So how can we close the gap? Wind and solar power work great\nfor places with lots of wind and sunshine, but we can’t store and ship sunlight \nor wind the way we can transport oil. To make full use of energy from these \nsources at other times or in other places, we’d have to store it in batteries and improve our power grid infrastructure\nto transport it long distances. Meanwhile, nuclear power plants \nuse nuclear fission to generate carbon-free electricity. Though still more expensive\nthan plants that burn fossil fuels, they can be built anywhere and don’t depend on intermittent \nenergy sources like the sun or wind. Researchers are currently working \nto improve nuclear waste disposal and the safety of nuclear plants. There’s another possibility we’ve been \ntrying to crack since the 1940s: nuclear fusion. It involves smashing light atoms together,\nso they fuse, and harnessing the energy this releases. Accidents aren't a concern\nwith nuclear fusion, and it doesn't produce the long-lived\nradioactive waste fission does. It also doesn’t have \nthe transport concerns associated with wind, solar, \nand other renewable energy sources. A major breakthrough here could\nrevolutionize clean energy. The same is true of nuclear fission, \nsolar, and wind.

I had crippling cramps, I leaked blood onto my clothes\nand onto my bed sheets, and I had period diarrhea. And I had to miss school\none to two days a month, and I remember sitting on the couch\nwith my heating pads, thinking, \"What's up with this?\" When I ate food, I didn't leak saliva\nfrom my salivary glands. When I went for a walk, I didn't leak fluid from my knees, \n\"joint fluid.\" Why was menstruation so different? I wanted answers to these questions but there was no one for me to ask. My mother knew nothing about menstruation except that it was dirty and shameful\nand I shouldn't talk about it. I asked girlfriends and everybody spoke in euphemisms. And finally, when I got the courage\nto go to the doctor and talk about my heavy periods, I was told to eat liver. (Laughter) And when I went to the drug store\nto buy my menstrual products, my 48-pack of super maxi pads, back in the day when they were the size\nof a tissue box, each pad -- (Laughter) You know what I'm talking about. You have no idea how far\nabsorbent technology has come. (Laughter) I used to have to buy\nmy menstrual products in the feminine hygiene aisle. And I remember standing there, thinking, \"Well, why don't I buy toilet paper\nin the anal hygiene aisle?\" (Laughter) Like, what's up with that? Why can't we talk about periods? And it's not about the blood,\nas Freud would have you say, because if it were, there would be an ear, nose\nand throat surgeon up here right now, talking about the taboos\nof nose bleeds, right? And it's not even about periods, because otherwise, when we got rid\nof our toxic, shameful periods when we became menopausal, we'd be elevated\nto a higher social status. (Laughter) (Applause) It's just a patriarchal society is\ninvested in oppressing women, and at different points in our lives,\ndifferent things are used. And menstruation is used during what we in medicine call\nthe reproductive years. It's been around since\npretty much the beginning of time, many cultures thought\nthat women could spoil crops or milk, or wilt flowers. And then when religion came along, purity myths only made that worse. And medicine wasn't any help. In the 1920s and '30s there was the idea that women elaborated\nsomething called a menotoxin. We could wilt flowers just by walking by. (Laughter) And that's what happens\nwhen there's no diversity, right. Because there was no woman\nto put her hand up and go, \"Well, actually, that doesn't happen.\" And when you can't talk\nabout what's happening to your body, how do you break these myths? Because you don't even need to be a doctor to say that periods aren't toxic. If they were, why would an embryo\nimplant in a toxic swill? And if we all had this secret menotoxin, we could be laying waste\nto crops and spoiling milk. (Laughter) Why would we have not used\nour X-Women powers to get the vote sooner? (Laughter) (Applause) Even now, when I tweet about period diarrhea, as one does, (Laughter) I mention that it affects\n28 percent of women. And every single time,\nsomeone approaches me and says, \"I thought I was the only one.\" That's how effective\nthat culture of shame is, that women can't even share\ntheir experiences. So I began to think, \"Well, what if everybody knew\nabout periods like a gynecologist? Wouldn't that be great?\" Then you would all know what I know, you'd know that menstruation is a pretty unique\nphenomenon among mammals. Most mammals have estrus. Humans, some primates, some bats, the elephant shrew\nand the spiny mouse menstruate. And with menstruation what happens is\nthe brain triggers the ovary to start producing an egg. Estrogen is released and it starts to build up\nthe lining of the uterus, cell upon cell, like bricks. And what happens if you build\na brick wall too high without mortar? Well, it's unstable. So what happens when you ovulate? You release a hormone called progesterone, which is progestational,\nit gets the uterus ready. It acts like a mortar\nand it holds those bricks together. It also causes some changes to make the lining more hospitable\nfor implantation. If there's no pregnancy, (Whoosh) lining comes out, there's bleeding from the blood vessels\nand that's the period. And I always find this point\nreally interesting. Because with estrus, the final signaling to get\nthe lining of the uterus ready actually comes from the embryo. But with menstruation, that choice comes from the ovary. It's as if choice is coded in\nto our reproductive tracts. (Cheering and applause) OK, so now we know why the blood is there. And it's a pretty significant amount. It's 30 to 90 milliliters of blood, which is one to three ounces, and it can be more, and I know it seems like it's more\na lot of the times. I know. So why do we have so much blood? And why doesn't it just stay there\ntill the next cycle, right? Like, you didn't get pregnant,\nso why can't it hang around? Well imagine if each month it got thicker\nand thicker and thicker, right, like, imagine what tsunami\nperiod that would be. (Laughter) We can't reabsorb it,\nbecause it's too much. And it's too much because we need\na thick uterine lining for a very specific reason. Pregnancy exerts a significant\nbiological toll on our bodies. There is maternal mortality, there is the toll of breastfeeding and there is the toll of raising a child\nuntil it is independent. And evolution -- (Laughter) That goes on longer\nfor some of us than others. (Laughter) But evolution knows\nabout risk-benefit ratio. And so evolution wants to maximize\nthe chance of a beneficial outcome. And how do you maximize the chance\nof a beneficial outcome? You try to get the highest\nquality embryos. And how do you get\nthe highest quality embryos? You make them work for it. You give them an obstacle course. So over the millennia\nthat we have evolved, it's been a little bit\nlike an arms race in the uterus, the lining getting thicker\nand thicker and thicker, and the embryo getting more invasive until we reach this détente with the lining\nof the uterus that we have. So we have this thick uterine lining and now it's got to come out, and how do you stop bleeding? Well, you stop a nose bleed\nby pinching it, if you cut your leg,\nyou put pressure on it. We stop bleeding with pressure. When we menstruate, the lining of the uterus\nreleases substances that are made into chemicals\ncalled prostaglandins and other inflammatory mediators. And they make the uterus cramp down, they make it squeeze\non those blood vessels to stop the bleeding. They might also change\nblood flow to the uterus and also cause inflammation\nand that makes pain worse. And so you say, \"OK,\nhow much pressure is generated?\" And from studies\nwhere some incredible women have volunteered\nto have pressure catheters put in their uterus that they wear\ntheir whole menstrual cycle -- God bless them, because\nwe wouldn't have this knowledge without, and it's very important knowledge, because the pressure\nthat's generated in the uterus during menstruation is 120 millimeters of mercury. \"Well what's that,\" you say. Well, it's the amount of pressure\nthat's generated during the second stage of labor\nwhen you're pushing. (Audience gasps) Right. Which, for those of you\nwho haven't had an unmedicated delivery, that's what it's like\nwhen the blood pressure cuff is not quite as tight as it was\nat the beginning, but it's still pretty tight, and you wish it would stop. So that kind of makes it different, right? If you start thinking\nabout the pain of menstruation, we wouldn't say\nif someone needed to miss school because they were in the second stage\nof labor and pushing, we wouldn't call them weak. We'd be like, \"Oh my God,\nyou made it that far,\" right? (Laughter) And we wouldn't deny pain control to women who have\ntypical pain of labor, right? So it's important for us to call this pain\n\"typical\" instead of \"normal,\" because when we say it's normal,\nit's easier to dismiss. As opposed to saying it's typical,\nand we should address it. And we do have some ways\nto address menstrual pain. One way is with something\ncalled a TENS unit, which you can wear under your clothes and it sends an electrical impulse\nto the nerves and muscles and no one really knows how it works, but we think it might be\nthe gate theory of pain, which is counterirritation. It's the same reason why,\nif you hurt yourself, you rub it. Vibration travels faster\nto your brain than pain does. We also have medications called nonsteroidal\nanti-inflammatory medications. And what they do is they block\nthe release of prostaglandins. They can reduce menstrual pain\nfor 80 percent of women. They also reduce the volume of blood\nby 30 to 40 percent and they can help with period diarrhea. And we also have hormonal contraception, which gives us a thinner\nlining of the uterus, so there's less prostaglandins produced and with less blood,\nthere's less need for cramping. Now, if those treatments fail you -- and it's important to use\nthat word choice, because we never fail the treatment, the treatment fails us. If that treatment fails you, you could be amongst the people who have a resistance\nto nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. We don't quite understand, but there are some complex mechanisms why those medications\njust don't work for some women. It's also possible that you could have another reason for painful periods. You could have a condition\ncalled endometriosis, where the lining of the uterus\nis growing in the pelvic cavity, causing inflammation\nand scar tissue and adhesions. And there may be other mechanisms\nwe don't quite understand yet, because it's a possibility\nthat pain thresholds could be different due to very complex biological mechanisms. But we're only going to find that out\nby talking about it. It shouldn't be an act of feminism to know how your body works. It shouldn't -- (Applause) It shouldn't be an act of feminism to ask for help when you're suffering. The era of menstrual taboos is over. (Cheers and applause) The only curse here is the ability to convince\nhalf the population that the very biological machinery\nthat perpetuates the species, that gives everything that we have, is somehow dirty or toxic. And I'm not going to stand for it. (Applause) And the way we break that curse? It's knowledge. Thank you.

Pliny the Elder praised an imposing\nsea wall made from the stuff as “impregnable to the waves\nand every day stronger.” He was right: much of this construction\nstill stands, having survived millennia of battering \nby environmental forces that would topple modern buildings. Today, our roads, sidewalks, bridges, \nand skyscrapers are made of a similar, though \nless durable, material called concrete. There’s three tons of it for every person \non Earth. And over the next 40 years, \nwe’ll use enough of it to build the equivalent of New York City \nevery single month. Concrete has shaped our skylines, but that's not the only way\nit's changed our world. It’s also played a surprisingly large role\nin rising global temperatures over the last century, a trend that has already \nchanged the world, and threatens to even more drastically\nin the coming decades. To be fair to concrete, basically\neverything humanity does contributes to the greenhouse gas \nemissions that cause global warming. Most of those emissions come \nfrom industrial processes we often aren’t aware of, \nbut touch every aspect of our lives. Look around your home. Refrigeration— \nalong with other heating and cooling— makes up about 6% of total emissions. Agriculture, which produces our food,\naccounts for 18%. Electricity is responsible for 27%. Walk outside, and the cars zipping past,\nplanes overhead, trains ferrying commuters to work— transportation, including shipping, contributes 16% \nof greenhouse gas emissions. Even before we use any of these things,\nmaking them produces emissions— a lot of emissions. Making materials— concrete, steel, plastic, glass, \naluminum and everything else— accounts for 31%\nof greenhouse gas emissions. Concrete alone is responsible for 8% \nof all carbon emissions worldwide. And it’s much more difficult to reduce \nthe emissions from concrete than from other building materials. The problem is cement, \none of the four ingredients in concrete. It holds the other three ingredients—\ngravel, sand, and water— together. Unfortunately, it's impossible to make\ncement without generating carbon dioxide. The essential ingredient in cement\nis calcium oxide, CaO. We get that calcium oxide from limestone, which is mostly made of calcium carbonate:\nCaCO3. We extract CaO from CaCO3\nby heating limestone. What’s left is CO2— carbon dioxide. So for every ton of cement we produce,\nwe release one ton of carbon dioxide. As tricky as this problem is, it means concrete could help\nus change the world a third time: by eliminating greenhouse gas emissions\nand stabilizing our climate. Right now, there’s no 100% clean concrete, but there are some great ideas\nto help us get there. Cement manufacturing also produces\ngreenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels \nto heat the limestone. Heating the limestone with clean \nelectricity or alternative fuels instead would eliminate those emissions. For the carbon dioxide from\nthe limestone itself, our best bet is carbon capture: specifically, capturing the carbon\nright where it’s produced, before it enters the atmosphere. Devices that do this already exist, but they aren’t widely used because\nthere’s no economic incentive. Transporting and then storing \nthe captured carbon can be expensive. To solve these problems, one company has found a way to store\ncaptured CO2 permanently in the concrete itself. Other innovators are tinkering with \nthe fundamental chemistry of concrete. Some are investigating ways \nto reduce emissions by decreasing the cement in concrete. Still others have been working\nto uncover and replicate the secrets of Roman concrete. They found that Pliny’s remark \nis literally true. The Romans used volcanic ash \nin their cement. When the ash interacted with seawater,\nthe seawater strengthened it— making their concrete stronger and more \nlong-lasting than any we use today. By adding these findings to an arsenal \nof modern innovations, hopefully we can replicate their success— both by making long lasting structures, and ensuring our descendants can admire\nthem thousands of years from now."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "There are ____ of concrete per person in the world", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "500 pounds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3 tons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10 tons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "875 pounds"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Concrete accounts for _____of global greenhouse gases emissions", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "8 percent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "31 percent"}, {"label": "C", "text": "55 percent"}, {"label": "D", "text": "6 percent"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The four ingredients that make up concrete are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "cement, water, sand, gravel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "steel, cement, water, gravel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "water, gravel, sand and ash"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Glass, water, sand and cement"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following compounds is essential in making cement:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carbon Dioxide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Calcium Oxide"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ozone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hydrogen oxide"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "True or False: the ancient romans used volcanic ash and seawater to make concrete", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 7, "lesson": 17, "title": "How powerful is the world's biggest battery?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-powerful-is-the-world-s-biggest-battery", "transcript": {"en": "As of 2020, the world’s biggest \nlithium-ion battery is hooked up to the Southern California \npower grid and can provide 250 million watts \nof power, or enough to power about 250,000 homes. But it’s actually not the biggest battery\nin the world: these lakes are. Wait— how can a pair of lakes \nbe a battery? To answer that question, \nit helps to define a battery: it’s simply something that stores energy\nand releases it on demand. The lithium-ion batteries that power \nour phones, laptops, and cars are just one type. They store energy in lithium ions. To release the energy, the ions \nare separated from their electrons, then rejoined at the other end \nof the battery as a new molecule with lower energy. How do the two lakes \nstore and release energy? First, one is 300 meters higher \nthan the other. Electricity powers pumps that move\nbillions of liters of water from the lower lake to the higher one. This stores the energy by giving the water\nextra gravitational potential energy. Then, when there’s high demand\nfor electricity, valves open, releasing the stored energy \nby letting water flow downhill to power 6 giant turbines that can \ngenerate 3 billion watts of power for 10 hours. We’re going to need more and more \ngiant batteries. That’s because right now, generating\nenough electricity to power the world produces an unsustainable amount \nof greenhouse gas: 14 billion tons per year. We’ll need to get that number \ndown to net-zero. But many clean energy sources \ncan’t produce electricity 24/7. So to make the switch, we need a way to\nstore the electricity until it's needed. That means we need grid-scale batteries: batteries big enough \nto power multiple cities. Unfortunately, neither of the giant\nbatteries we’ve talked about so far can solve this problem. The two lakes setup requires specific\ngeography, takes up a lot of land, and has high upfront costs to build. The giant lithium-ion battery\nin California, meanwhile, can power about 250,000 homes, yes,\nbut only for an hour. Lithium-ion batteries are great for things\nthat don’t use a lot of power. But to store a lot of energy, \nthey have to be huge and heavy. That’s why electric planes aren’t a thing: the best electric plane \ncan only carry two people for about 1,000 kilometers on one charge, or its batteries would be too heavy \nto fly. A typical commercial jet can carry \n300 people over 14,000 km before refueling. Lithium-ion batteries also require \ncertain heavy metals to make. These resources are limited, and mining\nthem often causes environmental damage. Inventors all over the world are rising \nto the challenge of making batteries that can meet \nour needs— many of them even weirder \nthan the two lakes. One company is building \na skyscraper battery. When the sun is shining, \na crane powered by solar energy piles blocks on top of each other \nin a tower. At night, the cranes let gravity\npull the blocks down and use the resulting power \nto spin generators. Though there have been\nsome early setbacks, another promising approach involves\nheating up salts until they melt. The molten salt can be stored until \nthere’s a high demand for electricity, then used to boil water. The steam can power turbines\nthat generate electricity. Another idea: bio-batteries made \nfrom paper, powered by bacteria, and activated by spit. Bacteria release energy in the form \nof electrons when they metabolize glucose, and at least one species of bacteria can\ntransfer those electrons outside its cells,\ncompleting a circuit. While these batteries won’t power\na city, or even a house, they don't have the waste and cost\nconcerns of traditional batteries. From vast mountain lakes \nto microscopic bacteria, from seawater batteries\nthat bypass the need for heavy metals to nuclear batteries\nthat power deep space missions, we're constantly rethinking\nwhat a battery can be.

They come to in a kitchen, \ncaptives of a menacing chef. He boils up a pot of water \nand lobs one of the frogs in. But it’s having none of this. The second its toes hit the scalding water\nit jumps right out the window. The chef refills the pot, but this time \nhe doesn’t turn on the heat. He plops the second frog in,\nand this frog’s okay with that. The chef turns the heat on, very low, \nand the temperature of water slowly rises. So slowly that the frog doesn’t notice. In fact, it basks in the balmy water. Only when the surface begins to bubble\ndoes the frog realize: it’s toast. What’s funny about this parable is that\nit’s not scientifically true... for frogs. In reality, a frog will detect slowly\nheating water and leap to safety. Humans, on the other hand,\nare a different story. We’re perfectly happy to sit in the pot \nand slowly turn up the heat, all the while insisting it isn’t our hand\non the dial, arguing about whether we can \ntrust thermometers, and questioning— \neven if they’re right, does it matter? It does. Since 1850, global average temperatures \nhave risen by 1 degree Celsius. That may not sound like a lot, but it is. Why? 1 degree is an average. Many places have already gotten\nmuch warmer than that. Some places in the Arctic \nhave already warmed 4 degrees. If global average temperatures \nincrease 1 more degree, the coldest nights in the Arctic\nmight get 10 degrees warmer. The warmest days in Mumbai \nmight get 5 degrees hotter. So how did we get here? Almost everything that makes modern life\npossible relies on fossil fuels: coal, oil, and gas full of carbon \nfrom ancient organic matter. When we burn fossil fuels, we release carbon dioxide \nthat builds up in our atmosphere, where it remains for hundreds \nor even thousands of years, letting heat in, but not out. The heat comes from sunlight, which passes\nthrough the atmosphere to Earth, where it gets absorbed \nand warms everything up. Warm objects emit infrared radiation,\nwhich should pass back out into space, because most atmospheric gases \ndon’t absorb it. But greenhouse gases—\ncarbon dioxide and methane— do absorb infrared wavelengths. So when we add more of those gases \nto the atmosphere, less heat makes it back out to space, \nand our planet warms up. If we keep emitting greenhouse gases \nat our current pace, scientists predict temperatures\nwill rise 4 degrees from their pre-industrial levels by 2100. They’ve identified 1.5 degrees of warming— global averages half a degree warmer \nthan today’s— as a threshold beyond which \nthe negative impacts of climate change will become increasingly severe. To keep from crossing that threshold, we need to get our greenhouse gas \nemissions down to zero as fast as possible. Or rather, we have to get emissions\ndown to what's called net zero, meaning we may still be putting some\ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but we take out as much as we put in. This doesn’t mean we can just keep \nemitting and sequester all that carbon— we couldn’t keep up with our emissions \nthrough natural methods, and technological solutions would\nbe prohibitively expensive and require huge amounts\nof permanent storage. Instead, while we switch \nfrom coal, oil, and natural gas to clean energy and fuels, \nwhich will take time, we can mitigate the damage by removing\ncarbon from the atmosphere. Jumping out of the proverbial pot \nisn’t an option, but we can do something the frogs can’t: reach over, and turn down the heat."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Since 1850, global temperatures have increased by an average of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 Degree Fahrenheit"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3 Degrees Celsius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 Degree Celsius"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10 Degree Fahrenheit"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following are greenhouse gases", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Methane and Oxygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nitrogen and Oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carbon Dioxide and Nitrogen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Methane and Carbon Dioxide"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Scientists predict global average temperatures will rise by 4 degrees from preindustrial level by ____ if our current greenhouse gas emissions persist.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2050"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2033"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2200"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "____ degrees Celsius is the threshold for which climate change’s negative impacts will become increasingly severe.

what do you stand for these are two questions that i always begin my poetry workshops with students because at times poetry can seem like this dead art form for like old white men who just seem like they were born to be old like you know benjamin button or something and i asked my students these two questions and then i share how i answer them which is in these three sentences that go i am the daughter of black writers were descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world they call me and these are words i repeat in a mantra before every single poetry performance in fact i was like doing it in the corner over there i was like making faces um and so i repeat them to myself as a way to gather myself because i'm not sure if you know but public speaking is pretty terrifying um i know i'm on stage and i have my heels i look all glam but i'm horrified um and the way in which i kind of strengthen myself is by having this mantra most of my life i was particularly terrified of speaking up because i had a speech impediment which made it difficult to pronounce certain letters sounds and i felt like i was fine writing on the page once i got on stage i was worried my words might jumble and stumble what was the point in trying not to mumble these thoughts in my head if everything's already been said before but finally i had a moment of realization where i thought if i choose not to speak out of fear then there's no one that my silence is standing for and so i came to realize that i cannot stand standing to the side standing silent i must find the strength to speak up and one of the ways i do that is through this mantra where i call back to what i call honorary ancestors these are people who might not be related to you by blood or by birth but who are more than worth saying their names because you stand on the shoulders all the same and it's only from the height of these shoulders that we might have the sight to see the mighty power of poetry the power of language made accessible accessible poetry is interesting because not everyone is going to become a great poet but anyone can be and anyone can enjoy poetry and it's this openness this accessibility of poetry that makes it the language people poetry has never been the language barriers it's always been the language of bridges and it's this connection making that makes poetry yes powerful but also makes it political one of the things that irritates me to no end is when i get that phone call and it's usually from a white man and he's like man amanda we love your poetry we'd love to get you to write a poem about this subject but don't make it political which to me sounds like i have to draw a square but not make it a rectangle or like build a car and not make it a vehicle it doesn't make much sense because all art is political the decision to create the artistic choice to have a voice the choice to be heard is the most political act of all and by political i mean poetry is political at least three ways one what stories we tell when we're telling them how we're telling them if we're telling them why we're telling them so so much about the political beliefs we have about what types of stories matter secondly who gets to have those stories told i'm talking who is legally allowed to read who has the resources to be able to write who are we reading in our classrooms says a lot about the political and educational systems that all these stories and storytellers exist in lastly poetry is political because it's preoccupied with people if you look in history notice that tyrants often go after the poets and the creatives first they burn books they try to get rid of poetry in the language arts because they're terrified of them poets have this phenomenal potential to connect the beliefs of the private individual with the cause of change of the public the population the polity the political movement and when you leave here i really want you to try to hear the ways in which poetry is actually at the center on our most political questions about what it means to be a democracy maybe later you're going to be at a protest and someone's gonna have a poster that says they buried us but they didn't know we were seeds that's poetry you might be in your u.s history class and your teacher may play a video of martin luther king jr saying we will be able to hew out of this mountain of despair a stone of hope that's poetry or maybe even here in new york city you're going to go visit the statue of liberty where there's a sonnet that declares as americans give us you're tired you're poor your huddled masses yearning to be free so you see when someone asks me to write a poem that's not political what they're really asking me is to not ask charged and challenging questions in my poetic work and that does not work because poetry is always at the pulse of the most dangerous and the most daring questions that a nation or world might face what path do we stand on as a people and what future as a people do we stand for and the thing about poetry is that it's not really about having the right answers it's about asking these right questions about what it means to be a writer doing right by your words and your actions and my reaction is to pay honor to those shoulders of people who use those pens to roll over boulder so i might have a mountain of hope on which to stand so that i might understand the power of telling stories that matter no matter what so that i might realize that if i choose not out of fear but out of courage to speak then there's something unique that my words can become and all of a sudden that fear that my words my jumble and stumble go away as i'm humbled by the thoughts of thousands of stories a long time coming that i know are strumming inside me as i celebrate those people in their time who stood up so this little black girl could vine as i celebrate and call their names all the same these people who seemed like they were just born to be bold maya angelou and ozaki shanghai phyllis wheatley lucille clifton gwendolyn brooks joan wicks audrey lord and so many more it might feel like every story has been told before but the truth is no one's ever told my story in the way i would tell it as the daughter of black writers who were descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world they call me i call them and one day i'll write a story right by writing it into tomorrow on this earth more than worth standing for"}, "multiple-choice": []}

It might seem obvious at first. A second is the tick of a clock, the swing of a pendulum, \nthe time it takes to count to one. But how precise are those measurements? What is that length based on? And how can we scientifically define\nthis fundamental unit of time? For most of human history, \nancient civilizations measured time with unique calendars that tracked the steady march\nof the night sky. In fact, the second as we know it wasn’t\nintroduced until the late 1500’s, when the Gregorian calendar \nbegan to spread across the globe alongside British colonialism. The Gregorian calendar defined a day\nas a single revolution of the Earth about its axis. Each day could be divided into 24 hours,\neach hour into 60 minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds. However, when it was first defined, the second was more of a mathematical\nidea than a useful unit of time. Measuring days and hours was sufficient\nfor most tasks in pastoral communities. It wasn’t until society became\ninterconnected through fast-moving railways that cities\nneeded to agree on exact timekeeping. By the 1950’s, numerous global systems\nrequired every second to be perfectly accounted for,\nwith as much precision as possible. And what could be more precise\nthan the atomic scale? As early as 1955, researchers began\nto develop atomic clocks, which relied on the unchanging laws\nof physics to establish a new foundation\nfor timekeeping. An atom consists of negatively charged\nelectrons orbiting a positively charged nucleus\nat a consistent frequency. The laws of quantum mechanics \nkeep these electrons in place, but if you expose an atom \nto an electromagnetic field such as light or radio waves, you can slightly disturb an electron’s\norientation. And if you briefly tweak an electron\nat just the right frequency, you can create a vibration \nthat resembles a ticking pendulum. Unlike regular pendulums that quickly lose\nenergy, electrons can tick for centuries. To maintain consistency and make ticks \neasier to measure, researchers vaporize the atoms, converting them to a less interactive\nand volatile state. But this process doesn’t slow down\nthe atom’s remarkably fast ticking. Some atoms can oscillate \nover nine billion times per second, giving atomic clocks an unparalleled\nresolution for measuring time. And since every atom of a given\nelemental isotope is identical, two researchers using the same element\nand the same electromagnetic wave should produce perfectly\nconsistent clocks. But before timekeeping could\ngo fully atomic, countries had to decide which atom \nwould work best. This was the discussion in 1967, at the Thirteenth General Conference \nof the International Committee for Weights and Measures. There are 118 elements\non the periodic table, each with their own unique properties. For this task, the researchers were\nlooking for several things. The element needed to have long-lived and high frequency electron oscillation\nfor precise, long-term timekeeping. To easily track this oscillation, it also needed to have a reliably\nmeasurable quantum spin— meaning the orientation of the axis\nabout which the electron rotates— as well as a simple energy\nlevel structure— meaning the active electrons are few\nand their state is simple to identify. Finally, it needed to be easy to vaporize. The winning atom? Cesium-133. Cesium was already a popular\nelement for atomic clock research, and by 1968, some cesium clocks\nwere even commercially available. All that was left was to determine\nhow many ticks of a cesium atom were in a second. The conference used the most\nprecise astronomical measurement of a second available at the time— beginning with the number of days\nin a year and dividing down. When compared to the atom’s ticking rate, the results formally defined one second as exactly 9,192,631,770 ticks\nof a cesium-133 atom. Today, atomic clocks are used all over\nthe Earth— and beyond it. From radio signal transmitters \nto satellites for global positioning systems, these devices have been synchronized to help us maintain a globally\nconsistent time— with precision that’s second to none."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How did ancient civilizations measure time?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They used ocean tides"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They used unique calendars that tracked the night sky"}, {"label": "C", "text": "With the Gregorian calendar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "With the movement of the sun"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When was the second introduced?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "426 BCE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Late 1500’s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the 1800’s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1708"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What invention led to the need for exact time keeping?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fast-moving railways"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Atomic clocks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ships and trading routes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The internet"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How do atomic clocks measure time?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By using geolocation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By using radioactivity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By using the laws of physics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What qualities were researchers looking for to decide which element would work best for the atomic time?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The element needed to have long-lived and high frequency electron oscillation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The element needed to have reliable and measurable quantum spin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The element has to be easy to vaporize"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

You know, the blissfully happy family\nmoves in to their perfect new home, excited about their perfect future, and it's sunny outside\nand the birds are chirping ... And then it gets dark. And there are noises from the attic. And we realize that that perfect\nnew house isn't so perfect. When I started working at Google in 2006, Facebook was just a two-year-old, and Twitter hadn't yet been born. And I was in absolute awe\nof the internet and all of its promise to make us closer and smarter and more free. But as we were doing the inspiring work\nof building search engines and video-sharing sites\nand social networks, criminals, dictators and terrorists\nwere figuring out how to use those same\nplatforms against us. And we didn't have\nthe foresight to stop them. Over the last few years, geopolitical\nforces have come online to wreak havoc. And in response, Google supported a few colleagues and me\nto set up a new group called Jigsaw, with a mandate to make people safer\nfrom threats like violent extremism, censorship, persecution -- threats that feel very personal to me\nbecause I was born in Iran, and I left in the aftermath\nof a violent revolution. But I've come to realize\nthat even if we had all of the resources of all of the technology\ncompanies in the world, we'd still fail if we overlooked one critical ingredient: the human experiences of the victims\nand perpetrators of those threats. There are many challenges\nI could talk to you about today. I'm going to focus on just two. The first is terrorism. So in order to understand\nthe radicalization process, we met with dozens of former members\nof violent extremist groups. One was a British schoolgirl, who had been taken off of a plane\nat London Heathrow as she was trying to make her way\nto Syria to join ISIS. And she was 13 years old. So I sat down with her and her father,\nand I said, \"Why?\" And she said, \"I was looking at pictures\nof what life is like in Syria, and I thought I was going to go\nand live in the Islamic Disney World.\" That's what she saw in ISIS. She thought she'd meet and marry\na jihadi Brad Pitt and go shopping in the mall all day\nand live happily ever after. ISIS understands what drives people, and they carefully craft a message\nfor each audience. Just look at how many languages they translate their\nmarketing material into. They make pamphlets,\nradio shows and videos in not just English and Arabic, but German, Russian,\nFrench, Turkish, Kurdish, Hebrew, Mandarin Chinese. I've even seen an ISIS-produced\nvideo in sign language. Just think about that for a second: ISIS took the time and made the effort to ensure their message is reaching\nthe deaf and hard of hearing. It's actually not tech-savviness that is the reason why\nISIS wins hearts and minds. It's their insight into the prejudices,\nthe vulnerabilities, the desires of the people they're trying to reach that does that. That's why it's not enough for the online platforms\nto focus on removing recruiting material. If we want to have a shot\nat building meaningful technology that's going to counter radicalization, we have to start with the human\njourney at its core. So we went to Iraq to speak to young men\nwho'd bought into ISIS's promise of heroism and righteousness, who'd taken up arms to fight for them and then who'd defected after they witnessed\nthe brutality of ISIS's rule. And I'm sitting there in this makeshift\nprison in the north of Iraq with this 23-year-old who had actually\ntrained as a suicide bomber before defecting. And he says, \"I arrived in Syria full of hope, and immediately, I had two\nof my prized possessions confiscated: my passport and my mobile phone.\" The symbols of his physical\nand digital liberty were taken away from him on arrival. And then this is the way he described\nthat moment of loss to me. He said, \"You know in 'Tom and Jerry,' when Jerry wants to escape,\nand then Tom locks the door and swallows the key and you see it bulging out\nof his throat as it travels down?\" And of course, I really could see\nthe image that he was describing, and I really did connect with the feeling\nthat he was trying to convey, which was one of doom, when you know there's no way out. And I was wondering: What, if anything,\ncould have changed his mind the day that he left home? So I asked, \"If you knew everything that you know now about the suffering\nand the corruption, the brutality -- that day you left home, would you still have gone?\" And he said, \"Yes.\" And I thought, \"Holy crap, he said 'Yes.'\" And then he said, \"At that point, I was so brainwashed, I wasn't taking in\nany contradictory information. I couldn't have been swayed.\" \"Well, what if you knew\neverything that you know now six months before the day that you left?\" \"At that point, I think it probably\nwould have changed my mind.\" Radicalization isn't\nthis yes-or-no choice. It's a process, during which\npeople have questions -- about ideology, religion,\nthe living conditions. And they're coming online for answers, which is an opportunity to reach them. And there are videos online\nfrom people who have answers -- defectors, for example,\ntelling the story of their journey into and out of violence; stories like the one from that man\nI met in the Iraqi prison. There are locals who've uploaded\ncell phone footage of what life is really like\nin the caliphate under ISIS's rule. There are clerics who are sharing\npeaceful interpretations of Islam. But you know what? These people don't generally have\nthe marketing prowess of ISIS. They risk their lives to speak up\nand confront terrorist propaganda, and then they tragically\ndon't reach the people who most need to hear from them. And we wanted to see\nif technology could change that. So in 2016, we partnered with Moonshot CVE to pilot a new approach\nto countering radicalization called the \"Redirect Method.\" It uses the power of online advertising to bridge the gap between\nthose susceptible to ISIS's messaging and those credible voices\nthat are debunking that messaging. And it works like this: someone looking for extremist material -- say they search\nfor \"How do I join ISIS?\" -- will see an ad appear that invites them to watch a YouTube video\nof a cleric, of a defector -- someone who has an authentic answer. And that targeting is based\nnot on a profile of who they are, but of determining something\nthat's directly relevant to their query or question. During our eight-week pilot\nin English and Arabic, we reached over 300,000 people who had expressed an interest in\nor sympathy towards a jihadi group. These people were now watching videos that could prevent them\nfrom making devastating choices. And because violent extremism\nisn't confined to any one language, religion or ideology, the Redirect Method is now\nbeing deployed globally to protect people being courted online\nby violent ideologues, whether they're Islamists,\nwhite supremacists or other violent extremists, with the goal of giving them the chance\nto hear from someone on the other side of that journey; to give them the chance to choose\na different path. It turns out that often the bad guys\nare good at exploiting the internet, not because they're some kind\nof technological geniuses, but because they understand\nwhat makes people tick. I want to give you a second example: online harassment. Online harassers also work\nto figure out what will resonate with another human being. But not to recruit them like ISIS does, but to cause them pain. Imagine this: you're a woman, you're married, you have a kid. You post something on social media, and in a reply,\nyou're told that you'll be raped, that your son will be watching, details of when and where. In fact, your home address\nis put online for everyone to see. That feels like a pretty real threat. Do you think you'd go home? Do you think you'd continue doing\nthe thing that you were doing? Would you continue doing that thing\nthat's irritating your attacker? Online abuse has been this perverse art of figuring out what makes people angry, what makes people afraid, what makes people insecure, and then pushing those pressure points\nuntil they're silenced. When online harassment goes unchecked, free speech is stifled. And even the people\nhosting the conversation throw up their arms and call it quits, closing their comment sections\nand their forums altogether. That means we're actually\nlosing spaces online to meet and exchange ideas. And where online spaces remain, we descend into echo chambers\nwith people who think just like us. But that enables\nthe spread of disinformation; that facilitates polarization. What if technology instead\ncould enable empathy at scale? This was the question\nthat motivated our partnership with Google's Counter Abuse team, Wikipedia and newspapers like the New York Times. We wanted to see if we could build\nmachine-learning models that could understand\nthe emotional impact of language. Could we predict which comments\nwere likely to make someone else leave the online conversation? And that's no mean feat. That's no trivial accomplishment for AI to be able to do\nsomething like that. I mean, just consider\nthese two examples of messages that could have been sent to me last week. \"Break a leg at TED!\" ... and \"I'll break your legs at TED.\" (Laughter) You are human, that's why that's an obvious\ndifference to you, even though the words\nare pretty much the same. But for AI, it takes some training\nto teach the models to recognize that difference. The beauty of building AI\nthat can tell the difference is that AI can then scale to the size\nof the online toxicity phenomenon, and that was our goal in building\nour technology called Perspective. With the help of Perspective, the New York Times, for example, has increased spaces\nonline for conversation. Before our collaboration, they only had comments enabled\non just 10 percent of their articles. With the help of machine learning, they have that number up to 30 percent. So they've tripled it, and we're still just getting started. But this is about way more than just\nmaking moderators more efficient. Right now I can see you, and I can gauge how what I'm saying\nis landing with you. You don't have that opportunity online. Imagine if machine learning\ncould give commenters, as they're typing, real-time feedback about how\ntheir words might land, just like facial expressions do\nin a face-to-face conversation. Machine learning isn't perfect, and it still makes plenty of mistakes. But if we can build technology that understands the emotional\nimpact of language, we can build empathy. That means that we can have\ndialogue between people with different politics, different worldviews, different values. And we can reinvigorate the spaces online\nthat most of us have given up on. When people use technology\nto exploit and harm others, they're preying on our human fears\nand vulnerabilities. If we ever thought\nthat we could build an internet insulated from the dark side of humanity, we were wrong. If we want today to build technology that can overcome\nthe challenges that we face, we have to throw our entire selves\ninto understanding the issues and into building solutions that are as human as the problems\nthey aim to solve. Let's make that happen. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

It’s 1762 B.C.E., \nduring the reign of King Hammurabi. Beltani is a naditu —\na priestess and businesswoman, promised to the temple at birth. At puberty, she changed her name and gained her elevated naditu status \nin a ceremony where a priest examined the entrails \nof a sacrificed animal for omens. The naditu are an esteemed group drawn\nfrom Babylonia’s most affluent families. Though the rules are different for naditu\nin each city, in Sippar they are celibate\nand never marry. They live inside the gagum, \na walled area inside the temple complex, but are free to come and go,\nand receive visitors. Beltani owns barley fields and a tavern. Her brother manages these businesses while she fulfils her duties\nas a priestess. This morning, he makes \na troubling accusation: her tavern keeper has been diluting\nwine with water. If true, this means she’s been undermining\nthe business Beltani relies on to sustain her in old age. But the consequences would be even higher\nfor the tavern keeper: the punishment of diluting wine\nis death by drowning. The temple court is meeting\nthis afternoon. Beltani has just a few short hours to find out whether there’s any truth \nto these allegations. But she can’t go to the tavern\nto investigate. Taverns are off limits for priestesses,\neven priestesses who own them. She could be burned to death for entering. So she sends for the tavern keeper \nto meet her at the temple of Shamash, the patron god of Sippar. The temple is a stepped pyramid \ncalled a ziggurat, in the heart of the city \nand visible from twenty miles away. It symbolically connects heaven and earth and is viewed as the literal home\nof the god Shamash, who gave humanity the code of laws and is the judge \nof the Babylonian pantheon. Beltani leaves an offering of bread \nand sesame oil in a private room. She never enters the inner chamber \nof the temple where the god lives, a place so holy only high priestesses\nand kings visit. Outside, worshippers play music \nand leave gifts, which are later collected and used to feed\ntemple workers, including the naditu. The tavern keeper is waiting\nwith grim news. She says Beltani’s brother has been\naltering the weights used to measure payments\nto cheat customers. When the tavern keeper confronted him, he falsely accused her\nof watering down the wine. If true, Beltani’s brother \nis the dishonest one — and altering weights is another crime \npunishable by death. Beltani is running out of time\nto get to the bottom of this. Though she can’t go to the tavern, she can check on the barley fields \nher brother manages to see if he’s been honest there. In the granary, she sees much more grain \nthan he reported to her. He’s been cheating her out of her share. Like all naditu in Sippar, Beltani inherited the same portion \nof her father’s property as her brother. These were rare circumstances\nfor women in a time and place where property passed through men. Still, their families didn’t always honor\ntheir rights. Although naditu traditionally\nwent into business with male relatives, the law stated they can choose\nsomeone else if their brothers or uncles\nweren’t up to the task. With the evidence she needs, \nshe hurries to court. A judge presides over the temple court\nalong with two naditu — the overseer of the gagum and a scribe. Beltani asks to remove her brother \nas her business manager, citing the granary as evidence \nthat he is mismanaging her properties. The judge grants her request. The scribe records the new contract \nin cuneiform into a wet clay tablet, and the matter is settled. She's protected her income \nand spared her brother’s life by withholding the true extent \nof his crimes. Perhaps it is time to adopt\na younger priestess: someone to take care of her in old age\nand inherit her property, who might do a better job of helping\nwith her business."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Beltani invests in several business ventures.

{"page": 7, "lesson": 23, "title": "Why should you read Toni Morrison’s “Beloved”? - Yen Pham", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-toni-morrison-s-beloved-yen-pham", "transcript": {"en": "A mirror that shatters without warning. A trail of cracker crumbs \nstrewn across the floor. Two tiny handprints that appear on a cake. Everyone at 124 Bluestone Road\nknows their house is haunted— but there’s no mystery about \nthe spirit tormenting them. This ghost is the product \nof an unspeakable trauma; the legacy of a barbaric history that hangs over much more \nthan this lone homestead. So begins \"Beloved,\" Toni Morrison’s \nPulitzer Prize-winning novel about the suffering wrought by slavery\nand the wounds that persist in its wake. Published in 1987, \"Beloved\" \ntells the story of Sethe, a woman who escaped enslavement. When the novel opens, Sethe \nhas been living free for over a decade. Her family has largely dissolved—\nSethe’s mother-in-law died years earlier, and her two sons ran away \nfrom fear of the specter. Sethe’s daughter Denver remains \nin the house, but the pair live a half-life. Shunned by the wider community, the two have only each other \nand the ghost for company. Sethe is consumed by thoughts\nof the spirit, whom she believes to be \nher eldest daughter. When a visitor from Sethe’s old life\nreturns and threatens the ghost away, it seems like the start of a new beginning\nfor her family. But what comes in the ghost’s place\nmay be even harder to bear. As with much of Morrison’s work, \"Beloved\" investigates the roles of trauma\nand love in African-American history. Morrison writes about black identities\nin a variety of contexts, but her characters are united \nby their desire to find love and be loved— even when it’s painful. Some of her novels explore when love\nchallenges social conventions, like the forbidden affection that grows\nbetween the townsfolk of \"Paradise\" and their fugitive neighbors. Other works examine how we can be\nblind to the love we already possess. In \"Sula,\" one character realizes \nthat it’s not her marriage, but rather, one of her friendships \nthat embodies the great love of her life. Perhaps Morrison’s most famous\nexploration of the difficulty of love takes place in \"Beloved.\" Here, the author considers how \nthe human spirit is diminished when you know the things and people\nyou love most will be taken away. Morrison shows that slavery \nis destructive to love in all forms, poisoning both enslaved people\nand their enslavers. \"Beloved\" examines the dehumanizing\neffects of the slave trade in numerous ways. Some are straightforward, \nsuch as referring to enslaved people as animals with monetary value. But others are more subtle. Sethe and Paul D.—\nthe visitor from her old plantation— are described as trying \nto “live an unlivable life.” Their coping mechanisms are different;\nSethe remains mired in her past, while Paul D. dissociates\nhimself completely. But in both cases, it’s clear each\ncharacter has been irreparably scarred. Morrison also blends \nperspectives and timelines, to convey how the trauma of slavery ripples across various characters\nand time periods. As she delves into the psyche \nof townspeople, enslavers, and previously enslaved people, she exposes conflicting\nviewpoints on reality. This tension shows the limitations\nof our own perspectives, and the ways in which some characters are actively avoiding the reality\nof their actions. But in other instances, the characters’\nshifting memories align perfectly; capturing the collective trauma\nthat haunts the story. Though \"Beloved\" touches on dark subjects, the book is also filled \nwith beautiful prose, highlighting its characters’ capacity\nfor love and vulnerability. In a stream-of-consciousness sequence\nwritten from Sethe’s perspective, Morrison unspools memories of subjugation\nalongside moments of tenderness; like a baby reaching for her mother’s\nearrings, spring colors, and freshly painted stairs. Sethe’s mother-in-law had them\npainted white, she recalls, “so you could see your way to the top… \nwhere lamplight didn’t reach.\" Throughout the book, Morrison asks\nus to consider hope in the dark, and to question what freedom really means. She urges readers to ponder\nthe power we have over each other, and to use that power wisely. In this way, \"Beloved\" remains a testimony\nto the destructiveness of hate, the redeeming power of love, and the responsibility we bear\nto heed the voices of the past."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who does Sethe live with at 124 Bluestone Road?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Her mother-in-law Baby Suggs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Her daughter Denver"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Her husband Halle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stamp Paid, who helped Sethe escape to freedom"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who does Sethe believe the ghost is?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Her grandmother"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Her husband"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Her eldest daughter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Her former neighbor"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is one of the main themes explored in “Beloved”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Love and trauma in African-American history"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The role of religion in the lives of enslaved people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The most important battles of the Civil War"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Segregation and anti-miscegenation laws"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How does Sethe cope with the trauma of the past?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By dissociating and forgetting"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By drinking excessively"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By talking about it with Halle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By remaining mired in it"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "One of the literary techniques Morrison uses is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Onomatopoeia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stream-of-consciousness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Allusion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Foreshadowing"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
