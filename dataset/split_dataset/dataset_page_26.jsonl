Pondering deep questions? Excitement about a big trip? Or is it stress about unfinished work, an upcoming test, or a dreaded family gathering? For many people, this stress is temporary,\nas its cause is quickly resolved. But what if the very thing keeping \nyou awake was stress about losing sleep? This seemingly unsolvable loop \nis at the heart of insomnia, the world’s most common\nsleep disorder. Almost anything can cause \nthe occasional restless night - a snoring partner, physical pain, or emotional distress. And extreme sleep deprivation like jetlag\ncan throw off your biological clock, wreaking havoc on your sleep schedule. But in most cases, sleep deprivation \nis short-term. Eventually, exhaustion catches up \nwith all of us. However, some long-term conditions\nlike respiratory disorders, gastrointestinal problems, and many others can overpower fatigue. And as sleepless nights pile up, the bedroom can start to carry \nassociations of restless nights wracked with anxiety. Come bedtime, insomniacs are stressed. So stressed their brains hijack \nthe stress response system, flooding the body with \nfight-flight-or-freeze chemicals. Cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormones \ncourse through the bloodstream, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and jolting the body into hyperarousal. In this condition, the brain is hunting \nfor potential threats, making it impossible to ignore\nany slight discomfort or nighttime noise. And when insomniacs \nfinally do fall asleep, the quality of their rest is compromised. Our brain’s primary source of energy \nis cerebral glucose, and in healthy sleep, our metabolism slows\nto conserve this glucose for waking hours. But PET studies show the adrenaline \nthat prevents sleep for insomniacs also speeds up their metabolisms. While they sleep, their bodies \nare working overtime, burning through the brain’s supply \nof energy-giving glucose. This symptom of poor sleep leaves \ninsomniacs waking in a state of exhaustion,\nconfusion, and stress, which starts the\nprocess all over again. When these cycles of stress \nand restlessness last several months, they’re diagnosed as chronic insomnia. And while insomnia rarely leads to death, its chemical mechanisms are similar \nto anxiety attacks found in those experiencing depression\nand anxiety. So suffering from \nany one of these conditions increases your risk of\nexperiencing the other two. Fortunately, there are ways to break \nthe cycle of sleeplessness. Managing the stress that leads \nto hyperarousal is one of our best-understood treatments \nfor insomnia, and good sleep practices can help rebuild \nyour relationship with bedtime. Make sure your bedroom is dark \nand comfortably cool to minimize “threats” during hyperarousal. Only use your bed for sleeping, and if you’re restless, leave the room and tire yourself out \nwith relaxing activities like reading, meditating, or journaling. Regulate your metabolism by setting\nconsistent resting and waking times to help orient \nyour body’s biological clock. This clock, or circadian rhythm, is also sensitive to light, so avoid bright lights at night to help tell your body\nthat it’s time for sleep. In addition to these practices, some doctors prescribe medication \nto aid sleep, but there aren’t reliable medications \nthat help in all cases. And over-the-counter sleeping pills \ncan be highly addictive, leading to withdrawal \nthat worsens symptoms. But before seeking any treatment, make sure your sleeplessness \nis actually due to insomnia. Approximately 8% of patients diagnosed \nwith chronic insomnia are actually suffering from a less common\ngenetic problem called delayed sleep phase disorder,\nor DSPD. People with DSPD have a circadian rhythm \nsignificantly longer than 24 hours, putting their sleeping habits out \nof sync with traditional sleeping hours. So while they have difficulty \nfalling asleep at a typical bedtime, it’s not due to increased stress. And given the opportunity, they can sleep comfortably \non their own delayed schedule. Our sleeping and waking cycle \nis a delicate balance, and one that’s vital to maintain\nfor our physical and mental wellbeing. For all these reasons, it’s worth putting in some time \nand effort to sustain a stable bedtime routine, but try not to lose any sleep over it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When insomniacs sleep, what vital resource is not being adequately replenished?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cortisol"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cerebral glucose"}, {"label": "C", "text": "T-cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which two conditions often lead to or from insomnia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Attention deficient disorder (ADD) and dyslexia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Snoring and stress"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jet lag and delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Depression and anxiety"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When insomnia hijacks the stress response, it floods your body with______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Blood sugar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Immune response chemicals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fight-flight-or-freeze chemicals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "White blood cells"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these is NOT good sleep hygiene?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lying awake in bed until you fall asleep"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Avoiding bright lights before bed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Setting consistent times to go to sleep and wake up"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Keeping your room comfortably dark and cool"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What does DSPD stand for?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Deep sound phase disorder"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Detrimental sleep pain disorder"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Delayed sensing pain disorder"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Delayed sleep phase disorder"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 26, "lesson": 2, "title": "You can grow new brain cells. Here's how - Sandrine Thuret", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/1KY07tYL", "transcript": {"en": "Can we, as adults, grow new nerve cells? There's still some confusion\nabout that question, as this is a fairly new field of research. For example, I was talking\nto one of my colleagues, Robert, who is an oncologist, and he was telling me, \"Sandrine, this is puzzling. Some of my patients that have been told\nthey are cured of their cancer still develop symptoms of depression.\" And I responded to him, \"Well, from my point of view\nthat makes sense. The drug you give to your patients\nthat stops the cancer cells multiplying also stops the newborn neurons\nbeing generated in their brain.\" And then Robert looked at me\nlike I was crazy and said, \"But Sandrine, these are adult patients -- adults do not grow new nerve cells.\" And much to his surprise, I said,\n\"Well actually, we do.\" And this is a phenomenon\nthat we call neurogenesis. [Neurogenesis] Now Robert is not a neuroscientist, and when he went to medical school\nhe was not taught what we know now -- that the adult brain\ncan generate new nerve cells. So Robert, you know,\nbeing the good doctor that he is, wanted to come to my lab to understand the topic\na little bit better. And I took him for a tour of one of the most exciting\nparts of the brain when it comes to neurogenesis -- and this is the hippocampus. So this is this gray structure\nin the center of the brain. And what we've known already\nfor very long, is that this is important for learning,\nmemory, mood and emotion. However, what we\nhave learned more recently is that this is one of the unique\nstructures of the adult brain where new neurons can be generated. And if we slice through the hippocampus and zoom in, what you actually see here in blue is a newborn neuron\nin an adult mouse brain. So when it comes to the human brain -- my colleague Jonas Frisén\nfrom the Karolinska Institutet, has estimated that we produce\n700 new neurons per day in the hippocampus. You might think this is not much, compared to the billions\nof neurons we have. But by the time we turn 50, we will have all exchanged the neurons\nwe were born with in that structure with adult-born neurons. So why are these new neurons important\nand what are their functions? First, we know that they're important\nfor learning and memory. And in the lab we have shown that if we block the ability\nof the adult brain to produce new neurons in the hippocampus, then we block certain memory abilities. And this is especially new and true\nfor spatial recognition -- so like, how you navigate\nyour way in the city. We are still learning a lot, and neurons are not only important\nfor memory capacity, but also for the quality of the memory. And they will have been helpful\nto add time to our memory and they will help differentiate\nvery similar memories, like: how do you find your bike that you park at the station\nevery day in the same area, but in a slightly different position? And more interesting\nto my colleague Robert is the research we have been doing\non neurogenesis and depression. So in an animal model of depression, we have seen that we have\na lower level of neurogenesis. And if we give antidepressants, then we increase the production\nof these newborn neurons, and we decrease\nthe symptoms of depression, establishing a clear link\nbetween neurogenesis and depression. But moreover, if you\njust block neurogenesis, then you block the efficacy\nof the antidepressant. So by then, Robert had understood that very likely his patients\nwere suffering from depression even after being cured of their cancer, because the cancer drug had stopped\nnewborn neurons from being generated. And it will take time\nto generate new neurons that reach normal functions. So, collectively, now we think\nwe have enough evidence to say that neurogenesis\nis a target of choice if we want to improve\nmemory formation or mood, or even prevent the decline\nassociated with aging, or associated with stress. So the next question is: can we control neurogenesis? The answer is yes. And we are now going to do a little quiz. I'm going to give you a set\nof behaviors and activities, and you tell me if you think\nthey will increase neurogenesis or if they will decrease neurogenesis. Are we ready? OK, let's go. So what about learning? Increasing? Yes. Learning will increase the production\nof these new neurons. How about stress? Yes, stress will decrease the production\nof new neurons in the hippocampus. How about sleep deprivation? Indeed, it will decrease neurogenesis. How about sex? Oh, wow! (Laughter) Yes, you are right, it will increase\nthe production of new neurons. However, it's all about balance here. We don't want to fall in a situation -- (Laughter) about too much sex\nleading to sleep deprivation. (Laughter) How about getting older? So the neurogenesis rate\nwill decrease as we get older, but it is still occurring. And then finally, how about running? I will let you judge that one by yourself. So this is one of the first studies that was carried out by one of my mentors,\nRusty Gage from the Salk Institute, showing that the environment\ncan have an impact on the production of new neurons. And here you see a section\nof the hippocampus of a mouse that had no running wheel in its cage. And the little black dots you see\nare actually newborn neurons-to-be. And now, you see a section\nof the hippocampus of a mouse that had a running wheel in its cage. So you see the massive increase of the black dots representing\nthe new neurons-to-be. So activity impacts neurogenesis,\nbut that's not all. What you eat will have an effect on the production of new neurons\nin the hippocampus. So here we have a sample of diet -- of nutrients that have been shown\nto have efficacy. And I'm just going\nto point a few out to you: Calorie restriction of 20 to 30 percent\nwill increase neurogenesis. Intermittent fasting --\nspacing the time between your meals -- will increase neurogenesis. Intake of flavonoids, which are contained\nin dark chocolate or blueberries, will increase neurogenesis. Omega-3 fatty acids, present in fatty fish, like salmon, will increase the production\nof these new neurons. Conversely, a diet rich\nin high saturated fat will have a negative impact\non neurogenesis. Ethanol -- intake of alcohol --\nwill decrease neurogenesis. However, not everything is lost; resveratrol, which is\ncontained in red wine, has been shown to promote\nthe survival of these new neurons. So next time you are at a dinner party, you might want to reach for this possibly\n\"neurogenesis-neutral\" drink. (Laughter) And then finally,\nlet me point out the last one -- a quirky one. So Japanese groups are fascinated\nwith food textures, and they have shown that actually\nsoft diet impairs neurogenesis, as opposed to food that requires\nmastication -- chewing -- or crunchy food. So all of this data, where we need to look\nat the cellular level, has been generated using animal models. But this diet has also been given\nto human participants, and what we could see is that\nthe diet modulates memory and mood in the same direction\nas it modulates neurogenesis, such as: calorie restriction\nwill improve memory capacity, whereas a high-fat diet will exacerbate\nsymptoms of depression -- as opposed to omega-3 fatty acids,\nwhich increase neurogenesis, and also help to decrease\nthe symptoms of depression. So we think that the effect of diet on mental health, on memory and mood, is actually mediated by the production\nof the new neurons in the hippocampus. And it's not only what you eat, but it's also the texture\nof the food, when you eat it and how much of it you eat. On our side -- neuroscientists\ninterested in neurogenesis -- we need to understand better\nthe function of these new neurons, and how we can control their survival\nand their production. We also need to find a way to protect\nthe neurogenesis of Robert's patients. And on your side -- I leave you in charge\nof your neurogenesis. Thank you. (Applause) Margaret Heffernan:\nFantastic research, Sandrine. Now, I told you you changed my life -- I now eat a lot of blueberries. Sandrine Thuret: Very good. MH: I'm really interested\nin the running thing. Do I have to run? Or is it really just\nabout aerobic exercise, getting oxygen to the brain? Could it be any kind of vigorous exercise? ST: So for the moment, we can't really say\nif it's just the running itself, but we think that anything that indeed\nwill increase the production -- or moving the blood flow to the brain, should be beneficial. MH: So I don't have to get\na running wheel in my office? ST: No, you don't! MH: Oh, what a relief! That's wonderful. Sandrine Thuret, thank you so much. ST: Thank you, Margaret.

The scientific explanation for this is that it’s the result of\nmolten lava contracting and fracturing as it cooled in the wake \nof a volcanic eruption. But an ancient Irish myth \nhas a different accounting. According to legend, the giant Finn MacCool lived happily \non the North Antrim coast with his wife Oonagh. Their only disturbance came from\nthe taunts and threats of the giant Benandonner, or the red man, \nwho lived across the sea in Scotland. The two roared insults \nand hurled rocks at each other in dramatic shows of strength. Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land \nand heaved it at his rival, but it fell short of reaching land. Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man, and the crater left from the disturbed\nearth filled with water to become Lough Neagh. The giants’ tough talk continued, until one day Benandonner challenged \nFinn to a fight, face to face. And so the Irish giant tossed \nenough boulders into the sea to create a bridge of stepping \nstones to the Scottish coast. Finn marched across in a fit of rage. When Scotland loomed before him, he made out the figure \nof Benandonner from afar. Finn was a substantial size, but at the sight of his colossal\nenemy thundering towards him, his courage faltered. With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck\nand crushing fists, Finn turned and ran. Back home, with Benandonner \nfast approaching, Finn trembled as he described \nhis enemy’s bulk to Oonagh. They knew that if he faced \nBenandonner head on, he’d be crushed. And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan - they needed to create an illusion of size, to suggest Finn was a mountain \nof a man whilst keeping him out of sight. As Benandonner neared \nthe end of the bridge, Oonagh stuffed her husband \nin a huge cradle. Disguised as an enormous baby, Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner \npounded on the door. The house shook as he stepped inside. Oonagh told the enraged visitor \nthat her husband wasn’t home, but welcomed him to sit\nand eat while he waited. When Benandonner tore into the cakes \nplaced before him, he cried out in pain for he’d shattered his teeth \non the metal Oonagh had concealed inside. She told him that this \nwas Finn’s favorite bread, sowing a seed of doubt \nin Benandonner’s mind that he was any match for his rival. When Finn let out a squawk, Benandonner’s attention was drawn \nto the gigantic baby in the corner. So hefty was the infant swaddled \nunder piles of blankets, Benandonner shuddered at the thought \nof what the father would look like. He decided he’d rather not find out. As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks \nconnecting the shores, breaking up the causeway. What remains are two identical \nrock formations: one on the North Antrim coast of Ireland and one at Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, \nright across the sea."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Giant’s Causeway consists of which type of rock?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Granite"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Basalt"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Marble"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Quartz"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Legend says that Finn MacCool is responsible for the formation of ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lough Derg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lough Neagh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Giant’s Causeway"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The River Shannon"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Lough Neagh and the Giant's Causeway"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "\"Benandonner\" means ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The red man"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The selfish giant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The giant across the sea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The big man"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Oonagh disguised her husband as ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A rock formation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A giant baby"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A huge dog"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A piece of land"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Across the sea from the Giant’s Causeway, an identical rock formation occurs at ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lough Ness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Glasgow Causeway"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fingal’s Cave"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Benandonner’s Lair"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 26, "lesson": 4, "title": "What should you listen to when you want to focus?", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/IyoBPrLA", "transcript": {"en": "As a writer, comedian, researcher, and DJ,\nI have to have music to focus. But I have friends who need *complete silence*\nto study, write, or be productive. So which one’s better for our brain and our body? Let’s start by finding out what noise, the\nopposite of silence, does to our bodies. Studies were conducted by the World Health\nOrganization that linked noise pollution, like loud city sounds, with higher blood pressure\nand a higher chance for a fatal heart attack. All right, don’t panic, that neighbor playing\nMigos at 4 a.m. isn’t going to kill you, but prolonged exposure to a noisy environment\ncan lead to cognitive deficits as well. Studies have shown that students in schools\nnear airports and train stations have suffered negative effects on long-term memory and reading\ncomprehension, leading some cities to require soundproofing in schools. \nSo, noise may not kill you, but it increases your stress levels, \nwhich is no bueno for your brain long-term. Are you hearing this, construction workers\nwho have to fix my sidewalk at 6 a.m.? Yeah, I'm comin' for y'all. Silence, on the other hand, has been correlated\nwith lower stress hormones. Also, studies done on mice in 2013 found that\nthose exposed to silence over white noise, or even Mozart, expressed higher rates of\nneurogenesis, or the production of neurons, in the hippocampus, the part of the brain\nthat processes memory. Further studies found more evidence that the\nbrain is processing and evaluating new information faster in times of silence over sound. So, less stress, new neurons, new synaptic\nconnections and memory formation? Sounds good for productivity. I know what you’re thinking: “but I do\nmy best work when listening to Evanescence!” Me too. I love \"Bring Me To Life.\" But be patient, we’re getting there! Music permeates all parts of the brain; not\njust the temporal lobe or the auditory cortices. If the song slaps (or if it’s trash), it’ll\nactivate your amygdala and parts of your limbic system \nresponsible for emotional response. What’s more, both music and language are\nauditorily processed; both are forms of communication, and I don’t know about y’all, but I consider\nmusic like a language. I mean, have you SEEN sheet music? \nThat's from a different alien race. New research shows that there may be neurons\nin the auditory cortex that activate specifically for music; \nnot language, or other random sounds. So, if your brain is busy processing emotions,\nlyrics, and now there’s these new other neurons firing, how much attention is left\nto remember SOH CAH TOA? Remember that gem from seventh grade algebra? ...I'm old. Science says...it depends. A 2010 study found that music may impair cognitive\nabilities if you’re trying to memorize a specific order; it could be thrown off by\na key change, a lyrical choice, or Drake getting you deep down in your feelings. Even if you’re not distracted, a 2006 study\nmeasured the effects of tempo on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Slow, meditative music can get us to relax,\nslowing both your heart rate and breathing but this study found that we’re the most\nrelaxed when there’s a wait for it... ...pause. See what I did there? So, silence wins? Well, if your goal is complete zen relaxation\nwhile you write that final, then, yeah, try silence. But again, this all depends on a lot of variables:\nlyrics, tempo, and genre have all been shown to have various effects on focus, mood, and\nproductivity. But if you have to listen to that Randy Newman\nto get those reports in, more power to you. If you have a work or study playlist,\ngo for it! Verdict: do you! If you’ll excuse me, I have to go listen\nto some Celine Dion, because I love Titanic. ♩ Near, far, where--- later, later. Yo, what's good -- thanks for watching Seeker. Be sure to subscribe.

Your team of secret agents has tracked him \nto his underground lab. You burst in to find… that it’s a trap! Dr. Schrödinger has slipped \ninto the next room to activate his device and disabled the control\npanel on the way out. Fortunately, your teammates are \nmasters of spy-craft. Agent Delta has hacked \ninto the control panel and managed to reactivate \nsome of its functionality. Meanwhile, Agent Epsilon has\nsearched through surveillance to find the code for the door: 2, 10, 14. All you have to do is enter those numbers \nand you’ll be free. But there’s a problem. The control panel has only three buttons: one which adds 5 to the display number, one which adds 7, and one which takes the square root. You need to make the display output\nthe numbers 2, 10, and 14, \nin that order. It’s okay if it outputs different \nnumbers in between, but there’s no way to reset the display, so once you get to 2, you’ll have to continue \non to 10 and 14 from there. Not only that, Agent Delta explains that there are other traps \nbuilt into the panel. If it ever shows the same number \nmore than once, a number greater than 60, or a non-whole number, the room will explode. Right now, the display reads zero, \nand time is running out. There’s only one way to solve the puzzle,\nwith a few small variations. How will you input the code to escape \nfrom Dr. Schrödinger’s lair and save the day? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 2 1. You look over your options. Adding 5 or 7 increases the number, and the square root button \nwill make it smaller. But there are only a few options \nwhere you can use that button: 4 9 16 25, 36, and 49. You’d love to make 4 or 16. Then you could hit the square root button \nonce or twice to get 2. But you can’t make either with \njust the 5 and 7 buttons. What will you do? You look at the other possible options for\nnumbers you could take the square root of. Nine you can’t reach. Twenty-five and 49 would take you back to \n5 or 7, and you can already get to each\nof those. Thirty-six is your only option. You add 5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 7, and then hit the square root button. Why that series of 5s and 7s? It’s somewhat arbitrary, but you know that you want \nto avoid 10, 14, and perfect squares, since you’ll need them later. This gets you to 6. Does that help? Looking at your options,\nyou see that 16 is now in your sights. You add 5 twice more to reach it. Then hit square root twice. That gets you to 2. You’re on your way! Now to 10. You can’t get straight \nthere through addition alone, so you’re going to have \nto reach another square. Taking the square root of 9 or 25 would \nget you to a good place, but it turns out that 25 \nis unreachable from 2. So you add 7 to get to 9, then take the square root again. That gets you to 3. Adding 7 again makes 10. Finally, you need to reach 14. Thinking backwards, you imagine where \nyou could be before 14: 7 or 9. But 9 won’t work because \nyou’ve already used 9. However, you could get to 7 \nby reaching 49 first. You add your way towards it, being careful not to hit any \nof the numbers you’ve hit so far. You thread your way carefully, adding five 5s and two 7s. Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more. The door opens, \nand you’re out of the trap.

{"page": 26, "lesson": 6, "title": "The brain-changing benefits of exercise - Wendy Suzuki", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/X93aZK9s", "transcript": {"en": "What if I told you there was something\nthat you can do right now that would have an immediate,\npositive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing\ncould actually last a long time and protect your brain\nfrom different conditions like depression,\nAlzheimer's disease or dementia. Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects\nof physical activity. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting\nand protective benefits for your brain. And that can last\nfor the rest of your life. So what I want to do today\nis tell you a story about how I used my deep\nunderstanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered\nthe science underlying why exercise\nis the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Now, as a neuroscientist,\nI know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure\nknown to humankind. But it's one thing\nto talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. So here is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas\nthat we are going to talk about today. The first is the prefrontal cortex,\nright behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making,\nfocus, attention and your personality. The second key area is located\nin the temporal lobe, shown right here. You have two temporal lobes in your brain,\nthe right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe\nis a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term\nmemories for facts and events. And that structure\nis called the hippocampus. So I've always been fascinated\nwith the hippocampus. How could it be that an event\nthat lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory\nthat has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand. I wanted to start and record\nthe activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. And essentially try and decode how\nthose brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons\ncommunicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us\nto form a new memory, or did not. But a few years ago,\nI did something very unusual in science. As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch\nmy research program. Because I encountered something\nthat was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. I discovered and I experienced\nthe brain-changing effects of exercise. And I did it in a completely\ninadvertent way. I was actually at the height\nof all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field\nfor all of this memory work. And it should have been going great.\nIt was, scientifically. But when I stuck my head\nout of my lab door, I noticed something. I had no social life. I spent too much time\nlistening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds. And actually, it took me\nmany years to realize it, I was actually miserable. And I shouldn't be miserable. And I went on a river-rafting trip --\nby myself, because I had no social life. And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, \"Oh, my God,\nI was the weakest person on that trip.\" And I came back with a mission. I said, \"I'm never going to feel\nlike the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again.\" And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise\nclasses at the gym. I tried everything. I went to kickbox,\ndance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. But what I noticed is that after every\nsweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost\nand this great energy boost. And that's what kept me\ngoing back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling better,\nI even lost that 25 pounds. And now, fast-forward a year and a half\ninto this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really\nmade me sit up and take notice. I was sitting at my desk,\nwriting a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone\nthrough my mind before. And that thought was, \"Gee, grant-writing is going well today.\" And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists\nalways laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always\npulling your hair out, trying to come up with that\nmillion-dollar-winning idea. But I realized that\nthe grant-writing was going well, because I was able\nto focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. And my long-term memory --\nwhat I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. And that's when I put it together. Maybe all that exercise\nthat I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. Maybe I did an experiment on myself\nwithout even knowing it. So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see\nwhat I could find about what we knew about the effects\nof exercise on the brain. And what I found was an exciting\nand a growing literature that was essentially showing everything\nthat I noticed in myself. Better mood, better energy,\nbetter memory, better attention. And the more I learned, the more I realized\nhow powerful exercise was. Which eventually\nled me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. And so now, after several years\nof really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is\nthe most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. Number one: it has\nimmediate effects on your brain. A single workout that you do will immediately increase\nlevels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin\nand noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood\nright after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability\nto shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement\nwill last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout\nwill improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster\nat catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient,\nthey help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime,\nincrease your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually\nchanges the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. Let's start with my favorite\nbrain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus -- or exercise actually\nproduces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus,\nthat actually increase its volume, as well as improve\nyour long-term memory, OK? And that including in you and me. Number two: the most common finding\nin neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function\ndependent on your prefrontal cortex. You not only get\nbetter focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus\nincreases as well. And finally, you not only get\nimmediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. So you get long-lasting increases\nin those good mood neurotransmitters. But really, the most transformative thing\nthat exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. Here you can think\nabout the brain like a muscle. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus\nand prefrontal cortex gets. Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex\nand the hippocampus are the two areas that are most\nsusceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. So with increased exercise\nover your lifetime, you're not going to cure\ndementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do\nis you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus\nand prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases\nto actually have an effect. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free. So this is the point in the talk\nwhere everybody says, \"That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only\nwant to know one thing. And that is, just tell me\nthe minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes.\" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you\nthe answer to that question. First, good news: you don't have to become\na triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get\nthree to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. That is, get your heart rate up. And the good news is,\nyou don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra walk around the block\nin your power walk. You see stairs -- take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good\nas the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. From going into the innermost\nworkings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise\ncan improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb\nthat I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. I want to understand\nthe optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age,\nat your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain\nand protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise,\nand it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power\nas a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. (Laughter) We're going to do\njust one minute of exercise. It's call-and-response,\njust do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch\nyour neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight,\nit's right, left, right, left. And I say, I am strong now. Let's hear you. Audience: I am strong now. Wendy Suzuki: Ladies,\nI am Wonder Woman-strong. Let's hear you! Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. I am inspired now. You say it! Audience: I am inspired now. WS: Last move -- pull it down,\nright and left, right and left. I say, I am on fire now! You say it. Audience: I am on fire now. WS: And done! OK, good job! (Applause) Thank you. I want to leave you with one last thought. And that is, bringing\nexercise in your life will not only give you\na happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain\nfrom incurable diseases. And in this way it will change\nthe trajectory of your life for the better. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Everyone said the path\nto happiness was success, so I searched for that ideal job, that perfect boyfriend,\nthat beautiful apartment. But instead of ever feeling fulfilled, I felt anxious and adrift. And I wasn't alone; my friends --\nthey struggled with this, too. Eventually, I decided to go\nto graduate school for positive psychology to learn what truly makes people happy. But what I discovered there\nchanged my life. The data showed that chasing happiness\ncan make people unhappy. And what really struck me was this: the suicide rate has been rising\naround the world, and it recently reached\na 30-year high in America. Even though life is getting\nobjectively better by nearly every conceivable standard, more people feel hopeless, depressed and alone. There's an emptiness\ngnawing away at people, and you don't have to be\nclinically depressed to feel it. Sooner or later, I think we all wonder: Is this all there is? And according to the research,\nwhat predicts this despair is not a lack of happiness. It's a lack of something else, a lack of having meaning in life. But that raised some questions for me. Is there more to life than being happy? And what's the difference\nbetween being happy and having meaning in life? Many psychologists define happiness\nas a state of comfort and ease, feeling good in the moment. Meaning, though, is deeper. The renowned psychologist\nMartin Seligman says meaning comes from belonging to\nand serving something beyond yourself and from developing the best within you. Our culture is obsessed with happiness, but I came to see that seeking meaning\nis the more fulfilling path. And the studies show that people\nwho have meaning in life, they're more resilient, they do better in school and at work, and they even live longer. So this all made me wonder: How can we each live more meaningfully? To find out, I spent five years\ninterviewing hundreds of people and reading through thousands\nof pages of psychology, neuroscience and philosophy. Bringing it all together, I found that there are what I call\nfour pillars of a meaningful life. And we can each create lives of meaning by building some or all\nof these pillars in our lives. The first pillar is belonging. Belonging comes\nfrom being in relationships where you're valued\nfor who you are intrinsically and where you value others as well. But some groups and relationships\ndeliver a cheap form of belonging; you're valued for what you believe, for who you hate, not for who you are. True belonging springs from love. It lives in moments among individuals, and it's a choice -- you can choose\nto cultivate belonging with others. Here's an example. Each morning, my friend Jonathan\nbuys a newspaper from the same street vendor in New York. They don't just conduct\na transaction, though. They take a moment to slow down, talk, and treat each other like humans. But one time, Jonathan\ndidn't have the right change, and the vendor said, \"Don't worry about it.\" But Jonathan insisted on paying, so he went to the store\nand bought something he didn't need to make change. But when he gave the money to the vendor, the vendor drew back. He was hurt. He was trying to do something kind, but Jonathan had rejected him. I think we all reject people in small ways\nlike this without realizing it. I do. I'll walk by someone I know\nand barely acknowledge them. I'll check my phone\nwhen someone's talking to me. These acts devalue others. They make them feel\ninvisible and unworthy. But when you lead with love,\nyou create a bond that lifts each of you up. For many people, belonging\nis the most essential source of meaning, those bonds to family and friends. For others, the key to meaning\nis the second pillar: purpose. Now, finding your purpose\nis not the same thing as finding that job that makes you happy. Purpose is less about what you want\nthan about what you give. A hospital custodian told me\nher purpose is healing sick people. Many parents tell me, \"My purpose is raising my children.\" The key to purpose\nis using your strengths to serve others. Of course, for many of us,\nthat happens through work. That's how we contribute and feel needed. But that also means\nthat issues like disengagement at work, unemployment, low labor force participation -- these aren't just economic problems,\nthey're existential ones, too. Without something worthwhile to do, people flounder. Of course, you don't have to find\npurpose at work, but purpose gives you\nsomething to live for, some \"why\" that drives you forward. The third pillar of meaning\nis also about stepping beyond yourself, but in a completely different way: transcendence. Transcendent states are those rare moments when you're lifted above\nthe hustle and bustle of daily life, your sense of self fades away, and you feel connected\nto a higher reality. For one person I talked to,\ntranscendence came from seeing art. For another person, it was at church. For me, I'm a writer,\nand it happens through writing. Sometimes I get so in the zone\nthat I lose all sense of time and place. These transcendent\nexperiences can change you. One study had students look up\nat 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees for one minute. But afterwards\nthey felt less self-centered, and they even behaved more generously when given the chance to help someone. Belonging, purpose, transcendence. Now, the fourth pillar\nof meaning, I've found, tends to surprise people. The fourth pillar is storytelling, the story you tell yourself\nabout yourself. Creating a narrative from the events\nof your life brings clarity. It helps you understand\nhow you became you. But we don't always realize\nthat we're the authors of our stories and can change the way we're telling them. Your life isn't just a list of events. You can edit, interpret\nand retell your story, even as you're constrained by the facts. I met a young man named Emeka,\nwho'd been paralyzed playing football. After his injury, Emeka told himself, \"My life was great playing football, but now look at me.\" People who tell stories like this -- \"My life was good. Now it's bad.\" -- tend to be more anxious and depressed. And that was Emeka for a while. But with time, he started\nto weave a different story. His new story was, \"Before my injury,\nmy life was purposeless. I partied a lot and was\na pretty selfish guy. But my injury made me realize\nI could be a better man.\" That edit to his story\nchanged Emeka's life. After telling the new story to himself, Emeka started mentoring kids, and he discovered what his purpose was: serving others. The psychologist Dan McAdams\ncalls this a \"redemptive story,\" where the bad is redeemed by the good. People leading meaningful\nlives, he's found, tend to tell stories about their lives defined by redemption, growth and love. But what makes people\nchange their stories? Some people get help from a therapist, but you can do it on your own, too, just by reflecting\non your life thoughtfully, how your defining experiences shaped you, what you lost, what you gained. That's what Emeka did. You won't change your story overnight; it could take years and be painful. After all, we've all suffered,\nand we all struggle. But embracing those painful memories\ncan lead to new insights and wisdom, to finding that good that sustains you. Belonging, purpose,\ntranscendence, storytelling: those are the four pillars of meaning. When I was younger, I was lucky enough to be surrounded\nby all of the pillars. My parents ran a Sufi meetinghouse\nfrom our home in Montreal. Sufism is a spiritual practice\nassociated with the whirling dervishes and the poet Rumi. Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home to meditate, drink Persian tea,\nand share stories. Their practice also involved\nserving all of creation through small acts of love, which meant being kind\neven when people wronged you. But it gave them a purpose:\nto rein in the ego. Eventually, I left home for college and without the daily grounding\nof Sufism in my life, I felt unmoored. And I started searching for those things\nthat make life worth living. That's what set me on this journey. Looking back, I now realize that the Sufi house\nhad a real culture of meaning. The pillars were part of the architecture, and the presence of the pillars\nhelped us all live more deeply. Of course, the same principle applies in other strong communities as well -- good ones and bad ones. Gangs, cults: these are cultures of meaning\nthat use the pillars and give people\nsomething to live and die for. But that's exactly why we as a society must offer better alternatives. We need to build these pillars\nwithin our families and our institutions to help people become their best selves. But living a meaningful life takes work. It's an ongoing process. As each day goes by,\nwe're constantly creating our lives, adding to our story. And sometimes we can get off track. Whenever that happens to me, I remember a powerful experience\nI had with my father. Several months after\nI graduated from college, my dad had a massive heart attack\nthat should have killed him. He survived, and when I asked him\nwhat was going through his mind as he faced death, he said all he could think about\nwas needing to live so he could be there\nfor my brother and me, and this gave him the will\nto fight for life. When he went under anesthesia\nfor emergency surgery, instead of counting backwards from 10, he repeated our names like a mantra. He wanted our names to be\nthe last words he spoke on earth if he died. My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi. It's a humble life, but a good life. Lying there facing death,\nhe had a reason to live: love. His sense of belonging within his family, his purpose as a dad, his transcendent meditation,\nrepeating our names -- these, he says, are the reasons\nwhy he survived. That's the story he tells himself. That's the power of meaning. Happiness comes and goes. But when life is really good and when things are really bad, having meaning gives you\nsomething to hold on to. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 26, "lesson": 8, "title": "Lessons from the longest study on human development - Helen Pearson", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/8GLfyG1X", "transcript": {"en": "Today I want to confess something to you, but first of all I'm going to ask you\na couple of questions. How many people here have children? And how many of you are confident that you know how\nto bring up your children in exactly the right way? (Laughter) OK, I don't see too many hands\ngoing up on that second one, and that's my confession, too. I've got three boys; they're three, nine and 12. And like you, and like most parents, the honest truth is I have\npretty much no idea what I'm doing. I want them to be\nhappy and healthy in their lives, but I don't know what I'm supposed to do to make sure they are happy and healthy. There's so many books\noffering all kinds of conflicting advice, it can be really overwhelming. So I've spent most of their lives\njust making it up as I go along. However, something changed me\na few years ago, when I came across a little secret\nthat we have in Britain. It's helped me become more confident\nabout how I bring up my own children, and it's revealed a lot about\nhow we as a society can help all children. I want to share that secret\nwith you today. For the last 70 years, scientists in Britain have been following\nthousands of children through their lives as part of an incredible scientific study. There's nothing quite like it\nanywhere else in the world. Collecting information\non thousands of children is a really powerful thing to do, because it means we can compare\nthe ones who say, do well at school or end up healthy\nor happy or wealthy as adults, and the ones who struggle much more, and then we can sift through\nall the information we've collected and try to work out why\ntheir lives turned out different. This British study --\nit's actually a kind of crazy story. So it all starts back in 1946, just a few months\nafter the end of the war, when scientists wanted to know what it was like for a woman\nto have a baby at the time. They carried out\nthis huge survey of mothers and ended up recording the birth\nof nearly every baby born in England, Scotland\nand Wales in one week. That was nearly 14,000 babies. The questions they asked these women are very different than the ones\nwe might ask today. They sound really old-fashioned now. They asked them things like, \"During pregnancy, did you get your full extra ration\nof a pint of milk a day?\" \"How much did you spend\non smocks, corsets, nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?\" And this is my favorite one: \"Who looked after your husband\nwhile you were in bed with this baby?\" (Laughter) Now, this wartime study\nactually ended up being so successful that scientists did it again. They recorded the births\nof thousands of babies born in 1958 and thousands more in 1970. They did it again in the early 1990s, and again at the turn of the millennium. Altogether, more than 70,000 children\nhave been involved in these studies across those five generations. They're called the British birth cohorts, and scientists have gone back\nand recorded more information on all of these people\nevery few years ever since. The amount of information\nthat's now been collected on these people is just completely mind-boggling. It includes thousands\nof paper questionnaires and terabytes' worth of computer data. Scientists have also built up\na huge bank of tissue samples, which includes locks of hair,\nnail clippings, baby teeth and DNA. They've even collected 9,000 placentas\nfrom some of the births, which are now pickled in plastic buckets\nin a secure storage warehouse. This whole project has become unique -- so, no other country in the world\nis tracking generations of children in quite this detail. These are some of the best-studied\npeople on the planet, and the data has become\nincredibly valuable for scientists, generating well over 6,000\nacademic papers and books. But today I want to focus\non just one finding -- perhaps the most important discovery\nto come from this remarkable study. And it's also the one\nthat spoke to me personally, because it's about how to use science\nto do the best for our children. So, let's get the bad news\nout of the way first. Perhaps the biggest message\nfrom this remarkable study is this: don't be born into poverty\nor into disadvantage, because if you are, you're far more likely\nto walk a difficult path in life. Many children in this study\nwere born into poor families or into working-class families that had\ncramped homes or other problems, and it's clear now\nthat those disadvantaged children have been more likely to struggle\non almost every score. They've been more likely\nto do worse at school, to end up with worse jobs\nand to earn less money. Now, maybe that sounds really obvious, but some of the results\nhave been really surprising, so children who had a tough start in life are also more likely to end up\nunhealthy as adults. They're more likely to be overweight, to have high blood pressure, and then decades down the line, more likely to have a failing memory,\npoor health and even to die earlier. Now, I talked about what happens later, but some of these differences emerge\nat a really shockingly early age. In one study, children who were growing up in poverty were almost a year behind\nthe richer children on educational tests, and that was by the age of just three. These types of differences have been found\nagain and again across the generations. It means that our early circumstances\nhave a profound influence on the way that the rest\nof our lives play out. And working out why that is is one of the most difficult questions\nthat we face today. So there we have it. The first lesson for successful life,\neveryone, is this: choose your parents very carefully. (Laughter) Don't be born into a poor family\nor into a struggling family. Now, I'm sure you can see\nthe small problem here. We can't choose our parents\nor how much they earn, but this British study has also struck\na real note of optimism by showing that not everyone\nwho has a disadvantaged start ends up in difficult circumstances. As you know, many people\nhave a tough start in life, but they end up doing very well\non some measure nevertheless, and this study starts to explain how. So the second lesson is this: parents really matter. In this study, children who had engaged,\ninterested parents, ones who had ambition for their future, were more likely to escape\nfrom a difficult start. It seems that parents and what they do\nare really, really important, especially in the first few years of life. Let me give you an example of that. In one study, scientists looked at about 17,000 children\nwho were born in 1970. They sifted all the mountains of data\nthat they had collected to try to work out what allowed the children\nwho'd had a difficult start in life to go on and do well\nat school nevertheless. In other words, which ones beat the odds. The data showed that what mattered\nmore than anything else was parents. Having engaged, interested parents\nin those first few years of life was strongly linked to children going on\nto do well at school later on. In fact, quite small things\nthat parents do are associated with good\noutcomes for children. Talking and listening to a child, responding to them warmly, teaching them their letters and numbers, taking them on trips and visits. Reading to children every day\nseems to be really important, too. So in one study, children whose parents were reading\nto them daily when they were five and then showing an interest\nin their education at the age of 10, were significantly less likely\nto be in poverty at the age of 30 than those whose parents\nweren't doing those things. Now, there are huge challenges\nwith interpreting this type of science. These studies show\nthat certain things that parents do are correlated with good\noutcomes for children, but we don't necessarily know\nthose behaviors caused the good outcomes, or whether some other factor\nis getting in the way. For example, we have to take\ngenes into account, and that's a whole other talk in itself. But scientists working\nwith this British study are working really hard to get at causes, and this is one study I particularly love. In this one, they looked at the bedtime routines\nof about 10,000 children born at the turn of the millennium. Were the children going to bed\nat regular times, or did they go to bed\nat different times during the week? The data showed that those children\nwho were going to bed at different times were more likely\nto have behavioral problems, and then those that switched\nto having regular bedtimes often showed an improvement in behavior, and that was really crucial, because it suggested\nit was the bedtime routines that were really helping things\nget better for those kids. Here's another one to think about. In this one, scientists looked at children\nwho were reading for pleasure. That means that they picked up\na magazine, a picture book, a story book. The data showed that children\nwho were reading for pleasure at the ages of five and 10 were more likely to go on in school\nbetter, on average, on school tests later in their lives. And not just tests of reading, but tests of spelling and maths as well. This study tried to control\nfor all the confounding factors, so it looked at children\nwho were equally intelligent and from the same social-class background, so it seemed as if it was the reading\nwhich really helped those children go on and score better on those\nschool tests later in their lives. Now at the start, I said the first lesson from this study was not to be born into poverty\nor into disadvantage, because those children tend to follow\nmore difficult paths in their lives. But then I said that parenting matters, and that good parenting,\nif you can call it that, helps children beat the odds and overcome some\nof those early disadvantages. So wait, does that actually mean, then,\nthat poverty doesn't matter after all? You could argue it doesn't matter\nif a child is born poor -- as long as their parents are good parents,\nthey're going to do just fine. I don't believe that's true. This study shows that poverty\nand parenting matter. And one study actually\nput figures on that, so it looked at children\ngrowing up in persistent poverty and how well they were doing at school. The data showed that even when their parents\nwere doing everything right -- putting them to bed on time and reading to them every day\nand everything else -- that only got those children so far. Good parenting only reduced\nthe educational gap between the rich and poor children\nby about 50 percent. Now that means that poverty\nleaves a really lasting scar, and it means that if we really want\nto ensure the success and well-being of the next generation, then tackling child poverty\nis an incredibly important thing to do. Now, what does all this mean\nfor you and me? Are there lessons here\nwe can all take home and use? As a scientist and a journalist, I like to have some science\nto inform my parenting ... and I can tell you that when\nyou're shouting at your kids to go to bed on time, it really helps to have\nthe scientific literature on your side. (Laughter) And wouldn't it be great to think that all we had to do to have\nhappy, successful children was to talk to them,\nbe interested in their future, put them to bed on time,\nand give them a book to read? Our job would be done. Now, as you can imagine, the answers aren't quite\nas simple as that. For one thing, this study\nlooks at what happens to thousands and thousands\nof children on average, but that doesn't necessarily say\nwhat will help my child or your child or any individual child. In the end, each of our children\nis going to walk their own path, and that's partly defined\nby the genes they inherit and of course all the experiences\nthey have through their lives, including their interactions\nwith us, their parents. I will tell you what I did\nafter I learned all this. It's a bit embarrassing. I realized I was so busy working, and ironically, learning and writing about this incredible\nstudy of British children, that there were days when I hardly\neven spoke to my own British children. So at home, we introduced talking time, which is just 15 minutes\nat the end of the day when we talk and listen to the boys. I try better now to ask them\nwhat they did today, and to show that I value\nwhat they do at school. Of course, I make sure\nthey always have a book to read. I tell them I'm ambitious\nfor their future, and I think they can be happy\nand do great things. I don't know that any of that\nwill make a difference, but I'm pretty confident\nit won't do them any harm, and it might even do them some good. Ultimately, if we want happy children, all we can do is listen to the science, and of course, listen to our children themselves. Thank you."}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 26, "lesson": 9, "title": "Private school vs public school - how do the students compare?", "category": "Teaching & Education", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/CTSTSs9V", "transcript": {"en": "Do you think you got the best start in life? Did you end-up in a school that might have\nresembled a zoo more than it felt like an institution of higher learning? Perhaps in the past, getting by without a\nlot of pieces of paper to defend your intelligence may have been harder, given that nowadays\nwe can learn so much online and that many of the world’s leading and richest entrepreneurs\ndropped out of university. Had they have dropped out of high school,\nthat could have been a different matter, but many great minds have not been too keen on\nschool. One of those minds was Albert Einstein, who\nfamously said, “Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned\nin school.” So does it matter where you go? That’s what we’ll find out today, in this\nepisode of the Infographics Show, Private School vs. Public School. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the\nbell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. First of all, we should say that by “public\nschool” we mean schools that are run by the government. This could be confusing for Brits as when\nthey say public school, they are not thinking of schools run by the public sector, but selective\ninstitutions that demand private payment. Basically, private school as Americans know\nit, is public school in the UK. It’s another case of that “my tom-ate-o”\nand your “tom-art-o”. We’ll base this show on the U.S. today,\nas covering the globe’s schools would be impossible, and some of the things we will\ndiscuss are relevant globally. You might be surprised to know that in the\nUSA, according to the Council for American Private Education, there are 33,619 private\nschools in the United States. There are around 5.1 million students enrolled\nin these schools. It’s said that private schools are home\nto almost 10 percent of all school students in the U.S. The same source states that there are 441,496\nteachers working full-time in private schools. As much as 79 percent of these schools have\na religious affiliation. The Washington Post reported in 2016 that\nthese schools are “virtually all-white”, with non-white students only making up around\n10 percent of students across the country. As for public schools, according to the National\nCenter for Educational Statistics, 50.7 million public school students will be studying in\none of them from prekindergarten to grade 12 in fall 2017. Teaching all those kids will be 3.2 million\nfull-time teachers, which is a ratio of 16 students for every teacher. The ratio in private school is 12 students\nfor one teacher. One of the main differences of public school\nis the mixed ethnicity of students. Public schools in America are made up of 24.4\nmillion white kids, 13.6 million Hispanic students, 8.0 million black students, 2.8\nmillion Asian/Pacific Islander students, 0.5 million American Indian/Alaska Native students,\nand 1.5 million mixed race students. What about costs? Well, the government pays for public schools. In 2017-18 it’s projected that the budget\nfor public schools will be $623.5 billion. This means that each student will cost on\naverage $12,300. Taxes will pay for this. Private schools are a different matter, and\nthey are funded by tuition fees. Tuition costs will change depending on the\nschool. For the year 2017-18, the national average\nfor private school tuition is $9,975 per year, which is $8,918 per year for elementary schooling\nand $13,524 per year for high school. The state of Vermont had the highest average,\nwith high school being $31,543 per year on average. If you are looking for cheap private schooling,\nhead to West Virginia where the average cost for high school is currently $5,262. We should add that a handful of private schools\ncost around the $50,000 a year mark. So, what do you get for your money besides\npretty gardens and obviously top-notch facilities at a private school, and perhaps metal detectors\nand patrolling policemen in some wayward public schools? Well, when it comes to the syllabi, public\nschools have to adhere to state standards while private schools have much more flexibility. This is seen as getting a better and more\ndiverse education. The good news for not so wealthy people is\nthat high school graduation rates in public schools has gone up recently. It reached its highest during the Obama administration\nin 2015 at 83.2 percent of students graduating. At the same time, 95 percent of private school\nstudents graduate. According to the website College Admission,\njust about all of those private school grads will attend a university, whereas only 49\npercent of public school graduates will enter further education at college. If you want to get into an Ivy League University,\nthere’s no reason why you can’t get in after attending public school. Top Tier Admissions tells us that roughly\n25 percent of successful applicants to those top universities came from private schools,\nand 60-70 percent from public schools. The rest were homeschooled. Private school does work for a lot of people. The richest man in the world, Bill Gates,\nwent to a private prep school…but then he later dropped out of Harvard. On the other hand, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg\nwent to a public school. When researching for how private school graduates\nout earn other kids in the future, most of the stories are about the UK and how private\n(or public) school there seems to create most of the UK’s millionaires. The U.S. playing field might be a bit more\nlevel, after all, Dr. Dre didn’t go to private school. It seems in the U.S. if you actually get to\nuniversity, it might not matter where you studied in high school in terms of “making\nit”. At the same time, studies have found that\nbeing born with a silver spoon usually means you’ll be passing that spoon on, and poorer\nfolks with degrees don’t usually jump up a class. Your background makes all the difference. A college degree, says one report, is no great\nequalizer. Why is this? “There are a host of possibilities, from\nfamily resources during childhood and the place where one grew up, to the colleges that\nlow-income students attend,” said the report. Then you have rich folks that dropped out\nof high school, such as the billionaire Tumblr founder David Karp, who dropped out of high\nschool at 15 years old. Joining him as a high school dropout is Facebook’s\nformer product manager Mike Hudack and filmmaker Quentin Tarantino. In light of the last person, success in the\narts or sport probably is not related to if you went to public or private school, but\nif you want “social mobility” then it’s probably better your parents paid the cash\nfor your education. It also seems that the filmmaker is the only\none of the three to have come from a humble background. You may have some unique skills, or be a natural\nautodidact (learn by yourself), and so school doesn’t matter much even if you are poor. Nonetheless, we can’t ignore some statistics. The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that\npeople without a high school diploma will earn on average $25,636 per year if in full-time\nemployment. 8 percent of high school dropouts are currently\nunemployed. If you have a high school diploma and nothing\nelse, the average wage is $35,256 per year with 5.4 percent of those people currently\nunemployed. If you have a bachelor’s degree, you might\nearn an average of $59,124 per year. Only 2.8 percent of Americans with a bachelor’s\ndegree are unemployed, much less than the 4.4 percent of Americans currently out of\na job. In conclusion, it’s odds on that if you\nwent to private school then you most certainly went to university, and with some family wealth\nbehind you, it’s also pretty much a certainty you fell into one of these higher wage brackets. Then again, if you are brilliant, or spend\nmore time reading than scrolling, then it is likely nothing will hold you back. So, what do you think...is private school\nworth the extra dough, or is it all just a bunch of hoo-ey? Let us know in the comments!

{"page": 26, "lesson": 10, "title": "Honey: bacteria's worst enemy", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/GkUKGiSM", "transcript": {"en": "Honey. You’ve met honey. It’s that sticky, sweet stuff. Basically just slightly liquidy sugar in a\nplastic bear bottle, right? Wrong! Honey is a supercharged bacteria-killing powerhouse. And it’s all down to what those hardworking\nbees put into it, from immune proteins to the sugar itself. Since ancient times, honey has been used to\nprevent wounds from getting infected. And these days, we use purified and standardized\nversions of honey to fight infections in hospitals. Honey has three main tricks for fighting bacteria. The first is all that sugar. Honey is only about 17% water. Most--but not all--of what remains is sugar. The two main types of sugar in honey are glucose\nand fructose. Like all sugars, glucose and fructose are\nsticky -- they attract water. Honey is technically a supersaturated solution,\nmeaning it contains more sugar than would normally dissolve at that temperature. That’s why it eventually gets all crystally\nin the pantry -- over time, the sugar comes out of the solution. Chemically speaking, it’s desperate for\nwater. Water can travel across cell membranes from\nwhere there’s a higher concentration of water to where there’s a lower concentration. And there’s a higher concentration of water\nin a bacterium than in honey. Which means that honey will suck the juices\nright out of any bacterium -- or mold, or fungus -- that tries to set up shop. Plus, there’s isn’t enough water in honey\nfor any microorganisms to live on. So they die, and the honey doesn’t spoil. The second thing, is that when bees make honey,\nthey throw in an enzyme called glucose oxidase. And bacteria hate glucose oxidase because\nit produces two different compounds. It converts glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen\nperoxide. Gluconic acid is, you guessed it, an acid. It gives honey a pH value of less than 4. That’s about a thousand times more acidic\nthan the neutral pH of 7 that most bacteria need to grow. And hydrogen peroxide is very good at killing\ncells. It destroys the cell walls of bacteria, which\nbreaks them apart. Glucose oxidase isn’t active in ripe honey--there’s\nnot enough water for it to work properly. It seems to be there to keep the honey from\nspoiling while the bees are drying it out. But if you dilute honey, the glucose oxidase\nwill switch back on and make gluconic acid again. The final thing bees do to make honey antibacterial? They put antibiotics in it. Some types of honey contain a protein called\nbee defensin-1, which is exactly what it sounds like. Bee defensin-1 defends bees. It’s part of their immune system and protects\nthem from certain bacteria, including ones that could cause nasty diseases inside the\nhive. It’s produced in a gland that bees use to\nmake honey, so it makes sense that some of it would make it into the finished product. And while scientists aren’t sure how much\nof the protein is really in honey, it sort of makes sense that bees would use it to protect\ntheir food. Another antibacterial compound sometimes found\nin honey is methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal is a small organic molecule\nthat forms in honey from a compound in the nectar of certain flowers. There’s an especially large amount of methylglyoxal\nin manuka honey, a honey made from a New Zealand flower. This honey is so good at killing bacteria\nthat it’s actually used in hospitals. There’s one bacterium that has honey’s\nnumber--but only sort of. It’s the type of bacteria that that causes\nbotulism. The bacteria start out as spores, which are\nvery hard to kill. They’re already dried out, so honey’s\nwater-sucking properties don’t kill them, and because the spores aren’t growing, they\naren’t affected by the acidity or the antibiotic compounds. The really dangerous part of the bacteria\nis the botulinum toxin they produce when they grow into mature bacteria. Less than a hundred nanograms -- that’s\nbillionths of a gram -- is enough to kill an adult. About 10% of honeys have some botulinum spores\nin them. But since the spores in honey aren’t growing\nand making toxin, they’re harmless to healthy adults. Our immune systems intercept the spores before\nthey can start growing inside of us. But the immune systems of infants aren’t\nalways able to kill those spores before they start growing. So, in rare cases, the bacteria can germinate\nand start producing toxin. That’s why it’s not safe to give honey\nto infants under one year old, but the rest of us don’t need to worry about it. So the next time you’re looking for something\nsweet, go ahead -- eat some of bacteria’s worst enemy. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow,\nwhich was brought to you by our patrons on Patreon.

{"page": 26, "lesson": 11, "title": "Are naked mole rats the strangest mammals? - Thomas Park", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/are-naked-mole-rats-the-strangest-mammals-thomas-park", "transcript": {"en": "What mammal has \nthe social life of an insect, the cold-bloodedness of a reptile, and the metabolism of a plant? Bald and buck-toothed, naked mole rats \nmay not be pretty, but they’re extraordinary. With a lifespan of 30 years, their peculiar traits have evolved \nover millions of years to make them uniquely suited \nto survive harsh conditions, especially long periods without oxygen. In the deserts of East Africa, \nnaked mole rats feed on root vegetables. They dig for the roots with teeth that\ncan move independently, like chopsticks. But even with these special teeth, a single naked mole rat doesn’t stand \na chance of finding enough food; the roots are large and\nnutritious, but scattered far and wide. A large workforce has \na much better chance, so naked mole rats live in colonies. Similar to ants, bees, and termites, \nthey build giant nests. Housing up to 300 mole rats, these colonies feature complex \nunderground tunnel systems, nest chambers, and community bathrooms. Also like insects, naked mole rats \nhave a rigid social structure. The dominant female, the queen, and two to three males \nthat she chooses, are the only naked mole rats \nin the colony who have babies. All the other naked mole rats, male and female, are either soldiers, who defend \nthe colony from possible invaders, or workers. Teams of workers are dispatched \nto hunt for roots, and their harvest feeds the whole colony. Living in a colony helps naked mole rats \nfind enough food, but when so many animals live in \nthe same underground space, oxygen quickly runs out. Mammals need a lot of oxygen; we use it to make the energy \nthat fuels everything from maintaining our body temperatures to our heartbeats to voluntary movements. Without oxygen, we quickly die. In fact, no other mammal could survive \nthe oxygen depletion experienced in a naked mole rat colony. Naked mole rats can thrive in low oxygen in part because they’ve abandoned \none of the body functions that requires the most oxygen: thermoregulation. Most mammals are warm-blooded, meaning they have to keep \ntheir body temperature consistent. Naked mole rats don’t get enough \noxygen to do this. Instead, they’re the only mammals whose body temperature fluctuates \nwith their environment, making them cold-blooded, like reptiles. They also have a special \ntype of hemoglobin, the molecule in the blood \nthat transports oxygen. Their hemoglobin is much stickier \nfor oxygen than ours and can pick oxygen up \neven when it’s scarce. In response to a real oxygen emergency, naked mole rats enter \na state of suspended animation. They stop moving, slow their breathing, and dramatically lower their heart rate. This greatly reduces the amount of energy,\nand therefore oxygen, they need. At the same time, they begin \nto metabolize fructose, like a plant. Fructose is a sugar that can be used \nto make energy without burning oxygen. Usually, mammals metabolize \na different sugar called glucose that makes more energy than fructose, but glucose only works \nwhen oxygen’s available. Human brain and heart cells have \nsome cellular machinery to use fructose, but not nearly as much as naked mole rats. Naked mole rats are, in fact, the only\nmammals known to have this ability. While we can hope humans won’t ever need to exclusively live \nin underground tunnels, there are many situations where \nwe would benefit from needing less oxygen. During heart attacks \nand other medical emergencies, people often die or sustain debilitating \norgan damage from oxygen deprivation. Could we replicate the naked mole rat’s \nuse of the fructose pathway for human health? It took millions of years of evolution \nto bring the behavior of an insect, the temperature regulation of a reptile, and the energy production of a plant together in one little mammal, but maybe, with enough study, we can replicate just a few \nof their wild adaptations."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A naked mole rat colony can consist of up to ______ individual animals.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "3"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30"}, {"label": "C", "text": "300"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Naked mole rats maintain body temperature like which other animal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Birds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lizards"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Humans"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mice"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "During an oxygen deprivation emergency, what do naked mole rats do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Enter a state of suspended animation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increase their heart rate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Run around looking for more oxygen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Breathe as fast as they can"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When oxygen is very low, what sugar can naked mole rats use to make energy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glucose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hemoglobin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Root vegetables"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fructose"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When do humans experience traumatic oxygen deprivation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "During a cold or flu"}, {"label": "B", "text": "During a heart attack"}, {"label": "C", "text": "While searching for food"}, {"label": "D", "text": "While sleeping"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Crawling around on eight legs, this creature has no eyes to appreciate \nthe kaleidoscope of colors around her. She relies on her extraordinary \nsense of smell to lead her to food \nand safe places to lay eggs. And she’s smaller than a pinhead. Dermatophagoides farinae is a dust mite. Less than a tenth the size of an ant, a dust mite’s whole world is contained \nin the dusty film under a bed or in a forgotten corner. This realm is right under our noses,\nbut from our perspective, the tiny specks of brilliant color \nblend together into a nondescript grey. What are these colorful \nmicroscopic particles? What distinguishes the dust in your\nhouse from, say, sand on a beach is that it is a mixture \nof many different ingredients. It can contain grains of sand, dead skin cells, tiny hairs and threads, animal dander, pollen, manmade pollutants, minerals from outer space, and, of course, dust mites. Dust mites eat animal dander, human skin, and some fungi. We shed dead skin cells constantly, and wherever we live, \nthey mix into the household dust. The same goes for our pets: their dander and hairs enter the mix, as do tiny pieces of thread and cotton\nfibers from our clothes. These components make \nevery household’s dust a unique blend of bits \nfrom its particular inhabitants. Household dust also contains substances \nthat blow in from the wider world. Depending on the local geology, finely ground quartz, coal, \nor volcanic ash might enter the air as atmospheric dust, along with pollen and fungal spores. Industrial activities also contribute \ncement powder, particles from car tires, and other chemicals to the airborne mix. The combination of these elements \ncan be as unique as a fingerprint. In Spain, where the land \nis rich in carbonate materials, dust contains 20 times as much calcium \nas dust in Nigeria, where the geology is quite different. After a particularly violent storm, scientists identified dust from \nthe Sahara Desert thousands of miles away in London, based on its specific composition. In the future, we may be able to pinpoint the origins \nof dust samples even more specifically, down to a particular neighborhood \nor even house - something that may be \nof great help for forensic specialists. In addition to markers of humans, \nanimals, and landscapes, dust also contains particles\nfrom further afield. When a star explodes in a distant galaxy, super hot gases vaporize \neverything nearby. Then, the dust settles;\nminerals condense out of the gas. Floating out there between planets \nand galaxies, this extraterrestrial dust contains \ntiny pieces of extinguished stars and the building blocks \nof future celestial bodies. Every year, tens of thousands \nof tons of cosmic dust lands on Earth and mingles \nwith terrestrial minerals. This blend of chemicals, minerals, \nand intergalactic particles settles out of the air onto\nsurfaces in our homes, mixing with the detritus \nof each house’s occupants. Stars explode, mountains erode, and buildings, plants, and animals are all slowly but surely \npulverized into fine grey powder. We’re all destined to become dust, but it’s also possible \nthat we came from it. Interstellar dust has been found \nto carry organic compounds through space.

His medal tally was only beaten 2,168 years\nlater by swimmer Michael Phelps. No one knows of course how fast he ran, but\nguesses range from 24-26 seconds for 180 meters. The fastest recorded 100 meters time is held\nby Usain Bolt at 9.58 seconds, which means he was running at an average of 10.43 meters\nper second or 23.34 mph (37.6 kph). It’s thought that at about 68 meters, he\nhit his fastest speed, which was 12.34 meters per second or 27.61 mph (44.4 kph). This is about as fast as any human has ever\nrun, and it’s about the speed of a galloping horse. We can compare that to one of the earliest\nrecorded sprint records, that of American sprinter Tom Burke who won the 100 meters\nat Athens in 1896 in a time of 12 seconds. While Bolt would be able to outrun a Velociraptor,\nhe would not be able to keep it up for long. The fastest recorded long distance time was\nset by Kenyan Dennis Kimetto in 2014. His time for the marathon was 2 hours 2 minutes\nand 57 seconds. This averaged at 4 minutes 41 seconds a mile. It’s thought a sub-2 hour marathon time\nis on the way, which means running the entire 26.2 miles (42 kilometers) at 13.1 mph (21\nkph). Try that at the gym on the treadmill for even\na few hundred meters and you’ll see just how incredible this man is. The average adult male jogs at about 8.3 mph\n(13.3 kph), which is a 27 second 100 meters. Women jog at an average of 6.5 mph (10.4 kph)\nor a 34 second 100 meters. It’s thought that even fit and healthy non-athlete\nadults that can run very well will only average around 15.9 miles per hour (25.5 kph), which\nwould mean a 100 meter time of around 13-14 seconds. The average healthy human walks at around\n3 miles per hour (4.8 kph). Let’s now have a look at swimming. It’s reported that almost half of the world’s\npopulation can’t swim, including 44 percent of Americans according to the U.S. Red Cross. Although the report said some people believed\nthey could swim, but weren’t able to swim well enough to be adjudged safe in the water. The fastest person in the world, ever, is\nBrazilian César Cielo. Much has been said about the great Michael\nPhelps taking on a great white shark in a race, but in terms of raw speed he’s slower\nthan Cielo. His time of 46.91 seconds in the 100 meters\nfreestyle is the fastest a human has ever swum, giving him an average speed of about\n5.3 mph (8.5 kph). That’s faster than the average jogging speed\nof the average male. It’s thought Phelps’ average speed when\nhe won gold in the 100 meters freestyle relay was about 4.7 mph (7.5 mph). The two men are about the same speed as the\naverage cod, but both would get trounced in a race with a great white shark that can reach\nspeeds of 25 mph (40kph). The average human that can swim freestyle\nis a speed of just 2 mph (3.2 kph). But how fast has a human ever travelled? That would be astronauts on NASA’s Apollo\n10 mission when they reached a top speed of 24,791 mph (39,897 kph). Elon Musk’s SpaceX plans to colonize Mars,\nand to get there they need a fair bit of power. The rocket which will be used is nicknamed\nthe BFS, and SpaceX says it will reach cruising speeds of 62,000 mph (99.77 thousand kph). British Royal Air Force fighter pilot Andy\nGreen holds the world land speed record, set in 1997. He got up to 763 mph (1,227 kph) in his Thrust\nsupersonic car in the Black Rock desert, USA. In 1898 a Frenchman broke the same land speed\nrecord in his electric car, reaching a speed of 39.24 mph (63 kph). The fastest two wheels have ever gone is 394\nmph (634 kph) with the TOP 1 Ack Attack ridden by Rocky Robinson at the Bonneville Speedway\nin Utah. These machines are not built for the road,\nhowever, but some road cars and bikes can reach impressive speeds. The Bugatti Veyron is listed as the world’s\nfastest road car, able to reach speeds of 268 mph (431 kph) and the fastest thing on\ntwo wheels on the road is the Kawasaki Ninja H2R. It can reach speeds of 249 mph (400 kph). The fastest person on a bicycle was Dutch\ncyclist Fred Rompelberg, who travelled at a speed of 167 mph (268 kph) in 1995. As for rail, the winner for the fastest speed\nis US air force colonel John Stapp, who reached 632 mph (1017 kph) on his rocket sled. Passenger trains don’t get anywhere near\nthat, but some are very fast. The French TVG has an average speed when taking\nfolks around France of about 200 mph (321 kph), but it also holds the record for the\nfastest speed ever on a national rail system of 357 mph (574 kph). At that speed you could realistically commute\nfrom Paris to offices in the UK, Germany, Spain, and other nations surrounding France. Japan’s magnetically levitated MLX01 maglev\nhas hit a speed of 361 mph (580 kph), but that was only in testing. Many countries are presently developing high-speed\ntrains as an alternative to air and road travel. You’d think the perfect country for such\na system would be the United States, given its size, population, and long distances its\ncitizens often travel. This is actually a matter of controversy,\nas an article in Forbes points out in 2017. There are many reasons, and one is that the\nU.S. as you’ll know from our other shows spends little on transportation compared to\nits military. Andy Kunz, president of the U.S. High Speed Rail Association, once said in\nan interview that lobbying efforts Spirit of Australiafrom oil, aviation and highway\ncompanies were also blocking high-speed rail advancement. Perhaps Elon Musk’s Boring Company and its\nunderground Hyperloop project might happen before high-speed rail. On water the record was set by Australian\nKen Warby in his Spirit of Australia wooden speedboat, which reached 317.596 mph (511\nkph) in 1978. It’s not a record many people try to break\nas they often end up dead. Long-time British record holder Donald Campbell\nwas one of those people, and there were many more. Record holder Warby told Wired in an interview\nafter he retired, “When you look down that lake, you better have all your homework done,\nbecause your chances are 50-50 – and you better be in the right 50 percent.” It might be safer to travel by ocean liner. The fastest was the SS United States, that\naveraged a speed of 29 mph (62 kph). The Titanic was a good 8 mph slower. Finally, we take to the air. Surprisingly, the record set for a manned\naircraft was as far back as 1967. That was when a hypersonic rocket-powered\naircraft called the North American X-15 hit a speed of 4,520 mph (7,274 kph) with American\nair force pilot William Knight at the controls. Passenger jets average a speed of 575 mph\n(925 kph) but may reach up to about 745 mph (1198 kph). The fastest ever passenger plane was the British-French\nmade Concorde, which reached speeds of 1,354 mph (2,180 kph). A plane called the Baby Boom is set to beat\nthat speed in 2023, but it will be a much smaller machine. That’s the end of the show today. Why not tell us your fastest speed?

If you’ve never had a nosebleed before,\nthe first one can be terrifying. Especially if you’re young when it happens and have\nno idea what’s going on. All you know is that blood is leaking out of your face...for\nno reason. But of course, now that you are older you\nknow that there is a reason your nose started to bleed...you were experiencing a condition\nknown as epistaxis. When this occurs, it can be one of two types: anterior or posterior.\nMore than likely, you’ll get an anterior nosebleed which is caused by irritation to\nblood vessels in the nasal septum. That’s the part of your nose that separates\nyour two nostrils. And it’s also the part of your nose that can get deviated, which\ncan lead to difficulty breathing. And fun fact: it’s estimated that 80% of people\nhave some type of misalignment to their nasal septum. If I had a nose, I could attest to\nthat, but sadly my face is pretty featureless. As you can see. But a block can dream! Anyway, in the nasal septum is an area called\nthe Kiesselbach plexus, where four different arteries come together to form a network of\nblood vessels. So, when this area is irritated by either a vigorous blow or a roaming finger,\nsome of the blood vessels may break. And then you get blood running down your face and possibly\ndown the back of your throat. But what about dry air? In the northern hemisphere,\nwinter is coming up and with it comes a lot of nosebleeds. The decreased humidity and\ntemperature prevent your nose from getting the moisture it needs. This then makes the\nmucous membrane more susceptible to bleeding and...Voila! You’ve got blood leaking down\nyour nostril. The only thing more unappealing than that is saying the words “mucous membrane.” So how do you stop the blood? It’s recommended\nthat you pinch the soft part of your nose for ten minutes, making sure to keep the nostrils\nclosed. This pressure helps the blood to clot and stops the bleeding. Oh, and lean forward\nduring this because otherwise, as I previously mentioned, blood can leak down the back of\nyour throat. (Which you don't want.) However, if you are lucky enough to be near a doctor when you get a nosebleed,\nif they can easily see the broken blood vessel, they may be able to cauterize, or seal, it\nusing silver nitrate. So do yourself a favor and keep all fingers\nand foreign objects away from your nostrils. Your nose and future self will thank you. Have you ever had a nosebleed? Do you get them often?

(Laughter) But have you ever gone to a bar and come out with a $200 million business? That's what happened to us\nabout 10 years ago. We'd had a terrible day. We had this huge client\nthat was killing us. We're a software consulting firm, and we couldn't find\na very specific programming skill to help this client deploy\na cutting-edge cloud system. We have a bunch of engineers, but none of them could please this client. And we were about to be fired. So we go out to the bar, and we're hanging out\nwith our bartender friend Jeff, and he's doing\nwhat all good bartenders do: he's commiserating with us,\nmaking us feel better, relating to our pain, saying, \"Hey, these guys\nare overblowing it. Don't worry about it.\" And finally, he deadpans us and says, \"Why don't you send me in there? I can figure it out.\" So the next morning,\nwe're hanging out in our team meeting, and we're all a little hazy ... (Laughter) and I half-jokingly throw it out there. I say, \"Hey, I mean,\nwe're about to be fired.\" So I say, \"Why don't we send in\nJeff, the bartender?\" (Laughter) And there's some silence,\nsome quizzical looks. Finally, my chief of staff says,\n\"That is a great idea.\" (Laughter) \"Jeff is wicked smart. He's brilliant. He'll figure it out. Let's send him in there.\" Now, Jeff was not a programmer. In fact, he had dropped out of Penn\nas a philosophy major. But he was brilliant, and he could go deep on topics, and we were about to be fired. So we sent him in. After a couple days of suspense, Jeff was still there. They hadn't sent him home. I couldn't believe it. What was he doing? Here's what I learned. He had completely disarmed\ntheir fixation on the programming skill. And he had changed the conversation, even changing what we were building. The conversation was now\nabout what we were going to build and why. And yes, Jeff figured out\nhow to program the solution, and the client became\none of our best references. Back then, we were 200 people, and half of our company was made up\nof computer science majors or engineers, but our experience with Jeff\nleft us wondering: Could we repeat this through our business? So we changed the way\nwe recruited and trained. And while we still sought after computer\nengineers and computer science majors, we sprinkled in artists,\nmusicians, writers ... and Jeff's story started to multiply\nitself throughout our company. Our chief technology officer\nis an English major, and he was a bike messenger in Manhattan. And today, we're a thousand people, yet still less than a hundred have degrees\nin computer science or engineering. And yes, we're still\na computer consulting firm. We're the number one player in our market. We work with the fastest-growing\nsoftware package to ever reach 10 billion dollars\nin annual sales. So it's working. Meanwhile, the push for STEM-based\neducation in this country -- science, technology,\nengineering, mathematics -- is fierce. It's in all of our faces. And this is a colossal mistake. Since 2009, STEM majors\nin the United States have increased by 43 percent, while the humanities have stayed flat. Our past president dedicated over a billion dollars\ntowards STEM education at the expense of other subjects, and our current president recently redirected 200 million dollars\nof Department of Education funding into computer science. And CEOs are continually complaining\nabout an engineering-starved workforce. These campaigns, coupled with the undeniable success\nof the tech economy -- I mean, let's face it, seven out of the 10 most valuable\ncompanies in the world by market cap are technology firms -- these things create an assumption that the path of our future workforce\nwill be dominated by STEM. I get it. On paper, it makes sense. It's tempting. But it's totally overblown. It's like, the entire soccer team\nchases the ball into the corner, because that's where the ball is. We shouldn't overvalue STEM. We shouldn't value the sciences\nany more than we value the humanities. And there are a couple of reasons. Number one, today's technologies\nare incredibly intuitive. The reason we've been able\nto recruit from all disciplines and swivel into specialized skills is because modern systems\ncan be manipulated without writing code. They're like LEGO: easy to put together,\neasy to learn, even easy to program, given the vast amounts of information\nthat are available for learning. Yes, our workforce\nneeds specialized skill, but that skill requires a far less\nrigorous and formalized education than it did in the past. Number two, the skills\nthat are imperative and differentiated in a world with intuitive technology are the skills that help us\nto work together as humans, where the hard work\nis envisioning the end product and its usefulness, which requires real-world experience\nand judgment and historical context. What Jeff's story taught us is that the customer\nwas focused on the wrong thing. It's the classic case: the technologist struggling to communicate\nwith the business and the end user, and the business failing\nto articulate their needs. I see it every day. We are scratching the surface in our ability as humans\nto communicate and invent together, and while the sciences teach us\nhow to build things, it's the humanities that teach us\nwhat to build and why to build them. And they're equally as important, and they're just as hard. It irks me ... when I hear people\ntreat the humanities as a lesser path, as the easier path. Come on! The humanities give us\nthe context of our world. They teach us how to think critically. They are purposely unstructured, while the sciences\nare purposely structured. They teach us to persuade,\nthey give us our language, which we use to convert our emotions\nto thought and action. And they need to be\non equal footing with the sciences. And yes, you can hire a bunch of artists and build a tech company and have an incredible outcome. Now, I'm not here today\nto tell you that STEM's bad. I'm not here today\nto tell you that girls shouldn't code. (Laughter) Please. And that next bridge I drive over or that next elevator we all jump into -- let's make sure\nthere's an engineer behind it. (Laughter) But to fall into this paranoia that our future jobs\nwill be dominated by STEM, that's just folly. If you have friends or kids\nor relatives or grandchildren or nieces or nephews ... encourage them to be\nwhatever they want to be. (Applause) The jobs will be there. Those tech CEOs that are clamoring for STEM grads, you know what they're hiring for? Google, Apple, Facebook. Sixty-five percent\nof their open job opportunities are non-technical: marketers, designers,\nproject managers, program managers, product managers, lawyers, HR specialists, trainers, coaches, sellers,\nbuyers, on and on. These are the jobs they're hiring for. And if there's one thing\nthat our future workforce needs -- and I think we can all agree on this -- it's diversity. But that diversity shouldn't end\nwith gender or race. We need a diversity of backgrounds and skills, with introverts and extroverts and leaders and followers. That is our future workforce. And the fact that the technology\nis getting easier and more accessible frees that workforce up to study whatever they damn well please. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 26, "lesson": 16, "title": "Can you solve the wizard standoff riddle? - Daniel Finkel", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-wizard-standoff-riddle-daniel-finkel", "transcript": {"en": "You’ve been chosen as a champion \nto represent your wizarding house in a deadly duel against\ntwo rival magic schools. Your opponents are fearsome. From the Newt-niz school, a powerful sorcerer wields a wand\nthat can turn people into fish, but his spell only works 70% of the time. And from the Leib-ton school, an even more powerful enchantress wields \na wand that turns people to statues, and it works 90% of the time. Lots are drawn, and you’re chosen \nto cast the first spell in the duel. The Newt-niz magician will go second, and the Leib-ton enchantress third, after which you’ll repeat casting in\nthat order until only one of you is left. The rules of magic duels are strict, and anyone who casts out of\norder immediately forfeits the duel. Also, to prevent draws, the rules stipulate that \nif everyone’s still standing at the end of the first round, you’ll all be turned into cats. Now, you must choose a wand. Your wizarding house presents you \nwith three options: the Bannekar, which binds \none target with vines and casts effectively 60% of the time, the Gaussian, \nwhich turns one target into a tree and works 80% of the time, and the incredibly rare Noether 9000, which banishes one target \nto a distant mountaintop and casts perfectly 100% of the time. Your opponents are masters of strategy, \nas well as sorcery, and you know they’ll make the choices that\nmaximize their own chances of success. Which wand should you choose and what strategy should you employ to have the greatest chance \nof winning the duel? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You reach for the Noether 9000 first. After all, it makes sense to enter \nthe duel with the most powerful wand. But before you pick it up, you consider \nwhat would happen. As the most dangerous wizard, you’d also be the target \nof the other two magicians, and you’d need to take \ncare of the most dangerous of them first. But afterward, there’s a 70% chance you'd\nbe struck down by the remaining wizard. That’s trouble. Maybe it’s better to take the Gaussian. It works 80% of the time, which means you wouldn’t be a target\nuntil the enchantress was incapacitated. But if you succeeded in transforming her, you’d probably be turned \ninto a fish immediately after. If you transformed the sorcerer, the enchantress would almost \ncertainly turn you to stone. It would really be better if you missed. And that’s when you have an idea: what if you took the Gaussian, \nthen missed on purpose? Then, you would wait for the sorcerer \nto attack the enchantress, and you’d have an 80% chance \nof winning against the sorcerer. It’s a good idea, but there’s a problem; the sorcerer could also pass his turn and the enchantress, knowing that\nshe couldn’t pass without becoming a cat, would cast her spell on one of you. And since you’re the most dangerous \nbetween you and the sorcerer, you’d be the target. And that’s when you see \nwhat you really need to do: take the weakest wand, the Bannekar,\nand miss on purpose. Now the sorcerer knows that \nhe’ll be targeted by the enchantress and he’ll have to try to turn her into \na fish to avoid being turned into stone. Seventy percent of the time he’d succeed and you’d have a 60% chance \nof winning the duel at the beginning of the next round. If he fails, chances are he’ll be \nturned to stone and you’d still have a 60% chance of\nwinning the duel against the enchantress. There’s a slim 3% chance \nyou’ll all be turned into cats, but when everything’s accounted for, you have better than even odds \nof winning with this strategy. And that’s the best you can do.

Now, unless you’re an artist, you’ve probably\nnever even seen a pencil that’s not number 2, also known as an HB pencil outside the\nU.S. The thing is, if you used any other kind of\npencil when you took an automatically-scored test, you’d probably be fine. However there are reasons that test instructions\nstill tell you to stick to number 2. And they have a lot to do with how machines\nscore your tests -- or at least, how they used to. In 1931, a high school physics teacher named\nReynold Johnson was grading exams when he wondered if there might be a way to score\nthem without actually having to go through every single answer by hand. He knew that graphite, the writing material\nin pencils, was electrically conductive. It’s made of flat sheets of carbon, and\nits outer electrons are relatively free to move around within the material. So Johnson devised a machine with many small\nelectrical circuits that would pass over an answer sheet. If there was a pencil mark on the sheet, it\nwould conduct electricity through one of the circuits, and the machine could record it\nas an answer. Eventually, he sold the idea to IBM, which\nproduced the first mark-sensing machines. But the number 2 thing didn’t become an\nissue until the next generation of machines were introduced in the 1960s and 70s. Those machines had light-sensing devices called\nphototubes, and if they did not detect light in a certain spot, they recorded it as an\nanswer. That made graphite especially useful, because\nit’s better at blocking light than many inks. Graphite reflects most light -- that’s why\npencil marks are so shiny -- and absorbs the rest, which is why it’s black. But for a long time, these optical mark-sensing\nmachines were very picky. And that’s where the different grades of\npencil came in. The graphite in pencils is held together by\nclay, so manufacturers can control how soft or hard it is, and also how dark it is. The softer the graphite, the darker the pencil’s\nmark. Pencils are labeled accordingly. In the United States, those labels are numbers. International manufacturers use a different\nsystem, with HB corresponding to number 2. Number 2 pencils make marks that are just\ndark enough to be sensed by the machine, but also light enough to be erased without leaving\na readable mark. These days, scoring machines use much more\nadvanced sensors that can detect almost any sort of marks you make, as long as they’re\nin the bubbles. So you could probably take your next exam\nwith any kind of pencil you wanted. But your SATs probably aren’t the time to\ntest that hypothesis. Maybe bring a couple of number 2’s just\nto be safe.

I mean, who doesn't enjoy making somebody\nlaugh? Especially when they can't help but laugh. But when you think about it, tickling -- that's\njust a weird thing. What is that? Why does it exist? The word \"tickling\" is actually an umbrella\nterm for two different phenomena. The first we're going to talk about is knismesis. That's the kind of itchy feeling that you\nget when somebody puts a feather on your sensitive skin and it's like gnaaaah. That sensation creates a desire to, like,\nrub or scratch, but it doesn't cause you to laugh. That kind of tickling is called gargalesis,\nwhich is caused by a harder touch or stroke that unleashes a confusing cocktail of pain\nand pleasure into the brain. Now, knismesis makes sense. If an insect or spider crawls on your leg,\nyou feel a tickling sensation, and you, you get it off. Knismesis is widespread in mammals: a horse\nwhips its tail when a fly lands on its back, and a cat's ears twitch when you brush 'em. Gargalesis, on the other hand -- and I love\nthat word -- is only experienced by primates, which include humans. When you tickle a chimp, it lets out a noiseless\npant that is the evolutionary precursor to a human laugh. And all us primates are ticklish in the same\nspots: The ribs, under the arms, under the chin, near the femoral artery in the leg...\nthese are all vulnerable areas of the body, leading some psychologists to theorize that\ngargalesis is an evolutionary mechanism that young apes and humans use to teach each other\nhow to protect themselves if attacked, the equivalent of, like, puppies play-fighting. We instinctively curl away from a tickle. We kick and twist, but we also laugh and smile,\nwhich is an encouraging facial expression which tells the tickler, \"More! Please!\" If tickling induced a negative facial expression,\nthe thinking goes, then people wouldn't do it to each other, and we wouldn't learn how\nto defend ourselves. So the next time you attack your brother with\na storm of tickle-fingers, you can say, \"Dude. I'm just teaching you life skills!\" Thanks for asking this fascinating question.

{"page": 26, "lesson": 20, "title": "What if you never forgot anything?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/JnlIOBsS", "transcript": {"en": "Thank you to brilliant dot org for supporting\nPBS Digital Studios. Sherlock Holmes, the legendary detective,\nhad a theory that the brain is like an attic where a person can only store a limited amount\nof memories. Dr. Watson once told him that the Earth travels\naround the sun, duh, to which Holmes replied, “Now that I do know it I shall do my best\nto forget it.” Holmes figured, clutter your attic with random\nfacts and trivia, and you won’t have room for the things that matter, like identifying\nthe tiny differences between lethal poisons. Was Holmes right? Is our memory limited, like the storage capacity\nof a computer? Or is our memory unlimited? And if we did have perfect memory, what would\nlife be like if you never forgot anything? [OPEN] The animated film Inside Out depicted memories\nas glowing spheres stacked in the brain, like books in a library. But the reality is a little more complicated. There is no one place in the brain that serves\nas our memory bank. Instead, individual memories are scattered\nall over the brain. Many brain cells, in several different regions,\nwork together to make one memory. For example, a memory of eating grandma’s\napple pie might involve some brain cells to help you remember what the pie looked like,\nothers to remember the smell of the cinnamon, and even cells to remember the delicious taste\n– just to name a few. In reality, though, a memory isn’t a physical\nthing that we can find in any given brain cell. It’s an action, not an object. Think of baseball fans doing “the wave”:\nno single fan IS the wave, the magic only happens when all the fans are together, doing\ntheir thing in a specific order. In the same way, a memory only happens when\nmany connected neurons fire in a specific pattern. And because the same cells can fire in many\nunique patterns, one group of neurons can encode multiple memories. This increases the memory storage capacity\nof the brain. Buried deep in the middle of the brain we\nfind a group of cells shaped like a seahorse, which is why 18th century scientists named\nthis bit the ‘hippocampus.’ Without your seahorse, you might never remember. We owe a lot of our understanding of memories\nto one famous patient, known for years only by his initials, H.M. In 1953, H.M. underwent a surgery for epilepsy\nwhich demolished most of his hippocampus, and for the rest of his life, he exhibited\na severe type of amnesia where he was unable to form new memories of facts or events, but,\nhe was still able to remember things he had learned before the surgery. This showed us that the hippocampus is a key\nto making memories, but that it isn’t where memories are stored. So how do experiences become memories? If we look inside the brain of a mouse in\na maze, we could draw a kind of map, showing which brain cells\nare active as the mouse experiences something [mouse in maze]. Later, we would see\nthe mouse's brain cells firing in the same patterns, replaying the experience in fast\nforward, over and over, backwards and forwards, to make the connections\nbetween cells stronger. This is called consolidation, and it’s how\nanimals - including humans - commit new memories to long-term storage. Days or weeks later, a smell might trigger\nthis same pattern of cells nerve firing in the mouse brain, a recall of the maze memories\n- just like smelling cinnamon might trigger memories of grandma for you. But the brain’s way of creating memories\nisn’t foolproof. Sometimes, our mental replay of something\nwe only imagined can feel as vivid as a real experience. If you picture all the sights, smells, and\nsounds of a crime scene from someone’s description, you activate similar brain networks as if\nyou had really been there. The more you replay the scene in your mind,\nthe more it feels like a real memory. That’s why a detective who asks leading\nquestions can inadvertently plant a false memory in a witness. We’re able to remember a lot, but we forget\neven more. Some forgetting just happens, but our brains\nalso forget on purpose. We have at least three different ways of forgetting. The first is what happens when a memory fades\nover time, so-called “passive oblivescence” (a term you will probably forget). This may happen because the connections between\nbrain cells gradually weaken over time; or perhaps the memory is still there, but you\nmight lose the triggers–sights, sounds, smells–you need to retrieve it. Another idea says memories could theoretically\nlast forever, but when the same neurons get used in other memories, this “interference”\ndisrupts the original memory. This slow fade type of forgetting happens\nto all of us, eventually. A second type of forgetting–targeted forgetting–happens\nat night while we sleep. This is when we clear out random, useless\ntidbits of information we’ve learned during the day and erase outdated memories. For example, if yesterday, you thought Earth\nwas, say, a flat disk supported by three elephants, and today you learned that the Earth is round,\nyour brain needs to purge one of these contradictory ideas - hopefully, the one about the elephants. In certain stages of sleep, we trim and prune\nconnections between cells and erase unneeded memory circuits. The third type of forgetting is motivated\nforgetting, something we all wish we could do for one thing or another. This is when a person intentionally suppresses\nunpleasant memories. Forgetting on purpose is a way to regulate\nour emotions and to focus on what needs to be done in the present, instead of getting\nlost in negative memories of the past. We may need motivated forgetting to maintain\nour self-image, to maintain confidence, to stay optimistic about the future, or to be\nable to maintain relationships with people who have hurt us. We don’t know exactly how motivated forgetting\nhappens, but part of our brain seems to step in and block the troubling memory from being\nretrieved. So that even though it’s still somewhere\nin our brain, eventually we can’t find it. Our brains have so many ways to forget because\nforgetting is one of the most important things we do. Forgetting allows us to move past traumatic\nlife events. In fact, PTSD may be a problem where someone\nsimply remembers too much. Forgetting also allows us to clear out junk. Imagine every sight, sound, smell, and piece\nof information your brain processes every day! If our brains didn’t sweep out the garbage\nevery night, we would soon overflow our neural networks with random useless trivia, just\nlike Sherlock Holmes predicted. We also wouldn’t be able to replace things\nthat are no longer true with better information and update our mental models of the world. Deep in the scientific literature we find\nstories of a handful of people who NEVER forget anything. They are so rare that their unforgetfulness\nhas a medical name: hyperthymesia. The most famous case is Jill Price, an American\nwoman now in her fifties. Starting from age 14, Jill’s memory of her\nlife is nearly perfect. For any date in the past, she remembers what\nshe wore and had for lunch that day, key historical events that she paid attention to, and detailed\nincidents from her life. She describes memories playing in her mind\nin vivid detail like a video reel that has been enhanced with smells and emotions, whether\nthe events occurred yesterday or decades ago. This might sound like a blessing, especially\nif you’re in school, but Jill has described being haunted by upsetting memories and by\nregrets, because unlike the rest of us, she can clearly remember every choice she made\nand how it turned out. There’s probably something you truly *want*\nto forget, like that extremely embarrassing moment in high school that always seems to\npop up at the worst times. Can we erase those unwanted memories somehow? In an episode of House, MD, Dr. House treated\na patient suffering from painful memories by performing something called electroconvulsive\ntherapy: controlled electric shocks to the brain. People who undergo ECT do lose some memories\n– only not necessarily the ones they hope. When it comes to erasing memories in humans,\nour best tool still works like a hammer, not a scalpel. It’s no accident that our ability to forget,\nlike our ability to remember, is a complex and finely-tuned mechanism. If humans couldn’t remember and learn from\nimportant events, our species probably wouldn’t have survived. But it seems that being able to forget is\njust as critical, an elementary part of solving this great mystery we call life. Stay curious! So you probably can’t teach yourself to\nhave perfect memory, and never forget anything. Not without a massive brain injury or something. But is memorization really the best way to\nlearn something? Memorizing can definitely help you get started\nwith a new concept. However, truly understanding it requires much\nmore - seeing how concepts are related to each other, looking for different interpretations,\ndealing with new information.

{"page": 26, "lesson": 21, "title": "How to tame your wandering mind", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/TFs5JFxz", "transcript": {"en": "Consider the following statement: human beings only use 10 percent\nof their brain capacity. Well, as a neuroscientist, I can tell you that while Morgan Freeman\ndelivered this line with the gravitas\nthat makes him a great actor, this statement is entirely false. (Laughter) The truth is, human beings use 100 percent\nof their brain capacity. The brain is a highly efficient,\nenergy-demanding organ that gets fully utilized and even though it is\nat full capacity being used, it suffers from a problem\nof information overload. There's far too much in the environment\nthan it can fully process. So to solve this problem of overload, evolution devised a solution, which is the brain's attention system. Attention allows us to notice, select and direct\nthe brain's computational resources to a subset of all that's available. We can think of attention\nas the leader of the brain. Wherever attention goes,\nthe rest of the brain follows. In some sense, it's your brain's boss. And over the last 15 years, I've been studying\nthe human brain's attention system. In all of our studies,\nI've been very interested in one question. If it is indeed the case\nthat our attention is the brain's boss, is it a good boss? Does it actually guide us well? And to dig in on this big question,\nI wanted to know three things. First, how does attention\ncontrol our perception? Second, why does it fail us, often leaving us feeling\nfoggy and distracted? And third, can we do anything\nabout this fogginess, can we train our brain\nto pay better attention? To have more strong and stable attention\nin the work that we do in our lives. So I wanted to give you a brief glimpse into how we're going to look at this. A very poignant example of how our attention\nends up getting utilized. And I want to do it using the example\nof somebody that I know quite well. He ends up being part of a very large\ngroup of people that we work with, for whom attention\nis a matter of life and death. Think of medical professionals or firefighters or soldiers or marines. This is the story of a marine captain,\nCaptain Jeff Davis. And the scene that I'm going to share\nwith you, as you can see, is not about his time in the battlefield. He was actually on a bridge, in Florida. But instead of looking\nat the scenery around him, seeing the beautiful vistas and noticing the cool ocean breezes, he was driving fast and contemplating\ndriving off that bridge. And he would later tell me that it took\nall of everything he had not to do so. You see, he'd just returned from Iraq. And while his body was on that bridge, his mind, his attention,\nwas thousands of miles away. He was gripped with suffering. His mind was worried and preoccupied and had stressful memories\nand, really, dread for his future. And I'm really glad\nthat he didn't take his life. Because he, as a leader,\nknew that he wasn't the only one that was probably suffering; many of his fellow marines\nprobably were, too. And in the year 2008, he partnered with me\nin the first-of-its-kind project that actually allowed us to test and offer\nsomething called mindfulness training to active-duty military personnel. But before I tell you about\nwhat mindfulness training is, or the results of that study, I think it's important to understand\nhow attention works in the brain. So what we do in the laboratory is that many of our studies of attention\ninvolve brain-wave recordings. In these brain wave recordings,\npeople wear funny-looking caps that are sort of like swimming caps,\nthat have electrodes embedded in them. These electrodes pick up\nthe ongoing brain electrical activity. And they do it with millisecond\ntemporal precision. So we can see these small yet detectable\nvoltage fluctuations over time. And doing this, we can very precisely\nplot the timing of the brain's activity. About 170 milliseconds after we show our research participants\na face on the screen, we see a very reliable,\ndetectable brain signature. It happens right at the back of the scalp, above the regions of the brain\nthat are involved in face processing. Now, this happens so reliably\nand so on cue, as the brain's face detector, that we've even given\nthis brain-wave component a name. We call it the N170 component. And we use this component\nin many of our studies. It allows us to see the impact\nthat attention may have on our perception. I'm going to give you a sense\nof the kind of experiments that we actually do in the lab. We would show participants\nimages like this one. You should see a face and a scene\noverlaid on each other. And what we do is we ask our participants as they're viewing a series\nof these types of overlaid images, to do something with their attention. On some trials, we'll ask them\nto pay attention to the face. And to make sure they're doing that, we ask them to tell us,\nby pressing a button, if the face appeared to be male or female. On other trials, we ask them to tell what the scene was --\nwas it indoor or outdoor? And in this way,\nwe can manipulate attention and confirm that the participants\nwere actually doing what we said. Our hypotheses about attention\nwere as follows: if attention is indeed doing its job\nand affecting perception, maybe it works like an amplifier. And what I mean by this is that when we direct\nattention to the face, it becomes clearer and more salient, it's easier to see. But when we direct it to the scene,\nthe face becomes barely perceptible as we process the scene information. So what we wanted to do is look at this brain-wave component\nof face detection, the N170, and see if it changed at all as a function of where our participants\nwere paying attention -- to the scene or the face. And here's what we found. We found that when they paid\nattention to the face, the N170 was larger. And when they paid attention to the scene,\nas you can see in red, it was smaller. And that gap you see\nbetween the blue and red lines is pretty powerful. What it tells us is that attention, which is really the only\nthing that changed, since the images they viewed\nwere identical in both cases -- attention changes perception. And it does so very fast. Within 170 milliseconds\nof actually seeing a face. In our follow-up studies,\nwe wanted to see what would happen, how could we perturb\nor diminish this effect. And our hunch was that if you put people\nin a very stressful environment, if you distract them with disturbing,\nnegative images, images of suffering and violence -- sort of like what you might see\non the news, unfortunately -- that doing this might\nactually affect their attention. And that's indeed what we found. If we present stressful images\nwhile they're doing this experiment, this gap of attention shrinks,\nits power diminishes. So in some of our other studies, we wanted to see, OK, great -- not great, actually, bad news\nthat stress does this to the brain -- but if it is the case that stress\nhas this powerful influence on attention through external distraction, what if we don't need\nexternal distraction, what if we distract ourselves? And to do this, we had to basically come up\nwith an experiment in which we could have people\ngenerate their own mind-wandering. This is having off-task thoughts while we're engaged\nin an ongoing task of some sort. And the trick to mind-wandering\nis that essentially, you bore people. So hopefully there's not a lot\nof mind-wandering happening right now. When we bore people, people happily generate all kinds\nof internal content to occupy themselves. So we devised what might be considered one of the world's\nmost boring experiments. All the participants saw\nwere a series of faces on the screen, one after another. They pressed the button\nevery time they saw the face. That was pretty much it. Well, one trick was that sometimes,\nthe face would be upside down, and it would happen very infrequently. On those trials they were told\njust to withhold the response. Pretty soon, we could tell that\nthey were successfully mind-wandering, because they pressed the button\nwhen that face was upside down. Even though it's quite plain to see\nthat it was upside down. So we wanted to know what happens\nwhen people have mind-wandering. And what we found was that, very similar to external stress and external distraction\nin the environment, internal distraction,\nour own mind wandering, also shrinks the gap of attention. It diminishes attention's power. So what do all of these studies tell us? They tell us that attention\nis very powerful in terms of affecting our perception. Even though it's so powerful,\nit's also fragile and vulnerable. And things like stress\nand mind-wandering diminish its power. But that's all in the context of these\nvery controlled laboratory settings. What about in the real world? What about in our actual day-to-day life? What about now? Where is your attention right now? To kind of bring it back, I'd like to make a prediction\nabout your attention for the remainder of my talk. Are you up for it? Here's the prediction. You will be unaware of what I'm saying\nfor four out of the next eight minutes. (Laughter) It's a challenge,\nso pay attention, please. Now, why am I saying this? I'm surely going to assume\nthat you're going to remain seated and, you know, graciously keep\nyour eyes on me as I speak. But a growing body of literature suggests\nthat we mind-wander, we take our mind away\nfrom the task at hand, about 50 percent of our waking moments. These might be small,\nlittle trips that we take away, private thoughts that we have. And when this mind-wandering happens, it can be problematic. Now I don't think there will be\nany dire consequences with you all sitting here today, but imagine a military leader missing\nfour minutes of a military briefing, or a judge missing\nfour minutes of testimony. Or a surgeon or firefighter\nmissing any time. The consequences\nin those cases could be dire. So we might ask why do we do this? Why do we mind-wander so much? Well, part of the answer is that our mind\nis an exquisite time-traveling master. It can actually time travel very easily. If we think of the mind as the metaphor\nof the music player, we see this. We can rewind the mind to the past to reflect on events\nthat have already happened, right? Or we can go and fast-future, to plan\nfor the next thing that we want to do. And we land in this mental\ntime-travel mode of the past or the future very frequently. And we land there often\nwithout our awareness, most times without our awareness, even if we want to be paying attention. Think of just the last time\nyou were trying to read a book, got to the bottom of the page\nwith no idea what the words were saying. This happens to us. And when this happens, when we mind-wander\nwithout an awareness that we're doing it, there are consequences. We make errors. We miss critical information, sometimes. And we have difficulty making decisions. What's worse is when we experience stress. When we're in a moment of overwhelm. We don't just reflect\non the past when we rewind, we end up being in the past\nruminating, reliving or regretting events that have already happened. Or under stress, we fast-forward the mind. Not just to productively plan. But we end up catastrophizing or worrying about events that haven't happened yet and frankly may never happen. So at this point, you might be\nthinking to yourself, OK, mind-wandering's happening a lot. Often, it happens without our awareness. And under stress, it's even worse -- we mind-wander more powerfully\nand more often. Is there anything\nwe can possibly do about this? And I'm happy to say the answer is yes. From our work, we're learning that the opposite of a stressed\nand wandering mind is a mindful one. Mindfulness has to do\nwith paying attention to our present-moment experience\nwith awareness. And without any kind of emotional\nreactivity of what's happening. It's about keeping\nthat button right on play to experience the moment-to-moment\nunfolding of our lives. And mindfulness is not just a concept. It's more like practice, you have to embody this mindful\nmode of being to have any benefits. And a lot of the work that we're doing,\nwe're offering people programs that give our participants\na suite of exercises that they should do daily in order to cultivate more moments\nof mindfulness in their life. And for many of the groups\nthat we work with, high-stress groups, like I said -- soldiers,\nmedical professionals -- for them, as we know,\nmind-wandering can be really dire. So we want to make sure\nwe offer them very accessible, low time constraints\nto optimize the training, so they can benefit from it. And when we do this, what we can do\nis track to see what happens, not just in their regular lives but in the most demanding\ncircumstances that they may have. Why do we want to do this? Well, we want to, for example, give it\nto students right around finals season. Or we want to give the training\nto accountants during tax season. Or soldiers and marines\nwhile they're deploying. Why is that? Because those are the moments in which their attention\nis most likely to be vulnerable, because of stress and mind-wandering. And those are also the moments in which we want their attention\nto be in peak shape so they can perform well. So what we do in our research is we have them take\na series of attention tests. We track their attention at the beginning\nof some kind of high-stress interval, and then two months later,\nwe track them again, and we want to see\nif there's a difference. Is there any benefit of offering them\nmindfulness training? Can we protect against\nthe lapses in attention that might arise over high stress? So here's what we find. Over a high-stress interval, unfortunately, the reality is\nif we don't do anything at all, attention declines, people are worse at the end\nof this high-stress interval than before. But if we offer mindfulness training,\nwe can protect against this. They stay stable, even though\njust like the other groups, they were experiencing high stress. And perhaps even more impressive is that if people\ntake our training programs over, let's say, eight weeks, and they fully commit\nto doing the daily mindfulness exercises that allow them to learn\nhow to be in the present moment, well, they actually get better over time,\neven though they're in high stress. And this last point\nis actually important to realize, because of what it suggests to us is that mindfulness exercises\nare very much like physical exercise: if you don't do it, you don't benefit. But if you do engage\nin mindfulness practice, the more you do, the more you benefit. And I want to just bring it back\nto Captain Jeff Davis. As I mentioned to you at the beginning, his marines were involved\nin the very first project that we ever did,\noffering mindfulness training. And they showed this exact pattern,\nwhich was very heartening. We had offered them\nthe mindfulness training right before they were deployed to Iraq. And upon their return,\nCaptain Davis shared with us what he was feeling\nwas the benefit of this program. He said that unlike last time, after this deployment,\nthey were much more present. They were discerning. They were not as reactive. And in some cases,\nthey were really more compassionate with the people they were\nengaging with and each other. He said in many ways, he felt that the mindfulness\ntraining program we offered gave them a really important tool to protect against developing\npost-traumatic stress disorder and even allowing it to turn\ninto post-traumatic growth. To us, this was very compelling. And it ended up\nthat Captain Davis and I -- you know, this was about\na decade ago, in 2008 -- we've kept in touch all these years. And he himself has gone on\nto continue practicing mindfulness in a daily way. He was promoted to major, he actually then ended up retiring\nfrom the Marine Corps. He went on to get a divorce,\nto get remarried, to have a child, to get an MBA. And through all of these challenges\nand transitions and joys of his life, he kept up with his mindfulness practice. And as fate would have it,\njust a few months ago, Captain Davis suffered a massive\nheart attack, at the age of 46. And he ended up calling me\na few weeks ago. And he said, \"I want\nto tell you something. I know that the doctors\nwho worked on me, they saved my heart, but mindfulness saved my life. The presence of mind I had\nto stop the ambulance that ended up taking me\nto the hospital,\" -- himself, the clarity of mind he had to notice\nwhen there was fear and anxiety happening but not be gripped by it -- he said, \"For me, these\nwere the gifts of mindfulness.\" And I was so relieved\nto hear that he was OK. But really heartened to see\nthat he had transformed his own attention. He went from having a really bad boss -- an attention system\nthat nearly drove him off a bridge -- to one that was an exquisite\nleader and guide, and saved his life. So I want to actually end by sharing\nmy call to action to all of you. And here it is. Pay attention to your attention. Alright? Pay attention to your attention and incorporate mindfulness training\nas part of your daily wellness toolkit, in order to tame your own wandering mind and to allow your attention\nto be a trusted guide in your own life. Thank you.

Sperm whales use echolocation \nto hunt these squid for food, but even against this gigantic animal,\nsquid can put up an impressive fight. Scientists know this because on the bodies\nof washed-up whales, they frequently find huge, \nround suction scars, emblazoned there by large, \ngrasping tentacles. Ranging in size from \nthis giant’s impressive 14 meters to the 2.5 centimeters \nof the southern pygmy squid, these creatures fall into the group \nof animals known as cephalopods. There are about 500 squid \nspecies worldwide, and they live in all the world’s oceans, making them a reliable food source\nfor whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish, and even other squid. Indeed, squid themselves \nare fearsome ocean predators. But their most extraordinary adaptations are those that have evolved \nto help them thwart their predators. Squid, which can be found mainly in estuarine, deep-sea, \nand open-water habitats, often swim together in shoals. Being out in the open without anywhere \nto hide makes them vulnerable, so as a first line of defense,\nthey rely on large, well-developed eyes. In the colossal squid, \nthese are the size of dinner plates, the largest known eyes \nin the animal kingdom. When it’s dark or the water is murky, \nhowever, squid rely on a secondary sensory system, made from thousands of tiny hair cells \nthat are only about twelve microns long and run along their heads and arms. Each of these hair cells is attached\nto axons in the nervous system. Swimming animals create a wake, so when the hairs on \nthe squid’s body detect this motion, they send a signal to the brain, which helps it determine \nthe direction of the water’s flow. This way, a squid can sense an oncoming \npredator in even the dimmest waters. Aware of the threat, a squid \ncan then mask itself from a predator. Squid skin contains thousands\nof tiny organs called chromatophores, each made of black, brown, red \nor yellow pigments and ringed in muscle. Reflecting cells beneath \nthe chromatophores mirror the squid’s surroundings,\nenabling it to blend in. So, when the muscles contract, the color of the pigment is exposed, whereas when the muscles relax \nthe colors are hidden. Each of these chromatophores is under the individual control \nof the squid’s nervous system, so while some expand, \nothers remain contracted. That enables countershading, where the underside of the squid\nis lighter than the top, to eliminate a silhouette \nthat a predator might spy from below. Some predators, however, \nlike the whales and dolphins, get around this ruse by using sound waves\nto detect a squid’s camouflaged form. Not to be outfoxed, the squid still \nhas two more tricks up its sleeve. The first involves ink, \nproduced inside its mantle. Squid ink is made mostly of mucus\nand melanin, which produces its dark coloring. When squid eject the ink, they either use it to make \na large smokescreen that completely blocks the predator’s view or a blob that roughly mimics the size \nand shape of the squid. This creates a phantom form, \ncalled a pseudomorph, that tricks the predator \ninto thinking it’s the real squid. As a final touch, \nsquid rely on jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away from their hunters, reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour\nand moving meters away in mere seconds. This makes them \nEarth’s fastest invertebrates. Some squid species have also developed \nunique adaptive behaviors. The deep-sea vampire squid,\nwhen startled, uses its webbed arms to make \na cape it hides behind. The tiny bobtail, on the other hand, \ntosses sand over its body as it burrows away from prying eyes. The Pacific flying squid \nuses jet propulsion for another purpose: to launch itself right out of the water. Squids’ inventive adaptations \nhave allowed them to proliferate \nfor over 500 million years. Even now, \nwe’re still uncovering new species. And as we do, we’re bound to discover even more\nabout how these stealthy cephalopods have mastered survival \nin the deep and unforgiving sea."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Squid are included in a group of invertebrates called ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Arthropods"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cephalopods"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Porifera"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Annelids"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the first sense that a squid uses to detect a predator?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Jet propulsion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Smell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sight"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Taste"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Tiny organs in the skin that contract and expand to show color are called ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chromatophores"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hair cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Illuminati"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eye spots"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Squid ink is comprised of the following substances: ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mucus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Melanin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both mucus and melanin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the swimming method used by squid to make a fast escape?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Padding"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tail undulations"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Full-body undulations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Jet propulsion"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 26, "lesson": 23, "title": "What makes you special?", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/gJtW1LQG", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Riaki Poništ\nReviewer: Peter van de Ven Thank you so much. I am a journalist. My job is to talk to people\nfrom all walks of life, all over the world. Today, I want to tell you why I decided to do this with my life\nand what I've learned. My story begins in Caracas, Venezuela, in South America, where I grew up; a place that to me was,\nand always will be, filled with magic and wonder. Frоm a very young age, my parents wanted me\nto have a wider view of the world. I remember one time\nwhen I was around seven years old, my dad came up to me and said, \"Mariana, I'm going to send you\nand your little sister...\" - who was six at the time - \"...to a place where nobody\nspeaks Spanish. I want you to experience\ndifferent cultures.\" He went on and on about the benefits\nof spending an entire summer in this summer camp in the United States, stressing a little phrase that I didn't pay \ntoo much attention to at the time: \"You never know what the future holds.\" Meanwhile, in my seven-year-old mind, I was thinking, we were going\nto get to summer camp in Miami. (Laughter) Maybe it was going to be even better, and we were going to go\na little further north, to Orlando, where Mickey Mouse lived. (Laughter) I got really excited. My dad, however,\nhad a slightly different plan. Frоm Caracas, he he sent us\nto Brainerd, Minnesota. (Laughter) Mickey Mouse was not up there, (Laughter) and with no cell phone,\nno Snapchat, or Instagram, I couldn't look up any information. We got there, and one of the first things I noticed was that the other kids' hair\nwas several shades of blonde, and most of them had blue eyes. Meanwhile, this is what we looked like. The first night, the camp director\ngathered everyone around the campfire and said, \"Kids, we have a very\ninternational camp this year; the Atencios are here from Venezuela.\" (Laughter) The other kids looked at us\nas if we were from another planet. They would ask us things like, \"Do you know what a hamburger is?\" Or, \"Do you go to school\non a donkey or a canoe?\" (Laughter) I would try to answer\nin my broken English, and they would just laugh. I know they were not trying to be mean; they were just trying\nto understand who we were, and make a correlation\nwith the world they knew. We could either be like them, or like characters out of a book\nfilled with adventures, like Aladdin or the Jungle Book. We certainly didn't look like them, we didn't speak their language, we were different. When you're seven years old, that hurts. But I had my little sister\nto take care of, and she cried every day at summer camp. So I decided to put on a brave face, and embrace everything I could\nabout the American way of life. We later did what we called\n\"the summer camp experiment,\" for eight years in different cities\nthat many Americans haven't even heard of. What I remember most about these moments\nwas when I finally clicked with someone. Making a friend was a special reward. Everybody wants to feel\nvalued and accepted, and we think it should happen\nspontaneously, but it doesn't. When you're different,\nyou have to work at belonging. You have to be either\nreally helpful, smart, funny, anything to be cool for the crowd\nyou want to hang out with. Later on, when I was in high school, my dad expanded on his summer plan, and from Caracas he sent me\nto Wallingford, Connecticut, for the senior year of high school. This time, I remember\ndaydreaming on the plane about \"the American high school\nexperience\" - with a locker. It was going to be perfect, just like in my favorite TV show:\n\"Saved by the Bell.\" (Laughter) I get there, and they tell me that my assigned roommate\nis eagerly waiting. I opened the door, and there she was, sitting on the bed, with a headscarf. Her name was Fatima,\nand she was Muslim from Bahrain, and she was not what I expected. She probably sensed my disappointment\nwhen I looked at her because I didn't do too much to hide it. See, as a teenager,\nI wanted to fit in even more, I wanted to be popular, maybe have a boyfriend for prom, and I felt that Fatima just got in the way with her shyness\nand her strict dress code. I didn't realize\nthat I was making her feel like the kids at summer camp made me feel. This was the high school\nequivalent of asking her, \"Do you know what a hamburger is?\" I was consumed by my own selfishness and unable to put myself in her shoes. I have to be honest with you, we only lasted a couple\nof months together, because she was later sent\nto live with a counselor instead of other students. I remember thinking, \"Ah, she'll be okay. She's just different.\" You see, when we label\nsomeone as different, it dehumanizes them in a way. They become \"the other.\" They're not worthy of our time,\nnot our problem, and in fact, they, \"the other,\"\nare probably the cause of our problems. So, how do we recognize our blind spots? It begins by understanding\nwhat makes you different, by embracing those traits. Only then can you begin to appreciate\nwhat makes others special. I remember when this hit me. It was a couple months after that. I had found that boyfriend for prom, made a group of friends, and practically forgotten about Fatima, until everybody signed on to participate\nin this talent show for charity. You needed to offer a talent for auction. It seemed like everybody\nhad something special to offer. Some kids were going to play the violin, others were going to recite\na theater monologue, and I remember thinking, \"We don't practice talents\nlike these back home.\" But I was determined\nto find something of value. The day of the talent show comes, and I get up on stage\nwith my little boom box, and put it on the side and press \"Play,\" and a song by my favorite\nemerging artist, Shakira, comes up. And I go, \"Whenever, wherever,\nwe're meant to be together,\" and I said, \"My name is Mariana,\nand I'm going to auction a dance class.\" It seemed like the whole school\nraised their hand to bid. My dance class really stood out from, like, the 10th violin class\noffered that day. Going back to my dorm room,\nI didn't feel different. I felt really special. That's when I started\nthinking about Fatima, a person that I had failed to see\nas special, when I first met her. She was from the Middle East, just like Shakira's family\nwas from the Middle East. She could have probably taught me\na thing or two about belly dancing, had I been open to it. Now, I want you all to take that sticker that was given to you \nat the beginning of our session today, where you wrote down\nwhat makes you special, and I want you to look at it. If you're watching at home,\ntake a piece of paper, and write down what makes you different. You may feel guarded when you look at it, maybe even a little ashamed,\nmaybe even proud. But you need to begin to embrace it. Remember, it is the first step\nin appreciating what makes others special. When I went back home to Venezuela, I began to understand\nhow these experiences were changing me. Being able to speak different languages, to navigate all these\ndifferent people and places, it gave me a unique sensibility. I was finally beginning to understand the importance of putting myself\nin other people's shoes. That is a big part of the reason\nwhy I decided to become a journalist. Especially being from a part of the world\nthat is often labeled \"the backyard,\" \"the illegal aliens,\"\n\"third-world,\" \"the others,\" I wanted to do something to change that. It was right around the time, however, when the Venezuelan government shut down the biggest television station\nin our country. Censorship was growing, and my dad came up to me\nonce again and said, \"How are you going to be\na journalist here? You have to leave.\" That's when it hit me. That's what he had been preparing me for. That is what the future held for me. So in 2008, I packed my bags,\nand I came to the United States, without a return ticket this time. I was painfully aware\nthat, at 24 years old, I was becoming a refugee of sorts,\nan immigrant, the other, once again, and now for good. I was able to come on a scholarship\nto study journalism. I remember when they gave me\nmy first assignment to cover the historic election\nof President Barack Obama. I felt so lucky, so hopeful. I was, like, \"Yes, this is it. I've come to post-racial America, where the notion of us and them\nis being eroded, and will probably\nbe eradicated in my lifetime.\" Boy, was I wrong, right? Why didn't Barack Obama's presidency\nalleviate racial tensions in our country? Why do some people still feel threatened by immigrants, LGBTQ, and minority groups who are just trying to find a space in this United States\nthat should be for all of us? I didn't have the answers back then, but on November 8th, 2016, when Donald Trump became\nour president, it became clear that a large part of the electorate\nsees them as \"the others.\" Some see people coming to take their jobs, or potential terrorists\nwho speak a different language. Meanwhile, minority groups oftentimes\njust see hatred, intolerance, and narrow-mindedness on the other side. It's like we're stuck in these bubbles\nthat nobody wants to burst. The only way to do it,\nthe only way to get out of it is to realize that being different\nalso means thinking differently. It takes courage to show respect. In the words of Voltaire: \"I may not agree\nwith what you have to say, but I will fight to the death\nto defend your right to say it.\" Failing to see anything good\non the other side makes a dialogue impossible. Without a dialogue, we will keep\nrepeating the same mistakes, because we will not learn anything new. I covered the 2016 election for NBC News. It was my first big assignment\nin this mainstream network, where I had crossed over\nfrom Spanish television. And I wanted to do something different. I watched election results\nwith undocumented families. Few thought of sharing that moment\nwith people who weren't citizens, but actually stood\nthe most to lose that night. When it became apparent\nthat Donald Trump was winning, this eight-year-old girl named Angelina\nrushed up to me in tears. She sobbed, and she asked me\nif her mom was going to be deported now. I hugged her back and I said,\n\"It's going to be okay,\" but I really didn't know. This was the photo we took that night,\nforever ingrained in my heart. Here was this little girl who was around the same age I was\nwhen I went to camp in Brainerd. She already knows she is \"the other.\" She walks home from school\nin fear, every day, that her mom can be taken away. So, how do we put ourselves\nin Angelina's shoes? How do we make her\nunderstand she is special, and not simply unworthy\nof having her family together? By giving camera time to her\nand families like hers, I tried to make people see them\nas human beings, and not simply \"illegal aliens.\" Yes, they broke a law, \nand they should pay a penalty for it, but they've also given\neverything for this country, like many other immigrants\nbefore them have. I've already told you how my path\nto personal growth started. To end, I want to tell you how I hit\nthe worst bump in the road yet, one that shook me to my very core. The day, April 10th, 2014, I was driving to the studio,\nand I got a call from my parents. \"Are you on the air?\" they asked. I immediately knew something was wrong. \"What happened?\" I said. \"It's your sister;\nshe's been in a car accident.\" It was as if my heart stopped. My hands gripped the steering wheel, and I remember hearing the words: \"It is unlikely she will ever walk again.\" They say your life can change\nin a split second. Mine did at that moment. My sister went from being\nmy successful other half, only a year apart in age, to not being able to move her legs, sit up, or get dressed by herself. This wasn't like summer camp,\nwhere I could magically make it better. This was terrifying. Throughout the course of two years,\nmy sister underwent 15 surgeries, and she spent the most\nof that time in a wheelchair. But that wasn't even the worst of it. The worst was something so painful,\nit's hard to put into words, even now. It was the way people looked at her, looked at us, changed. People were unable to see\na successful lawyer or a millennial with a sharp wit\nand a kind heart. Everywhere we went, I realized that people just saw\na poor girl in a wheelchair. They were unable to see\nanything beyond that. After fighting like a warrior, I can thankfully tell you\nthat today my sister is walking, and has recovered\nbeyond anyone's expectations. (Applause) Thank you. But during that traumatic ordeal, I learned there are differences\nthat simply suck, and it's hard to find positive in them. My sister's not better off\nbecause of what happened. But she taught me: you can't let\nthose differences define you. Being able to reimagine yourself\nbeyond what other people see, that is the toughest task of all, but it's also the most beautiful. You see, we all come\nto this world in a body. People with physical\nor neurological difficulties, environmentally impacted communities,\nimmigrants, boys, girls, boys who want to dress as girls,\ngirls with veils, women who have been sexually assaulted, athletes who bend\ntheir knee as a sign of protest, black, white, Asian, Native American,\nmy sister, you, or me. We all want what everyone wants:\nto dream and to achieve. But sometimes, society tells us,\nand we tell ourselves, we don't fit the mold. Well, if you look at my story, from being born somewhere different,\nto belly dancing in high school, to telling stories\nyou wouldn't normally see on TV, what makes me different is what has made me\nstand out and be successful. I have traveled the world, and talked to people\nfrom all walks of life. You know what I've learned? The single thing every one of us\nhas in common is being human. So take a stand to defend\nyour race, the human race. Let's appeal to it. Let's be humanists,\nbefore and after everything else. To end, I want you to take that sticker,\nthat piece of paper where you wrote down\nwhat makes you different, and I want you to celebrate it\ntoday and every day, shout it from the rooftops. I also encourage you\nto be curious and ask, \"What is on other people's\npieces of paper?\" \"What makes them different?\" Let's celebrate those imperfections\nthat make us special. I hope that it teaches you that nobody\nhas a claim on the word \"normal.\" We are all different. We are all quirky, and unique, and that is what makes us\nwonderfully human. Thank you so much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 26, "lesson": 24, "title": "When will the next ice age happen? - Lorraine Lisiecki", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/when-will-the-next-ice-age-happen-lorraine-lisiecki", "transcript": {"en": "Twenty thousand years ago, the Earth was a frigid landscape where \nwoolly mammoths roamed. Huge ice sheets, \nseveral thousand meters thick, encased parts of North America, \nAsia, and Europe. We commonly know it as the \"Ice Age.\" But geologists call it \nthe Last Glacial Maximum. That’s because it’s the most recent\ntime that ice reached such a huge extent, and “ice age” is an informal term \nwithout a single agreed-upon definition. Over the last million years, there have actually been \nabout 10 different glacial maxima. Throughout Earth’s history, \nclimate has varied greatly. For hundreds of millions of years, the planet had no polar ice caps. Without this ice, \nthe sea level was 70 meters higher. At the other extreme, \nabout 700 million years ago, Earth became almost \nentirely covered in ice during an event known \nas “Snowball Earth.” So what causes these massive swings \nin the planet’s climate? One of the main drivers \nis atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps heat. Natural processes, such as volcanism, chemical weathering of rocks, and the burial of organic matter, can cause huge changes in carbon dioxide \nwhen they continue for millions of years. Over the past million years, \ncarbon dioxide has been relatively low, and repeated glacial maxima have been caused by cycles \nin Earth’s movement around the sun. As Earth rotates, it wobbles on its axis \nand its tilt changes, altering the amount of sunlight that \nstrikes different parts of its surface. These wobbles, combined \nwith the planet’s elliptical orbit, cause summer temperatures to vary depending on whether the summer solstice \nhappens when Earth is closer or farther from the sun. Approximately every 100,000 years, these factors align to create dramatically\ncolder conditions that last for millennia. Cool summers that aren’t warm enough \nto melt the preceding winter’s snow allow ice to accumulate year after year. These ice sheets produce \nadditional cooling by reflecting more solar energy \nback into space. Simultaneously, cooler conditions \ntransfer carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the ocean, causing even more cooling \nand glacier expansion. About 20,000 years ago, these trends reversed when changes \nin Earth’s orbit increased summer sunshine over the giant ice sheets, \nand they began to melt. The sea level rose 130 meters and carbon dioxide was released \nfrom the ocean back into the atmosphere. By analyzing pollen and marine fossils, geologists can tell that temperatures \npeaked about 6,000 years ago, before another shift in Earth’s orbit\ncaused renewed cooling. So what’s coming next? Based on the repeated natural cycle seen \nin the climate record, we’d normally expect the Earth \nto continue a trend of gradual cooling for the next few thousand years. However, this cooling abruptly \nreversed about 150 years ago. Why? Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere \nhave been rising since the 19th century, when fossil fuel use increased. We know that from studying air bubbles \ntrapped in Antarctic ice. This surge in carbon dioxide \nalso coincides with a global temperature increase \nof nearly one degree Celsius. Ice cores \nand atmospheric monitoring stations show us that carbon dioxide levels \nare rising faster, and to higher levels, than at any point \nin the last 800,000 years. Computer models forecast another one to\nfour degrees Celsius of warming by 2100, depending on how much \nadditional fossil fuel we burn. What does that mean for the ice currently \non Greenland and Antarctica? Past climate changes suggest that even \na small warming shift can begin a process of ice melt \nthat continues for thousands of years. By the end of this century, ice melt is expected to raise \nthe sea level by 30 to 100 centimeters, enough to impact many coastal cities \nand island nations. If a four-degree Celsius warming persisted\nfor several millennia, the sea level could rise \nby as much as 10 meters. By studying past climates, scientists learn more about what drives \nthe shifts in ice that have shaped our planet \nfor millions of years. Research suggests that \nby taking action now to reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions quickly, we still have the opportunity to curb \nice loss and save our coastal communities."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When was the Last Glacial Maximum (commonly known as the “Ice Age”)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1000 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6000 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20,000 years ago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100,000 years ago"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How was atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) different during the Last Glacial Maximum?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More CO2 was put in the air by volcanic eruptions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "CO2 increased because there were fewer plants on land"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There was less CO2 in the atmosphere because it was trapped in ice"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There was less CO2 in the atmosphere because it was absorbed by the ocean"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How do scientists know what CO2 levels were in the past?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "From human measurements, which have only been available since the 18th century"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By measuring air bubbles trapped in ice sheets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By measuring plant pollen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By measuring old seawater at the bottom of the ocean"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When did Earth’s current warming trend begin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100 years ago because of fossil fuel use during the Industrial Revolution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,000 years ago because of deforestation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6,000 years ago because of changes in Earth’s orbit"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20,000 years ago because of changes in Earth’s orbit"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How much is sea level expected to rise by the year 2100?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "3-10 cm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10-30 cm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30-100 cm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "400 cm"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
