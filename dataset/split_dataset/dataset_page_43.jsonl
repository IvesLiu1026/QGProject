The answers lie in an epic story\nof seafaring warriors, nomadic invaders, and the rise and fall of a medieval state\nknown as Kievan Rus. In the first millennium, a large group of tribes spread through\nthe dense woodlands of Eastern Europe. Because they had no writing system, much of what we know about them\ncomes from three main sources: archaeological evidence, accounts from literate scholars \nof the Roman Empire and the Middle East, and, lastly, an epic history called \nthe Primary Chronicle compiled in the 12th century \nby a monk named Nestor. What they tell us is that these tribes\nwho shared a common Slavic language and polytheistic religion had by the 7th century split into\nwestern, southern and eastern branches, the latter stretching from \nthe Dniester River to the Volga and the Baltic Sea. As Nestor's story goes, after years of\nsubjugation by Vikings from the north, who, by the way, did not wear \nhorned helmets in battle, the region's tribes revolted\nand drove back the Northmen, but left to their own devices, \nthey turned on each other. Such chaos ensued that, ironically, the tribes reached out to the foreigners\nthey had just expelled, inviting them to return \nand establish order. The Vikings accepted, sending a prince\nnamed Rurik and his two brothers to rule. With Rurik's son, Oleg, \nexpanding his realm into the south, and moving the capitol to Kiev, a former outpost of the Khazar Empire, the Kievan Rus was born, \"Rus\" most likely deriving from \nan old Norse word for \"the men who row.\" The new princedom had complex relations\nwith its neighbors, alternating between alliance and warfare\nwith the Khazar and Byzantine Empires, as well as neighboring tribes. Religion played an important \nrole in politics, and as the legend goes, in 987, the Rus prince Vladamir I decided\nit was time to abandon Slavic paganism, and sent emissaries \nto explore neighboring faiths. Put off by Islam's prohibition on alcohol and Judaism's expulsion \nfrom its holy land, the ruler settled on Orthodox Christianity after hearing odd accounts \nof its ceremonies. With Vladimir's conversion and marriage\nto the Byzantine emperor's sister, as well as continued trade \nalong the Volga route, the relationship between \nthe two civilizations deepened. Byzantine missionaries created an alphabet\nfor Slavic languages based on a modified Greek script while Rus Viking warriors served as the\nByzantine Emperor's elite guard. For several generations, the Kievan Rus flourished\nfrom its rich resources and trade. Its noblemen and noblewomen married\nprominent European rulers, while residents of some cities \nenjoyed great culture, literacy, and even democratic freedoms \nuncommon for the time. But nothing lasts forever. Fratricidal disputes over succession\nbegan to erode central power as increasingly independent cities\nruled by rival princes vied for control. The Fourth Crusade \nand decline of Constantinople devastated the trade integral \nto Rus wealth and power, while Teutonic crusaders \nthreatened northern territories. The final blow, however, would \ncome from the east. Consumed by their squabbles, Rus princes paid little attention \nto the rumors of a mysterious unstoppable hoard until 1237, when 35,000 mounted \narchers led by Batu Khan swept through the Rus cities, sacking Kiev before continuing \non to Hungary and Poland. The age of Kievan Rus had come to an end,\nits people now divided. In the east, which remained \nunder Mongol rule, a remote trading post, known as Moscow, would grow to challenge \nthe power of the Khans, conquering parts \nof their fragmenting empire, and, in many ways, succeeding it. As it absorbed other \neastern Rus territories, it reclaimed the old name \nin its Greek form, Ruscia. Meanwhile, the western regions\nwhose leaders had avoided destruction through political maneuvering \nuntil the hoard withdrew came under the influence of Poland\nand Lithuania. For the next few centuries, the former lands of Kievan Rus populated by Slavs, ruled by Vikings, taught by Greeks, and split by Mongols would develop differences in society,\nculture and language that remain to the present day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which branch of the Slavic tribes would eventually form the Kievan Rus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Western"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eastern"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Northern"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Southern"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT an existent source of knowledge for early Slavic history?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Descriptions by Roman historians"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Accounts by travelers from the Middle East"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Native Slavic inscriptions from the pre-Christian era"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Writings by Byzantine missionaries and their successors"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "According to the likeliest theory, from which language does the word 'rus' originate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Old Norse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ancient Slavic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Khazar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Byzantine Greek"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "To which religion did Vladimir I convert?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Islam"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Judaism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eastern Orthodox Christianity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Roman Catholicism"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT a major contributor to the decline of Kievan Rus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mongol invasion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Teutonic crusaders"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Internal disputes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Natural disasters"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Deciphering these directions\nwould be a monumental task but could offer unprecedented insight\nabout the human body. In 1990, a consortium \nof 20 international research centers embarked on the world's largest\nbiological collaboration to accomplish this mission. The Human Genome Project proposed\nto sequence the entire human genome over 15 years \nwith $3 billion of public funds. Then, seven years \nbefore its scheduled completion, a private company called Celera announced\nthat they could accomplish the same goal in just three years\nand at a fraction of the cost. The two camps discussed a joint venture,\nbut talks quickly fell apart as disagreements arose over legal\nand ethical issues of genetic property. And so the race began. Though both teams used the same technology\nto sequence the entire human genome, it was their strategies \nthat made all the difference. Their paths diverged \nin the most critical of steps: the first one. In the Human Genome Project's approach, the genome was first divided into smaller,\nmore manageable chunks about 150,000 base pairs long that overlapped each other\na little bit on both ends. Each of these fragments of DNA was inserted inside a bacterial \nartificial chromosome where they were cloned and fingerprinted. The fingerprints showed scientists\nwhere the fragments overlapped without knowing the actual sequence. Using the overlapping bits as a guide, the researchers marked \neach fragment's place in the genome to create a contiguous map, a process that took about six years. The cloned fragments were sequenced\nin labs around the world following one of the project's\ntwo major principles: that collaboration on our shared heritage\nwas open to all nations. In each case, the fragments \nwere arbitrarily broken up into small, overlapping pieces\nabout 1,000 base pairs long. Then, using a technology \ncalled the Sanger method, each piece was sequenced letter by letter. This rigorous map-based approach\ncalled hierarchical shotgun sequencing minimized the risk of misassembly, a huge hazard of sequencing genomes\nwith many repetitive portions, like the human genome. The consortium's \n\"better safe than sorry\" approach contrasted starkly with Celera's strategy\ncalled whole genome shotgun sequencing. It hinged on skipping \nthe mapping phase entirely, a faster, though foolhardy, approach\naccording to some. The entire genome was directly chopped up into a giant heap \nof small, overlapping bits. Once these bits were sequenced\nvia the Sanger method, Celera would take the formidable risk\nof reconstructing the genome using just the overlaps. But perhaps their decision\nwasn't such a gamble because guess whose freshly completed map\nwas available online for free? The Human Genome Consortium, in accordance with \nthe project's second major principle which held that all of the project's data would be shared publicly\nwithin 24 hours of collection. So in 1998, scientists around the world were furiously sequencing \nlines of genetic code using the tried and true, yet laborious,\nSanger method. Finally, after three exhausting years\nof continuous sequencing and assembling, the verdict was in. In February 2001, both groups \nsimultaneously published working drafts of more than 90%\nof the human genome, several years ahead \nof the consortium's schedule. The race ended in a tie. The Human Genome Project's practice\nof immediately sharing its data was an unusual one. It is more typical for scientists\nto closely guard their data until they are able to analyze it\nand publish their conclusions. Instead, the Human Genome Project\naccelerated the pace of research and created an international\ncollaboration on an unprecedented scale. Since then, robust investment in both\nthe public and private sector has led to the identification\nof many disease related genes and remarkable advances \nin sequencing technology. Today, a person's genome can be sequenced\nin just a few days. However, reading the genome \nis only the first step. We're a long way away from understanding\nwhat most of our genes do and how they are controlled.

{"page": 43, "lesson": 5, "title": "3 tips to boost your confidence - TED-Ed", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/3-tips-to-boost-your-confidence-ted-ed", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Jennifer Cody\nReviewer: Jessica Ruby When faced with a big challenge where potential failure seems\nto lurk at every corner, maybe you've heard this advice before: \"Be more confident.\" And most likely, this is what you think\nwhen you hear it: \"If only it were that simple.\" But what is confidence? Take the belief that you are valuable,\nworthwhile, and capable, also known as self-esteem, add in the optimism that comes\nwhen you are certain of your abilities, and then empowered by these, act courageously \nto face a challenge head-on. This is confidence. It turns thoughts into action. So where does confidence even come from? There are several factors \nthat impact confidence. One: what you're born with,\nsuch as your genes, which will impact things like the balance\nof neurochemicals in your brain. Two: how you're treated. This includes the social pressures\nof your environment. And three: the part you have control over, the choices you make, the risks you take, and how you think about \nand respond to challenges and setbacks. It isn't possible to completely untangle\nthese three factors, but the personal choices we make\ncertainly play a major role in confidence development. So, by keeping in mind \na few practical tips, we do actually have the power to cultivate\nour own confidence. Tip 1: a quick fix. There are a few tricks that can give you\nan immediate confidence boost in the short term. Picture your success \nwhen you're beginning a difficult task, something as simple as listening to music\nwith deep bass; it can promote feelings of power. You can even strike a powerful pose\nor give yourself a pep talk. Tip two: \nbelieve in your ability to improve. If you're looking for a long-term change, consider the way you think \nabout your abilities and talents. Do you think they are fixed at birth, or that they can be developed,\nlike a muscle? These beliefs matter because\nthey can influence how you act when you're faced with setbacks. If you have a fixed mindset, meaning that you think your talents\nare locked in place, you might give up, assuming you've discovered \nsomething you're not very good at. But if you have a growth mindset\nand think your abilities can improve, a challenge is an opportunity\nto learn and grow. Neuroscience supports the growth mindset. The connections in your brain do get\nstronger and grow with study and practice. It also turns out, on average, people who have a growth mindset\nare more successful, getting better grades, and doing better \nin the face of challenges. Tip three: practice failure. Face it, you're going to fail sometimes. Everyone does. J.K. Rowling was rejected by\ntwelve different publishers before one picked up \"Harry Potter.\" The Wright Brothers built on history's\nfailed attempts at flight, including some of their own, before designing a successful airplane. Studies show that those who fail regularly\nand keep trying anyway are better equipped to respond \nto challenges and setbacks in a constructive way. They learn how to try \ndifferent strategies, ask others for advice, and perservere. So, think of a challenge \nyou want to take on, realize it's not going to be easy, accept that you'll make mistakes, and be kind to yourself when you do. Give yourself a pep talk, \nstand up, and go for it. The excitement you'll feel knowing that\nwhatever the result, you'll have gained greater knowledge\nand understanding.

But\nmountain streams are corralled by the steep-walled valleys they carve – their courses are literally\nset in stone. Out on the open plains, those stony walls give way to soft soil, allowing\nrivers much more freedom to shift their banks and set their own ever-changing courses to\nthe sea: courses that almost never run straight. At least not for long, because all it takes\nto turn a straight stretch of river into a bendy one is a little disturbance and a lot\nof time  – and in nature, there’s plenty of both.\n      Say, for example, that a muskrat  burrows\nherself a den in one bank of a stream. Her tunnels make for a cozy home,  but they also\nweaken the bank, which eventually begins to crumble and slump into the stream. Water rushes into the newly-formed hollow,\nsweeping away loose dirt and making the hollow even hollower, which lets the water rush a\nlittle faster and sweep away a little more dirt from the bank...and so on, and so on\n. As more of the stream’s flow is diverted\ninto the deepening hole on one bank and away from the other side of the channel, the flow\nthere weakens and slows. And since slow-moving water can’t carry the sand-sized particles\nthat fast-moving water can, that dirt drops to the bottom and builds up to make the water\nthere shallower and slower, and then keeps accumulating until the edge of the stream\nbecomes new land on the inside bank.        \nMeanwhile, the fast-moving water near the outside bank sweeps out of the curve with\nenough momentum to carry it across the channel and slam it into the other side, where it\nstarts to carve another curve . And then another, and then another, and then another. The wider\nthe stream, the longer it takes the slingshotting current to reach the other side, and the greater\nthe downstream distance to the next curve. In fact, measurements of meandering streams\nall over the world reveal a strikingly regular pattern : the length of one S-shaped meander\ntends to be about six times the width of the channel . So little tiny meandering streams\ntend to look just like miniature versions of their bigger relatives.\n     As long as nothing gets in the way of a river’s\nmeandering , its curves will continue to grow curvier and curvier until they loop around\nand bumble into themselves.

If it wasn't blinking, then you've had\nthe distinct pleasure of seeing one of mankind's greatest \ncollaborative feats with your own eyes: The International Space Station. Roughly the size of six-bedroom house,\nand weighing more than 320 cars, the International Space Station \nis so large that no single rocket could have \nlifted it into orbit. Instead, it was assembled piece by piece while hurtling through space\nat 28,000 kilometers per hour, lapping the Earth once every 90 minutes. It all started when sixteen nations signed the Space Station \nIntergovernmental Agreement, laying out each partner's \nexpected contributions to the ISS, from modules and maintenance\nto sharing information and finances. At an estimated 100 billion U.S. dollars, the Space Station would be\nthe most expensive object ever built. The whole world watched as a Russian rocket launched \nthe first module of the ISS into the sky. Zarya, meaning sunrise, \nwas equipped with two solar panels and a propulsion system \nthat had the important task of keeping the young station \nfrom crashing into the Earth by staying a safe 400 kilometers away. The U.S. Space Shuttle Endeavour\nfollowed two weeks later carrying Unity, a node module to which\nother modules could be connected, and an international \nsix-person assembly crew. Then came Zvezda, which brought\ncommunications and living accommodations. Ever since the International \nSpace Station's first tenants arrived, it's been continually occupied with more than 200 visitors spending \nan average of six months on board. Astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti \nholds the record for the longest single space flight\nby a woman at 199 days on the ISS. 2001 saw the arrival of Destiny,\nthe first of four research modules, where astronauts spend\napproximately 36 hours a week conducting extraordinary experiments\nin microgravity. Their schedules are packed with exercise, two hours a day to fend off \nmuscle atrophy, station maintenance and repair, and connecting with family \nor awe-inspired minds around the world. But they still find time for fun,\nwith regular movie nights and even shooting \nthe first music video in space. Destiny also controls the seven-jointed\nrobotic Canadarm2. Capable of moving \nmore than 100,000 kilograms, it's perfect for unloading \nnew arrivals from shuttles. 2001 was a busy year for the Space Station\nwith the addition of Quest, the main airlock for strolls outside, and Pirs, a pier for Russian \nspacecrafts to dock including the ever-ready \nemergency escape vehicle, Soyuz. Then, on February 1st, 2003, after delivering \nresearch modules to the ISS, the space shuttle\nColumbia exploded during reentry tragically killing \nthe seven-member crew on board. After a four-year hiatus, work quickly\npicked up pace with the addition of more hubs, \nairlocks, docks, and an observation cupola for stunning\n360-degree views of our world and beyond. Other critical components included \nplatforms and trusses to support radiators that direct all the heat generated\nby the station's electronics into space and solar panels that are efficient enough\nto power 55 homes. It took ten years and over 30 missions, but finally, the International \nSpace Station was complete, coinciding with the U.S. Space \nShuttle Program's retirement. The Space Station continues to serve\nas an incredible model for international collaboration. This year, two people \nbegan a one-year stay on the ISS, allowing scientists to study the long-term\nphysical and psychological effects of being in space, which would prove useful for increasingly\nambitious space travel, like trips to Mars. Over its lifetime, we've learned \nan immense amount scientifically, but also about \nour capacity to work together and accomplish truly remarkable acts."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long does it take the International Space Station to orbit the earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1.5 hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2 hours"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6 hours"}, {"label": "D", "text": "24 hours"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many people have ever been aboard the ISS over its lifetime?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "~50"}, {"label": "B", "text": "~100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "~150"}, {"label": "D", "text": "~200"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the name of the Russian escape spacecraft that is always docked at the ISS, in case of emergency?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Zarya"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Soyuz"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Zvezda"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pirs"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "About how big is the International Space Station?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Roughly the size of a 3-bedroom house"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Roughly the size of a 5-bedroom house"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Roughly the size of a 4-bedroom house"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Roughly the size of a 6-bedroom house"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Zarya was the first module of the ISS to be launched into space — what does the word \"Zarya\" mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sunset"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sunrise"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Star"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sky"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

A cataract occurs when proteins \nin the lens lose their normal arrangement, clumping together in a way that causes\ndiscoloration or clouding, and eventually blocks most vision. Cataracts can be caused by eye injury, certain medications, ultraviolet radiation, diabetes, smoking, or some genetic disorders. But the most common cause is aging. In the United States, more than 50%\nof people over the age of 80 develop them. Cataracts were treated \nover 2,500 years ago in India, though similar procedures \nmay have existed even earlier in Ancient Egypt and Babylon. The most common procedure,\ncalled couching, involved pressing \na sharp instrument into the eye to loosen and push \nthe clouded lens out of the way. Although this could increase \nthe amount of light entering the eye, the lack of a lens would leave \nthe patient's vision out of focus. Despite its low success rate,\nand high risk of infection or injury, couching is still performed \nin some parts of the world. Later procedures would also focus\non removing the cloudy lens, for example, by making an opening\nin the cornea to pull out the lens along with the membrane capsule \nsurrounding it. While the invention of eyeglasses\nallowed for some restoration of focus, they had to be extremely thick to help. Furthermore, such techniques\nstill caused complications, like damaging the retina, or leaving the eye \nwith uncomfortable stitches. But in the 20th century, \nsomething unexpected happened. Eye surgeon Sir Harold Ridley was treating\nWorld War II casualties when he noticed that acrylic plastic from\na shattered aircraft cockpit had become lodged in a pilot's eyes\nwithout triggering an adverse reaction. This led him to propose surgically\nimplanting artificial lenses into the eye to replace cataracts. And despite initial resistance, the method became standard practice\nby the 1980s. Since Ridley's discovery, the intraocular lens \nhas undergone several improvements. Modern lenses can fit \ninto the membrane capsule that the cataract is extracted from, leaving more of \nthe eye's natural anatomy intact. And the ability to fine-tune \nthe lens curvature allows the surgery to restore \na patient's normal vision without the need for glasses. Of course, surgical techniques \nhave also progressed. Microscopic procedures use \nsmall instruments or lasers to make precise incisions of one \nor two millimeters in the cornea, while an ultrasound probe breaks up\nand removes the cataracted lens with minimal trauma to the eye. Low-tech versions of this operation have\nmade the surgery quick and inexpensive, helping it spread \nacross the developing world. Places like Aravind Eye Hospital in India have pioneered high-volume, \nlow-cost cataract surgery for as little as six dollars. Why then, with all these advances, are there still so many \nblind people in the world? The main issue is access to health care, with poor infrastructure \nand a shortage of doctors being a major barrier in many regions. But this is not the only problem. In many rural areas with poor education, blindness is often accepted \nas an inevitable part of aging, for which someone \nmight not think to seek treatment. This is why information is crucial. Increased community awareness programs\nand the spread of mobile phones mean that many of those who might have remained blind for\nthe rest of their lives due to cataracts are now reachable. And for them, \na brighter future is in sight."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many people in the world are estimated to be blind from cataracts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "80,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20,000,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "39,000,000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What proportion of people worldwide is blind from causes termed \"avoidable\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "15%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "33%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "80%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Cataracts affect the _____ of the eye.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cornea"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Retina"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nerve"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Modern day treatment of cataracts involves:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eye drops"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tablets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eye surgery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Injections"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The most common risk factor for developing cataracts is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Injury"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Allergy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Age"}, {"label": "D", "text": "High blood pressure"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

{"page": 43, "lesson": 15, "title": "How memories form and how we lose them - Catharine Young", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-memories-form-and-how-we-lose-them-catharine-young", "transcript": {"en": "Think back to a really vivid memory. Got it? Okay, now try to remember what \nyou had for lunch three weeks ago. That second memory \nprobably isn't as strong, but why not? Why do we remember some things,\nand not others? And why do memories eventually fade? Let's look at how memories form\nin the first place. When you experience something,\nlike dialing a phone number, the experience is converted \ninto a pulse of electrical energy that zips along a network of neurons. Information first lands \nin short term memory, where it's available \nfrom anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of minutes. It's then transferred to long-term memory\nthrough areas such as the hippocampus, and finally to several storage regions\nacross the brain. Neurons throughout the brain\ncommunicate at dedicated sites called synapses using specialized neurotransmitters. If two neurons communicate repeatedly,\na remarkable thing happens: the efficiency of communication \nbetween them increases. This process, \ncalled long term potentiation, is considered to be a mechanism\nby which memories are stored long-term, but how do some memories get lost? Age is one factor. As we get older, \nsynapses begin to falter and weaken, affecting how easily \nwe can retrieve memories. Scientists have several theories about\nwhat's behind this deterioration, from actual brain shrinkage, the hippocampus \nloses 5% of its neurons every decade for a total loss of 20% by the time \nyou're 80 years old to the drop in the production \nof neurotransmitters, like acetylcholine,\nwhich is vital to learning and memory. These changes seem to affect how people\nretrieve stored information. Age also affects \nour memory-making abilities. Memories are encoded most strongly\nwhen we're paying attention, when we're deeply engaged,\nand when information is meaningful to us. Mental and physical health problems,\nwhich tend to increase as we age, interfere with our ability \nto pay attention, and thus act as memory thieves. Another leading cause of memory problems\nis chronic stress. When we're constantly overloaded with work\nand personal responsibilites, our bodies are on hyperalert. This response has evolved from\nthe physiological mechanism designed to make sure \nwe can survive in a crisis. Stress chemicals help mobilize energy\nand increase alertness. However, with chronic stress our bodies\nbecome flooded with these chemicals, resulting in a loss of brain cells\nand an inability to form new ones, which affects our ability \nto retain new information. Depression is another culprit. People who are depressed are 40%\nmore likely to develop memory problems. Low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter connected to arousal, may make depressed individuals \nless attentive to new information. Dwelling on sad events in the past,\nanother symptom of depression, makes it difficult to pay \nattention to the present, affecting the ability to store\nshort-term memories. Isolation, which is tied to depression,\nis another memory thief. A study by the Harvard School \nof Public Health found that older people \nwith high levels of social integration had a slower rate of memory decline\nover a six-year period. The exact reason remains unclear, but experts suspect that social interaction \ngives our brain a mental workout. Just like muscle strength, we have to use our brain\nor risk losing it. But don't despair. There are several steps you can take to aid your brain \nin preserving your memories. Make sure you keep physically active. Increased blood flow \nto the brain is helpful. And eat well. Your brain needs all the right nutrients\nto keep functioning correctly. And finally, give your brain a workout. Exposing your brain to challenges,\nlike learning a new language, is one of the best defenses for keeping\nyour memories intact."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Long term potentiation is a mechanism by which:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Memories are lost"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Memories are stored"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Memories are formed"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which two factors contribute to memory loss as we age:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brain shrinkage and extra neuronal connections"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Brain growth and a drop in neurotransmitter production"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Brain shrinkage and a drop in neurotransmitter production"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brain growth and extra neuronal connections"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "You look up a friends phone number, however when you call the number, the line is busy.

Just how did the world end up with this tiny\nnation? The short answer is: because Mussolini and\nthe long answer is fiendishly complicated so here's a simplified medium version: The popes used to rule a country called the\nPapal States that covered much of modern day Italy. It was during this 1,000+ year reign that\nthe Popes constructed St. Peter's Basilica the largest church in the world -- and also\nbuilt a wall around the base of a hill known as Vatican upon which St. Peter's Stood. But the Kingdom of Italy next door thought\nRome would be an awesome capital for their country and so conquered the Papal States. His nation destroyed the Pope hid behind the\nwalls of Vatican and conflictingly refused to acknowledge that the Kingdom of Italy existed,\nwhile simultaneously complaining about being a prisoner of the Kingdom of Italy -- which\naccording to him didn't exist. Rather than risk religious civil war by getting\nrid of the pope the Kingdom of Italy decided to wait him out assuming he'd eventually give\nup -- but religion is nothing if not obstinate -- and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 popes and sixty years\nlater nothing had changed. Which brings us to Benito Mussolini the then\nprime minister of Italy who was tired of listing to the Pope complain to Italian Catholics\nabout his self-imposed imprisonment so Mussolini thought he could score some political points\nby striking a deal which looked like this: 1) Italy gave the land of Vatican to the Pope. and… 2) Italy gave the Pope a bunch of apology\nmoney In return 1) The Pope acknowledged that Italy existed\nand and… 2) The Pope promised to remain neutral in\npolitics and wars. On the off chance that, you know, Mussolini\nthought this might be a thing. The deal was signed and a new country, Vatican\nCity was born. And today the tiny nation on a hill has all\nthe things you'd expect of a country: its own government that makes its own laws that\nare enforced by its own police, who put people who break them in its own jail. It also has its own bank and prints its own\nstamps and issues its own license plates, though only its citizens can drive within\nits borders presumably because of terrible, terrible parking -- and as the true mark of\nany self-respecting nation: it has its own top-level domain: .VA But, despite all these national trappings\nVatican City is not really like any other country. Hold on to your fancy hat, because it's about\nto get weird: To understand the Vatican: there are two people\nand two things that you need to know about: the famous pope, the incredibly confusing\nHoly See, The Country of Vatican City and along with that the almost completely unknown\nKing of Vatican City. But first the Pope: who gets a throne to sit\nupon and from which he acts as the Bishop for all the Catholics in Rome. Actually all Bishops in the Catholic Church\nget their own thrones but because the Bishop of Rome is also the Pope his thrown is special\nand has it's own special name: The Holy See. Every time a Pope dies or retires there is\na sort of game of thrones to see which of the bishops will next get to occupy the Holy\nSee. So while Popes come and go the throne is eternal. As such the name The Holy See not only refers\nto the throne but also all the rules that make the Catholic Church the Catholic Church. When Mussolini crafted that aforementioned\ndeal, technically he gave the land of Vatican City to The Holy See -- which, believe it\nor not, is a legal corporate person in international law. Basically every time you hear the words The\nHoly See think Catholic Church, Inc of which the Pope is the CEO. Now back to the King. The King of Vatican City has absolute, unchecked\npower within the country's borders and his presence makes Vatican City one of only six\nremanning absolute monarchies in the world, including Brunei, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia,\nand Swaziland. The King's absolute power is why Vatican City\ncan't join the European Union because only democracies are allowed. Through Vatican City does, strictly speaking,\nhave a legislative brach of government -- staffed by cardinals, appointed by the pope -- the\nKing of Vatican City can overrule their decisions and at any time for any reason. So why do you never hear about the King of\nVatican City? Because though King and Pope are two different\nroles, they just happen to be occupied by the same person at the same time -- which\nhas the funny consequence that, because the Pope is elected and the King is all-powerful\nbut they're the same guy it makes Vatican City the world's only elected, non-hereditary\nabsolute monarchy. It's this dual-role that makes untangling\nVatican City so difficult because the Pope, depending on the situation either acts as\nThe King of the country of Vatican City or the Pope of the Holy See. Got it? No? OK, here's an analogy: Imagine if a powerful international company,\nsay Grey Industries, had a CEO who convinced the United States to give one of its islands\nto the Company which then made the island into a new country -- Greytropolis -- with\nan absolute monarchy as its government and the law that the King of Greytropolis is,\nby definition, the CEO of Grey Industries. It's pretty obvious at that point that the\nCEO should move his corporate headquarters to the new nation -- so that the laws of the\ncountry can benefit the company and the company's global reach can benefit the country. As for the man in the middle sometimes it's\ngood to the the CEO and sometimes it's good to be the king. That is essentially Vatican City. But if you're still confused, don't worry\neven other countries can't keep it straight. For example the United Nations has The Holy\nSee the corporation as a member but not Vatican City the actual country. And The Holy See gives passports to Vatican\nCity citizens that other countries accept even though those passports come from a company,\nnot a country. And speaking of Vatican City citizens, they\nare perhaps the strangest consequence of the Pope's dual role as religious leader and monarch. While other countries mint new citizens with\nthe ever popular process of human reproduction Vatican City does not. No one in Vatican City is born a citizen -- and\nthat's not just because, within a rounding error, there are no female Vaticans. The only way to become a citizen is for the\nKing of Vatican City to appoint you as one. And the King only appoints you a citizen if\nyou work for the Pope -- who is also the King. And because the King is all-powerful your\ncitizenship is at his whim. If you quit your job for the Pope, the King\n-- who is also the pope -- will revoke your citizenship. These rules mean that Vatican City doesn't\nhave a real permanent population to speak of: there are only about 500 full citizens\n-- which is fewer people that live in single skyscrapers in many countries -- and all these\ncitizens work for The Holy See as either Cardinals or Diplomats or the Pope's bodyguards or other\nCatholic-related jobs. So it's best to think of Vatican City as a\nkind of Sovereign Corporate Headquarters that grants temporary citizenship to its managers\nrather than a real city-state like Singapore: which has a self-reproducing population of\ncitizens engaged in a variety of economic activities both of which Vatican City lacks. But in the end, the reason the world cares\nabout Vatican City is not because of the citizens within its walls but because of the billion\nmembers of its church outside those walls."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Vatican City was generously given to the Catholic Church from Italy after the Papal states were conquered.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the name of the throne the Pope sits on as Bishop of all Catholics in Rome?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Holy Seat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Holy Sea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Holy See"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Vatican City was generously given to the Catholic Church from Italy after the Papal states were conquered.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the name of the throne the Pope sits on as Bishop of all Catholics in Rome?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Holy Seat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Holy Sea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Holy See"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

It feels like hours have gone by,\nbut it's only been eleven minutes, and you wonder, \"Why am I torturing myself? This thing has got to be considered \na cruel and unusual punishment.\" Actually, that's exactly \nwhat it is, or was. You see, in the 1800s, treadmills were created \nto punish English prisoners. At the time, the English prison system\nwas abysmally bad. Execution and deportation\nwere often the punishments of choice, and those who were locked away\nfaced hours of solitude in filthy cells. So social movements led by\nreligious groups, philanthropies, and celebrities, like Charles Dickens, sought to change these dire conditions\nand help reform the prisoners. When their movement succeeded, entire prisons were remodeled\nand new forms of rehabilitation, such as the treadmill,\nwere introduced. Here's how the original version, invented in 1818 by English engineer \nSir William Cubitt, worked. Prisoners stepped on 24 spokes\nof a large paddle wheel. As the wheel turned, the prisoner was forced \nto keep stepping up or risk falling off, similar to modern stepper machines. Meanwhile, the rotation made gears\npump out water, crush grain, or power mills, which is where the name \n\"treadmill\" originated. These devices were seen as a fantastic\nway of whipping prisoners into shape, and that added benefit of powering mills helped to rebuild a British economy\ndecimated by the Napoleonic Wars. It was a win for all concerned,\nexcept the prisoners. It's estimated that, on average, prisoners spent six \nor so hours a day on treadmills, the equivalent of climbing\n5,000 to 14,000 feet. 14,000 feet is roughly \nMount Everest's halfway point. Imagine doing that five days a week\nwith little food. Cubitt's idea quickly spread\nacross the British Empire and America. Within a decade of its creation, over 50 English prisons \nboasted a treadmill, and America, a similar amount. Unsurprisingly, the exertion combined\nwith poor nutrition saw many prisoners suffer breakdowns\nand injuries, not that prison guards seemed to care. In 1824, New York prison guard\nJames Hardie credited the device with taming his more \nboisterous inmates, writing that the \"monotonous steadiness, and not \nits severity...constitutes its terror,\" a quote many still agree with. And treadmills lasted in England\nuntil the late 19th century, when they were banned for being\nexcessively cruel under the Prison's Act of 1898. But of course the torture device\nreturned with a vengeance, this time targeting \nthe unsuspecting public. In 1911, a treadmill patent \nwas registered in the U.S., and by 1952, the forerunner for \ntoday's modern treadmill had been created. When the jogging craze \nhit the U.S. in the 1970s, the treadmill was thrust \nback into the limelight as an easy and convenient \nway to improve aerobic fitness, and lose unwanted pounds, which, to be fair, \nit's pretty good at doing. And the machine \nhas maintained its popularity since. So the next time you voluntarily subject\nyourself to what was once a cruel and unusual punishment, just be glad you can control\nwhen you'll hop off."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When were treadmills invented?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1911"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1952"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1818"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1898"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who invented the treadmill?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sir William Cubitt"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Charles Dickens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lord Albert Sherryton"}, {"label": "D", "text": "James Hardie"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the treadmill's original purpose?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exercise"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To power mills"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To crush grain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To punish English criminals"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What was the average time spent on a treadmill?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "8 Hours"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4 Hours"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3 Hours"}, {"label": "D", "text": "6 Hours"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When was the treadmill first patented in the United States?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1911"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1970"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1952"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Multiply that by your body's\nhundred trillion or so cells, and you've got a quintillion \nDNA errors everyday. And because DNA provides the blueprint for the proteins \nyour cells need to function, damage causes serious problems,\nsuch as cancer. The errors come in different forms. Sometimes nucleotides, \nDNA's building blocks, get damaged, other times nucleotides \nget matched up incorrectly, causing mutations, and nicks in one or both strands\ncan interfere with DNA replication, or even cause sections \nof DNA to get mixed up. Fortunately, your cells have ways\nof fixing most of these problems most of the time. These repair pathways \nall rely on specialized enzymes. Different ones respond \nto different types of damage. One common error is base mismatches. Each nucleotide contains a base, and during DNA replication, the enzyme DNA polymerase\nis supposed to bring in the right partner to pair with every base \non each template strand. Adenine with thymine,\nand guanine with cytosine. But about once every \nhundred thousand additions, it makes a mistake. The enzyme catches \nmost of these right away, and cuts off a few nucleotides\nand replaces them with the correct ones. And just in case it missed a few, a second set of proteins \ncomes behind it to check. If they find a mismatch, they cut out the incorrect nucleotide\nand replace it. This is called mismatch repair. Together, these two systems reduce\nthe number of base mismatch errors to about one in one billion. But DNA can get damaged\nafter replication, too. Lots of different molecules\ncan cause chemical changes to nucleotides. Some of these come \nfrom environmental exposure, like certain compounds in tobacco smoke. But others are molecules that are found\nin cells naturally, like hydrogen peroxide. Certain chemical changes are so common that they have specific enzymes assigned\nto reverse the damage. But the cell also has more general\nrepair pathways. If just one base is damaged, it can usually be fixed by a process\ncalled base excision repair. One enzyme snips out the damaged base, and other enzymes come in to trim around\nthe site and replace the nucleotides. UV light can cause damage \nthat's a little harder to fix. Sometimes, it causes two adjacent\nnucleotides to stick together, distorting the DNA's double helix shape. Damage like this requires \na more complex process called nucleotide excision repair. A team of proteins removes a long strand\nof 24 or so nucleotides, and replaces them with fresh ones. Very high frequency radiation,\nlike gamma rays and x-rays, cause a different kind of damage. They can actually sever one \nor both strands of the DNA backbone. Double strand breaks\nare the most dangerous. Even one can cause cell death. The two most common pathways\nfor repairing double strand breaks are called homologous recombination\nand non-homologous end joining. Homologous recombination uses an undamaged\nsection of similar DNA as a template. Enzymes interlace the damaged\nand undamgaed strands, get them to exchange sequences\nof nucleotides, and finally fill in the missing gaps to end up with two complete\ndouble-stranded segments. Non-homologous end joining,\non the other hand, doesn't rely on a template. Instead, a series of proteins\ntrims off a few nucleotides and then fuses the broken ends \nback together. This process isn't as accurate. It can cause genes to get mixed up,\nor moved around. But it's useful when \nsister DNA isn't available. Of course, changes to DNA \naren't always bad. Beneficial mutations \ncan allow a species to evolve. But most of the time, \nwe want DNA to stay the same. Defects in DNA repair are associated\nwith premature aging and many kinds of cancer. So if you're looking for \na fountain of youth, it's already operating in your cells, billions and billions of times a day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Base mismatch is due to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Substitution of a base with another one"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Incorrect pairing of bases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nucleotides damage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The cut of a few nucleotides"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Base mismatches take place:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "During DNA replication"}, {"label": "B", "text": "After DNA replication"}, {"label": "C", "text": "During transcription"}, {"label": "D", "text": "During interphase"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Tobacco smoke can cause:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Single strand breaks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Double strand breaks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chemical changes to nucleotides"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Homologous recombination"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "For homologous recombination to occur:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cell needs a similar copy of damaged DNA"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Broken ends are fused together"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Base excision repair takes place"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The cell must duplicate"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which DNA repair pathway deals with DNA damage that causes distortion of double-stranded helix?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Base excision repair"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nucleotide excision repair"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mismatch repair"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Non-homologous end joining"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Indian mathematicians called it \nthe Staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. To much of the Western world,\nit's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair\nsince he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. So what is it about this that has so \nintrigued mathematicians the world over? In short, \nit's full of patterns and secrets. First and foremost, there's the pattern\nthat generates it. Start with one and imagine invisible\nzeros on either side of it. Add them together in pairs, \nand you'll generate the next row. Now, do that again and again. Keep going and you'll wind up \nwith something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle \ngoes on infinitely. Now, each row corresponds to what's called\nthe coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). The coefficients, \nor numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row\nof Pascal's Triangle. You'll see the same thing with n=3,\nwhich expands to this. So the triangle is a quick and easy way\nto look up all of these coefficients. But there's much more. For example, add up \nthe numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. Or in a given row, treat each number\nas part of a decimal expansion. In other words, row two is\n(1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). You get 121, which is 11^2. And take a look at what happens\nwhen you do the same thing to row six. It adds up to 1,771,561,\nwhich is 11^6, and so on. There are also geometric applications. Look at the diagonals. The first two aren't very interesting:\nall ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. But the numbers in the next diagonal\nare called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them \ninto equilateral triangles. The next diagonal \nhas the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack\nthat many spheres into tetrahedra. Or how about this:\nshade in all of the odd numbers. It doesn't look like much\nwhen the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal \nknown as Sierpinski's Triangle. This triangle isn't just \na mathematical work of art. It's also quite useful, especially when it comes \nto probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family \nof three girls and two boys. In the binomial expansion, that corresponds \nto girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number \ncorresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number \nis what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum \nof all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly \npicking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups \nof five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would\nbe phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth \nelement of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer.

That's a classic case \nof a misplaced modifier, a common grammatical mistake that can dramatically change \nthe meaning of a sentence. And lest you think \nthis is a bit far-fetched, confusing headlines like this\nappear all the time. Modifiers are words, phrases, and clauses that add information \nabout other parts of a sentence, which is usually helpful. But when modifiers\naren't linked clearly enough to the words \nthey're actually referring to, they can create unintentional ambiguity. That happens because the modifying words, in this case, \n\"with world's largest chocolate bunny,\" modify the wrong thing,\nthe robber's actions instead of the town. To correct this particular sentence,\nwe simply rephrase to make it clearer what the modifying \nphrase is talking about. \"Town with world's largest chocolate bunny\nrobbed by thief.\" Now, at least it's clear that the thief wasn't armed \nwith a giant chocolate animal. Sometimes, modifying words, \nphrases, or clauses don't appear to be modifying \nanything at all. That's called a dangling modifier. \"Having robbed the bank in record time, it was possible to make off \nwith the town's chocolate rabbit as well.\" The modifying phrase in this sentence\nseems unrelated to anything else, and so we're clueless about who the chocolate-loving criminal \ncould possibly be. Giving the modifier something to modify\nwill solve the problem. Then there's another group\ncalled the squinting modifiers because they're stuck between two things\nand could feasibly refer to either. Often, these modifiers are adverbs,\nlike the one in this sentence: \"Robbers who steal chocolate bunnies\nrapidly attract the outrage of onlookers.\" \"Rapidly\" is the modifier, here,\nbut what's not clear is whether it's referring \nto the speed of the chocolate thievery, or how quickly it alerts \nthe furious onlookers. To clarify, we can either put the modifier\ncloser to its intended phrase, which works in some cases, or we can entirely reword the sentence\nso that the modifier no longer squints, but clearly applies to only one part. \"Chocolate bunny-thieving robbers\nrapidly attract the outrage of onlookers.\" Justice will eventually come \nto the chocolate thief, but in the meantime, our task is to avoid verbal ambiguity by making it clear which parts \nof the sentences modifiers belong to. That way, we can at least maintain\ngrammatical law and order."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is a modifier?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A very confusing phrase"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A word, phrase, or clause that adds in extra information about another part of the sentence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A grammatical mistake"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A misleading sentence"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What's the main problem with using modifiers incorrectly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They confuse verbs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They make no sense at all"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can completely change the meaning of a sentence and create ambiguity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They change the order of words in a sentence"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Under what circumstances do modifiers create a problem in a sentence?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When they modify the wrong thing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When they're at the beginning of the sentence instead of at the end"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When they're at the end of the sentence instead of at the beginning"}, {"label": "D", "text": "When they're too long"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "'Squinting' modifiers most often take the form of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Adverbs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Verbs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nouns"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Adjectives"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Modifiers are always wrong; there's no correct way to use them.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
