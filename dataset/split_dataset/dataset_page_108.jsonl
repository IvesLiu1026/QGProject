Each had their chosen place in court, but the youngest princess\nhad a special skill. She could pluck clouds from the sky\nand spin them into the softest robes. Her work was so precise, not even the most expert eye\ncould find a seam. But her craft was the same day after day,\nand she longed for new inspiration. Finally, the Queen Mother granted \nthe weaver permission to visit Earth. The other princesses would accompany her to protect their sister \nfrom earthly dangers. Dressed in special robes that allowed them\nto fly between Heaven and Earth, the sisters soared down from the sky. The weaver was in awe \nof the rolling hills and rivers, and the sisters decided to swim\nin one of the glittering streams. As the weaver floated,\nshe dreamt about staying forever. Meanwhile, a lone cowherd\napproached the riverbank. He came here often\nto sweep his parent’s grave and speak with his only companion— a stoic bull who listened patiently \nto the cowherd’s sorrows. But upon seeing the weaver’s beauty,\nthe cowherd forgot his routine. While he longed to introduce himself,\nhis lonely lifestyle had made him timid. Thankfully, the bull saw his friend's\nplight and offered some advice. He told the cowherd of the swimmer’s \ncelestial origins and of her dream to stay on Earth; but also that she could only remain \nif she lost her ticket back to Heaven. As the cowherd approached,\nthe princesses flew away in fear— leaving their dreaming sister behind. While keeping her magic robes hidden, the cowherd offered his own garment \nas a substitute. And after gaining her trust, \nthe pair began exploring the countryside. She was struck by his caring nature, and he learned to see \nthe world’s wonder through her eyes. Before long, the two had\nfallen deeply in love. The weaver and the cowherd\nbuilt a prosperous life. Their farm flourished, and the weaver \ntaught her skills to local villagers. As time marched on, the pair was \nblessed with two healthy children, but their bull was growing old. Before he died, the bull implored\nthe family to keep his hide and use its magic at their time of need. While the husband grieved for his friend, the weaver’s mind turned\nto her other family. Dusting off her magical robe,\nshe decided to pay a visit to the heavens. But when the weaver\nswept into her old home, no one seemed surprised to see her. With a start, she realized\nthat barely any time had passed— for a year on Earth\nwas merely a day in Heaven. When her family learned of her new life,\nthey were enraged. How dare she waste her love on a human? The weaver tried to escape back to Earth, but the Queen Mother plucked \na golden hairpin from her head and tore through the sky. A great gulf opened, forming a river\nof stars between Heaven and Earth. Below, the cowherd trembled, but he also\nremembered the bull’s final words. Hastily placing each child in a basket, he draped the bull’s pelt\nover his back and hurtled upwards. Above the clouds, each lover attempted\nto wade through the surging stars. But no matter how hard they struggled, the gulf between them\nonly grew wider. Day after day, the Queen Mother\nwatched without pity. Years passed, and the weaver \nand the cowherd had no one, except the passing magpies \nto cheer them on. Finally, their love moved\nthe Queen Mother’s heart. While she couldn’t forgive\nher granddaughter entirely, the Queen Mother would allow the weaver\nto meet her earthly family once a year. And so, in late summer, the magpies\nform a bridge across the Milky Way, reuniting the weaver and the cowherd.

But the desiccated corpses \nof prominent natural numbers— whole numbers greater than 0— have been showing up all over the city\nfor the past week. All of Digitopolis is on lockdown\nfrom sundown to sunrise, and it’s still not enough to stop\nwhat can only be described as a vampiric feeding frenzy. The police are helpless, \nand have turned to you. You put the missing persons case \nyou’ve been investigating on hold and study the evidence. Here’s what you know: most victims have been completely\ndrained of their life’s essence. Some have a thin line of slime\nseparating digits— some of which were drained \nand others spared. Which leads you to mystery one: what’s the significance \nof the slime-lines, and why are certain digits untouched? Pause here to figure it out yourself. \nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s start by looking \nfor a pattern in the victims. Why have some been fully drained,\nand some slimed? Well, the slime-lined are in their prime— which is to say they’re prime numbers,\ndivisible only by 1 and themselves. Not a single one of the unslimed numbers,\non the other hand, is. Furthermore, the drained parts of the \nslimed primes are not, themselves, prime. When 71 got slimed, 7 was prime,\nbut 1 was not. If 461 had been split into 4 and 61,\nthe right side would have been prime, but instead it was split further\ninto non-prime digits. And when 2099 got slimed, \nthe attacker went with 20 and 99, and was able to drain both. So you have a big problem. There are infinite potential victims: all non-prime numbers, and all prime numbers that can \nbe slime-lined to reveal at least one non-prime number. In fact, you can only think of a few\nnumbers that aren't vulnerable. First of all, the one digit primes: \n2, 3, 5, and 7. Then primes like 23, which could only be\nsplit into 2 and 3, both prime. These numbers are familiar, but why? Aha! Your missing person’s case. Someone is kidnapping the numbers\nthat can’t be drained: we’ll call them the immune. If you can identify the four immune \nwho remain, perhaps you can get to them first\nand figure out what’s going on. Who are the immune?\nPause here to figure it out yourself. Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are 4 one-digit immune:\n2, 3, 5, and 7. All have already been kidnapped. But every digit in all of the immune\nmust be one of those four numbers; otherwise there would be \na non-prime split possible. That means there are only these 16\ncandidates among the two-digit numbers. The ones that are prime must be immune. We can eliminate anything \nthat ends in 2 or 5, as they’ll always be divisible by 2 and 5. This diagonal is also out,\nas they’re divisible by 11. If the digits of a number add\nup to a multiple of 3, it’s divisible by 3. So that eliminates 57 and 27,\nleaving these numbers. Which, upon double-checking, are, \nin fact, immune. We now have a strong starting point\nfor searching three-digit numbers: any 2 consecutive digits must be \non the list of the two-digit immune. Those all end in 3 and 7, so the only possibilities\nare these 8 options: the two-digit immune with additional\n3s or 7s on their ends. 3 can’t follow 3,\nnor 7 follow 7. And once again, adding the digits \nreveals that 237 and 537 are divisible by 3. 737 is 67 times 11, \nso that leaves just 373, which is, in fact, prime,\nand therefore immune. Could a four-digit number be immune? No, any consecutive three digits\nwould have to be immune, and there’s no immune three digit\nnumber that starts with a 7. You rush out, \nbut reach each home too late, until the only immune left is 373. You’re in the nick of time to scare\noff her would-be kidnapper; not the vampire itself but a minion. 373 explains that she and the other immune\nare the subjects of an ancient prophecy that designated them as vampire slayers. They’d sometimes gather and try \nto figure out what a vampire is, but no one had the slightest idea. They found the idea of slaying\nthings quite distasteful. You both trail her would-be kidnapper\nback to a foreboding castle. There you release the other \nkidnapped numbers and confront the vampire himself. He’s powerless before the slayers, \nbut ever the pacifists, they round him up, return the lifeforce \nto his victims, and send him packing.

But from poison traps \nto hastily brandished slippers, cockroaches seem to weather \njust about everything we throw at them. So what makes cockroaches so hard to kill? There are nearly 5,000 cockroach species. 99% of them live in a range of habitats\nwhere they play important ecological roles by recycling dead or decaying \norganic matter and nourishing other animals. But a couple dozen species adapted to live\nin close association with humans. German and American cockroaches\nare among the most common. And they owe their resilience\nto a combination of physical and chemical adaptations. When it comes to old-fashioned \nremoval methods, they're troublingly tenacious. An American cockroach’s sensory hairs \nor structures pick up subtle air currents and rapidly send signals \nto its central nervous system. The roach can then turn and sprint\naway within a few milliseconds. And it’s among the fastest invertebrates\never recorded, reaching speeds of up to 50\nbody lengths per second. This would be the human equivalent of\nrunning more than 300 kilometers per hour. And finding a hiding place is no problem. With its flattened, flexible body, an American cockroach can squeeze into \nspaces less than a quarter of its height. Even if we do land a hit, \nit can withstand compressive forces of up to 900 times its own weight \nby distributing the impact along its body. And the cockroach’s toughness\ndoesn’t end there. Cockroaches can eat a variety \nof organic matter, including hair, dead skin, \nadhesives, and paper. This is made possible by an expansive set \nof digestive enzymes. Cockroaches are able to thrive \neven in nutrient-poor environments. Roaches often eat decaying foods\nthat are low in nitrogen— an essential component\nof DNA and proteins. But they survive by storing \nnitrogen-containing wastes in their bodies and having a resident group\nof bacteria recycle the nitrogen into useful molecules for them. Meanwhile, German cockroaches\nwill eat their own poop, vomit, and dead or dying colony members \nwithout hesitation. An American cockroach will\nfrolic in sewers, consuming excrement and toting microbes\nlike Staphylococcus aureus and E.coli. But they’ll rarely suffer\nany consequences. This is because they’re equipped \nwith genes that provide immunity against numerous pathogens. These genes are often duplicated \nmany times over. So when infected, the cockroach’s \nimmune system efficiently unleashes many antimicrobial molecules. Cockroaches also have a slew of defenses\nagainst pesticides. When a non-resistant roach walks \non a surface that’s been sprayed with a pyrethroid insecticide, \nfor example, the results will likely be fatal. Once absorbed, the chemical binds\nto sodium channel proteins, which help propagate nerve impulses. The pyrethroid keeps \nthe sodium channels open, so the nerves fire repeatedly. And soon, the cockroach dies. But if a resistant roach is exposed \nto pyrethroids, it’ll be just fine. Genetic mutations have given\nthem sodium channels that the pyrethroids can’t bind to. The cockroach also produces more\ndetoxification enzymes, which render the pesticide harmless, and the cockroach simply excretes \nit as a waste. Because German cockroaches\nreproduce especially quickly, populations may evolve resistance \nto a new pesticide within months. So far, they're already resistant\nto 43 different chemicals. But contrary to popular belief, cockroaches would probably not survive \na nuclear apocalypse. Compared with other insects, cockroaches are only mildly\ntolerant to radiation. They would die near the sites\nof nuclear explosions and would still be severely\ncompromised miles away. Moreover, disasters that threaten humanity also jeopardize the habitats and buffets \nwe provide roaches. Perhaps the only way to beat them \nis through our mutual destruction. Or maybe cockroaches would find \neven more surprising ways to thrive long after we’re gone."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which factors do cockroaches owe their resilience to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Physical and chemical adaptations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Environmental factors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Psychiatric factors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The ability of pest cockroaches such as the American cockroach to escape stomping attempts by humans can be attributed to which of the following characteristics.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Walking or running speed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Flattened and flexible body"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both “a” and “b”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which word or term best describes the dietary preference of pest cockroaches such as the German and American cockroach?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vegetarian"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Carnivorous"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Omnivorous"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eggetarian"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which mechanisms allow cockroaches (particularly German cockroaches) to tolerate and survive pesticide exposure?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Detoxification enzymes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mutations in the target site proteins"}, {"label": "C", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In comparison to some other insects such as certain fruit flies and flour beetles, how can the tolerance of cockroaches to radiation be described?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Highly tolerant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Susceptible"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mildly tolerant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Immune or completely tolerant"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

On Earth, each morsel of food \nwas sweet sustenance, while in the land of the dead,\nit ensured a permanent stay. Demeter tended to Earth’s fields \nwith her beloved daughter, Persephone, who inherited her mother’s passions\nand grew into a bright young woman. But all the while, a shadowy figure\nwatched from below. One day, Persephone was frolicking\nin a meadow with a freshwater nymph, Cyane. As they admired a blooming\nnarcissus flower, they noticed it tremble in the ground. Suddenly, the earth split, \nand a terrifying figure arose. It was Hades, god of the dead\nand the underworld. He wrenched Persephone from Cyane,\ndragged her into his inky chariot, and blasted back through the earth. Cyane wept so hard she dissolved,\nbecoming one with the river. By the time Demeter arrived \nat the scene of the abduction, the crater in the meadow had closed—\nand Cyane and Persephone had vanished. Demeter sped to Mount Olympus for help. Many of the gods had witnessed the scene. And they knew about the deal \nthat paved the way for it: Zeus, Persephone’s father, \nhad granted Hades her hand in marriage without her consent— or Demeter’s. But when faced with Demeter’s pleas, \nthe other gods stayed silent, So, she searched alone. In her grief and desperation, \nshe neglected her usual tasks. Crops withered, and a great famine \nplagued the Earth. As mortals began to perish, \nthe gods grew wary. Who would worship them and \noffer tributes if the humans disappeared? So, Zeus ordered Demeter to stop \nher crusade and returned to her duties. But she refused. Deep below, across the frigid river Styx,\nand through the halls of the underworld, Persephone was waging her own protest. Hades expected her to serve\nas his wife and queen. But Persephone rebuffed the god’s advances\nand refused food. As she longed for her mother’s company, her friends’ laughter,\nand the sun’s warmth, Persephone grew colder and lonelier. And she was starving. She hungered for satisfying grains,\ncrisp vegetables and fresh fruit. Wandering the ghostly gardens, she contemplated the pomegranates \nthat hung heavily on their branches... Meanwhile, Demeter continued her hunt. She appealed to the all-seeing sun god,\nHelios, whose rays had long warmed her crops. Indeed, when Helios drew his golden\nchariot across the sky that fateful day, he saw what happened— \nand he knew of the deal. Out of respect and sympathy for Demeter, Helios told her of Hades’ demands,\nZeus’ betrayal and Persephone’s abduction. Furious and heartbroken, Demeter sped\nto Mount Olympus and confronted Zeus, demanding their daughter’s return. But Zeus declined: in her ravenous hunger, Persephone had eaten a few seeds from the \npomegranate that grew in the underworld. Though a meager amount, it was enough\nto ensnare her in Hades forever. Demeter wouldn't accept this fate. She swore that if she wasn’t\nreunited with Persephone, the fields would never be fertile again, and the distinction between the Earth \nand the underworld would soon dissolve. So, they made a pact. For two thirds of every year, Persephone \nwould return to the land of the living, But for the remainder, she would stay \nin the world of the dead. When Persephone ascended to Earth,\nshe and her mother rejoiced. Together, they showered the fields \nwith rain and nurtured them with sun. For mortals, Persephone’s arrival came\nto herald the start of spring. But her descent always came too soon. Each time she returned to Hades, \nDemeter mourned, and the earth grew cold, \ndark, and unyielding, ushering in the winter months. Knowing Demeter couldn’t be roused \nfrom her grief, the humans stored their crops, \nstoked their fires, and awaited Persephone’s safe return.

The police have just arrived \nto arrest your spouse— for murder. This accusation comes as a total shock. In your experience, your partner has\nalways been gentle and loving, and you can't imagine them committing\na grisly murder. But the evidence is serious: their fingerprints were found\non the murder weapon. Your spouse insists they're innocent. “I know it looks bad,” they say,\n“but you have to believe me! If you don’t, who will?” Should you believe your spouse, even though the evidence \nagainst them looks damning? Take a second to think what you would\nbelieve in this situation. This dilemma is part of what philosophers\ncall the ethics of belief: a field of study that explores \nhow we ought to form beliefs, and whether we have ethical duties\nto believe certain things. The question here isn't about\nwhat you should do, such as whether or not you should find\nyour spouse guilty in a court of law. After all, you wouldn’t be on the jury\nin their trial! Rather, it’s about what you should believe\nto be true. So, what factors should you consider? Perhaps the most obvious is your evidence. After all, to believe something\nis to take it to be true. And evidence is, by definition, all information that helps\nus determine what's true. From this, some philosophers draw\nthe conclusion that evidence is the only thing that ought \nto determine what you believe. This view is called evidentialism,\nand a strict evidentialist would say it doesn’t matter that the accused \nis your spouse. You should evaluate the evidence \nfrom a neutral, objective point of view. Taking the perspective \nof an unbiased third party, your judgment of your spouse's character\nis a relevant consideration. But finding their fingerprints \nat the crime scene is surely stronger evidence. So, from an evidentialist point of view, you should either believe \nyour spouse is guilty, or at best remain undecided. Some philosophers present\nevidentialism only as a view of what’s most rational to believe. But others, like 19th century \nevidentialist W.K. Clifford, think that following the evidence\nis also morally required. One argument for this view is that \nhaving well-informed, accurate beliefs is often vitally important to determining \nthe ethical way to act. Another argument is that there’s something\nunethical about being dishonest, and refusing to follow the evidence is \na way of being dishonest with oneself. However, perhaps there are other\nethical factors in play. Although the evidence against\nyour spouse is strong, there’s still a chance that\nthey’re actually innocent. Think for a moment about how \nit would feel to be innocent, and have no one believe you—\nnot even your own partner! By not trusting your spouse, you run the risk of seriously hurting\nthem in their crucial hour of need. Moreover, consider what this lack \nof trust would do to your marriage. It would be incredibly difficult \nto continue a loving relationship with someone that you believed—\nor even strongly suspected— was a murderer. You might try to pretend to believe\nthat your spouse is innocent, but could you really \ngo on living that lie? According to a theory of the ethics \nof belief called pragmatism, these kinds of practical considerations\ncan sometimes make it right to believe something\neven without strong evidence. Some pragmatists would even say \nthat you morally owe it to your spouse to believe them. But is it even possible to believe\nyour spouse is innocent just because you think it’ll be good\nfor your relationship? Or because you think you owe\nit to the accused? You might desperately want \nto believe they’re innocent, but can you control your beliefs in the\nsame way you control your actions? It seems like you can’t just believe\nwhatever you like when the truth is staring you in the face. But on the other hand, \nrecall your spouse’s plea. When we say things like this, we seem to be assuming that it is possible\nto control our beliefs in some way. So what do you think? \nCan you control what beliefs you have?

That’s why we’re here, \nto take you on a world tour of some of nature’s most incredible snakes\nfrom the safety of your home— and with your very own intrepid guide. All the snakes we’ll be visiting\nbelong to a group called the vipers. As of 2021, there are 368 species\nof viper worldwide.

Unlike most snakes, which lay eggs, most vipers have eggs \nthat hatch inside the mother, who then gives birth \nto up to dozens of tiny snakes. Not glad you’re safe at home yet? Vipers are also often highly venomous, with two hollow fangs that fold flat\nto the roofs of their mouths. This allows the fangs to be extra long, unfolding into imposing weapons\nwhen the viper prepares to strike. So how about we pay them a surprise visit?

Rattlesnakes can shake their rattles\nup to 90 times per second to warn off predators \nfor hours if needed. The rattle consists of hollow, interlocked\nsegments made of keratin, the same substance that makes\nour nails and hair. When the snake shakes its tail,\nthese segments hit each other, creating a shockingly loud noise. Now onto the mountains of western Iran,\nwhere a spider crawls across a rock, making easy prey for a passing bird—\nor not. The spider-tailed horned viper is\nperfectly camouflaged, almost invisible, except for its unique bulbous tail-tip\nwith long drooping scales that look like a leggy spider. Spider-tailed vipers\nare only about 50 centimeters long, so they can lure small birds \nwithin striking range without compromising their ability \nto squeeze into narrow rock crevices. In the rainforests of Latin America \nlives a viper that couldn’t be more different\nfrom the spider-tailed viper— if you can find it. It’s one of the most elusive snakes\nin the world: the bushmaster. The bushmaster is a pit viper. Between each eye and nostril,\nit has a heat-sensing pit with a membrane covered \nin highly sensitive receptors that respond to temperature changes as small as one one-thousandth \nof a degree Celsius. These pits gather infrared information\nthat is integrated with visual information in the optic tectum. This allows the bushmaster to “see” \nthe heat signature of approaching prey or predators, helping it decide whether or not to strike\nand strike more accurately. This comes in handy for guarding a nest— unlike most other vipers, \nthe bushmaster lays eggs in hollowed out tree buttresses \nor burrows made by other animals. It must be large enough\nto defend its nest— in fact, the bushmaster is the\nlargest viper in the world, reaching lengths of over 11 feet,\nwith huge fangs and deadly venom. Meanwhile, in the forests \nof sub-Saharan Africa, there’s a shorter, chunkier viper that’s \neven more venomous than the bushmaster. The African Gaboon viper has \nthe longest fangs of any snake— yes, all 3,879 snake species, \nnot just vipers— and can deliver 1,000 milligrams\nof venom in a single bite— enough to kill ten adult humans. Although deadly, Gaboon vipers \nhave a reputation for being slow-moving \nand placid creatures. When they do strike, they hold onto their \nrodent prey while the venom takes effect, then quickly swallow it down. At this point, you may be worrying\nabout our guide— but never fear, rodents like our little desert \nkangaroo rat have their own skills to evade the serpent’s tooth. They stomp their feet at rattlesnakes,\nkick sand towards them, and evade their strikes \nwith acrobatic leaps and powerful kicks— helping them live to guide \nanother snake tour."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many viper species are there in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "~18"}, {"label": "B", "text": "~68"}, {"label": "C", "text": "~368"}, {"label": "D", "text": "~680"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does viviparity mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Strongly and brightly colored."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gives birth to live young."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lays eggs."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only gives birth to twins."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the longest viper in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "South American Bushmaster."}, {"label": "B", "text": "African Gaboon viper."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Iranian spider-tailed viper."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eastern diamondback rattlesnake"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Roughly how many snake species are there in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1650"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3879"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5090"}, {"label": "D", "text": "15687"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What do you find inside the rattle of a rattlesnake?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sand grains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "balls of keratin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "beads of old skin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "nothing, its hollow"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

On the unforgiving steppe,\nhe rose from a lowly sheep thief to become one of history’s \ngreatest conquerors, uniting nearly all of Central Asia, \nAfghanistan, and Iran under his rule. But was he a great state builder \nor a bloodthirsty tyrant? Order! Order! \nWho do we have on the stand today? Tamer...lane? That wasn’t his name, your Honor. The great Timur— meaning iron—\nwas nicknamed “Timur the lame” by enemies who mocked permanent \ninjuries to his leg and arm. Injuries he sustained raiding\na rival tribe’s sheep herd— he was a thief and a scoundrel\nfrom the start! Maybe— we actually don’t know for sure—\nbut even if that’s true, raiding rivals was just part \nof nomadic life at the time. Timur was not born into a ruling family, so he had to prove his worth \nthrough daring and horsemanship. He was hardly a commoner. Timur’s family was minor nobility. His uncle and brother-in-law were\nhigh-ranking officials. And when they trusted Timur\non a diplomatic mission, he defected to a rival khan! Strategic maneuvering! He reconciled with his uncle \nand brother-in-law soon after. Only for long enough to consolidate\nhis own power. Then he went to battle against\nhis brother-in-law— supposedly his closest ally. He was assassinated,\nand Timur seized power! They may have been friends, but he was a corrupt man \nwho alienated a lot of people. Timur was right to oust him. Afterward, he managed to reunite \nmost of the khanate’s territories and put an end to decades \nof bloody infighting. Okay, so where are we?\nI can hardly keep up. 1370, your honor. And he’s khan now? Well, not quite. Timur was not a direct descendant \nof Genghis Khan, so he couldn’t claim the title. Instead, he appointed figurehead khans\nand referred to himself as amir, or commander, \nand later as güregen, or son-in-law, after he married a woman who was \ndescended from Genghis Khan. He claimed to be a divinely ordained\nprotector of the Mongol and Muslim worlds, yet he undermined both \nMongol and Muslim power by relentlessly waging\nwar against his neighbors, weakening them so much that Christian\nEurope romanticized him as an ally. His campaigns killed as many \nas 17 million people! Propaganda. Timur’s official biographies deliberately \nexaggerated the number of deaths to deter rebellions. Like the Mongols, Timur offered\ncities the chance to surrender and only ordered massacres\nif they revolted. He rebuilt irrigation canals\nto support agriculture, and regularly distributed\nfood to the poor. Just in his hometown of Kesh, he paid for the meat of 20 sheep \nto be given to the poor every day. His campaigns were brutal, but by unifying Central Asia,\nAfghanistan, and Iran, he was also able to reinvigorate\nthe Silk Road. Much of Eurasia benefited from the revival\nof long-distance trade, and Central Asian cities,\nsuch as Samarkand and Herat, became thriving commercial hubs\nunder his rule. And meanwhile, other cities \nlike Baghdad, Aleppo, and Delhi were plundered and burned\nand took decades to recover. This illiterate warlord destroyed\ncenturies’ worth of cultural heritage, leaving nothing but pyramids\nof skulls in his wake. Timur may have been illiterate, but he was also an active patron\nof culture and the arts. During his conquests, \nhe spared artisans and scholars, sending them to work on public projects\nlike schools and mosques. Unlike many women in the world\nat the time, his wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law were highly educated \nand politically active. Timur also personally met with—\nand impressed— the famed Arab historian \nIbn Khaldun in Damascus, and he so thoroughly mastered chess\nthat he is said to have enjoyed a more complex variant \nthat was named for him. So what happened after that? Timur died from an illness in 1405,\nwhen he was likely in his early 70s. The empire he founded lasted \nanother hundred years, ushering in an architectural, artistic,\nliterary and scientific renaissance across Central Asia. In Samarkand, Timur’s grandson, \nUlugh Beg, built the largest astronomical observatory\nin the world at the time. Even after the fall of Timur's empire, his descendant Babur re-established\nhimself in India, founding the Mughal Empire, which would become home to nearly \na quarter of the world’s population and which built such splendors\nas the Red Fort and Taj Mahal. Timur's legacy is still celebrated\nin monuments across Central Asia, where he is remembered as \n“Buyuk Babamiz” or “our great forefather.” And yet today in Europe, India,\nand much of the Middle East, he's remembered as a butcher. That’s more reflection of the success\nof his own propaganda than of the man himself. Hold on now, I think\nI’ve almost got the king cornered!

Or so they thought. To their surprise,\nthey soon discovered it was actually 1 am; and the sky wasn’t lit by the Sun,\nbut rather by brilliant drapes of light. The blazing glow could be seen as far \nas the Caribbean, leading people in many regions to believe\nthat nearby cities had caught fire. But the true cause of what would come\nto be known as the Carrington Event was a solar storm—\nthe largest in recorded history. Solar storms are one of many astrophysical\nphenomena caused by magnetic fields. These fields are generated by movements \nof electrically charged particles like protons and electrons. For example, Earth’s magnetic field \nis generated by charged molten metals circulating in the planet's outer core. Similarly, the Sun’s magnetic field \nis generated by large convective movements in the plasma that composes the star. As this plasma slowly swirls, it creates areas of intense magnetic\nactivity called sunspots. The magnetic fields that form \nnear these regions often become twisted and strained. And when they’re stretched too far,\nthey snap into simpler configurations, releasing energy that launches plasma\nfrom the Sun’s surface. These explosions are known \nas coronal mass ejections. The plasma— mostly made of protons \nand electrons— accelerates rapidly, quickly reaching thousands\nof kilometers per second. A typical coronal mass ejection covers\nthe distance between the Sun and the Earth in just a couple of days, flowing along the magnetic field \nthat permeates the solar system. And those that cross the Earth’s path\nare drawn to its magnetic field lines, falling into the atmosphere \naround the planet’s magnetic poles. This tidal wave of high-energy particles\nexcites atmospheric atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen, causing them to rapidly shed\nphotons at various energy levels. The result is a magnificent light show\nwe know as the auroras. And while this phenomenon is usually \nonly visible near the Earth’s poles, strong solar storms can bring in \nenough high energy particles to light up large stretches of the sky. The magnetic fields in our solar system\nare nothing compared to those found in deep space. Some neutron stars generate fields \n100 billion times stronger than those found in sunspots. And the magnetic fields \naround supermassive black holes expel jets of gas that extend \nfor thousands of light years. However, on Earth, even weak solar storms\ncan be surprisingly dangerous. While the storms that reach us \nare generally harmless to humans, the high-energy particles \nfalling into the atmosphere create secondary magnetic fields, which in turn generate rogue currents \nthat short-circuit electrical equipment. During the Carrington Event, the only widespread electrical\ntechnology was the telegraph. But since then, we've only become more\ndependent on electrical systems. In 1921, another powerful solar\nstorm caused telephones and telegraph equipment \naround the globe to combust. In New York, the entire railway system \nwas shut down and fires broke out in the central control building. Comparatively weak storms in 1989 and 2003 turned off regions \nof the Canadian power grid and damaged multiple satellites. If we were hit by a storm as strong\nas the Carrington Event today, it could devastate our interconnected,\nelectrified planet. Fortunately, we're not defenseless. After centuries of observing sunspots, researchers have learned \nthe Sun’s usual magnetic activity follows an 11-year cycle, giving us a window into when solar storms\nare most likely to occur. And as our ability to forecast\nspace weather has improved, so have our mitigation measures. Power grids can be shut off \nin advance of a solar storm, while capacitors can be installed \nto absorb the sudden influx of energy. Many modern satellites and spacecraft \nare equipped with special shielding to absorb the impact of a solar storm. But even with these safeguards, it’s hard to say how our technology \nwill fare during the next major event. It’s possible we’ll be left with only\nthe aurora overhead to light the path forward."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What generates magnetic fields?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The appearance of Auroras"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The presence of electrically charged particles at rest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The movement of electrically charged particles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The presence of a compass"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Areas of intense magnetic activity on the surface of the Sun are characterized by ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The absence of sunspots"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stronger emission of light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A compass needle spinning all around"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The presence of many sunspots"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How long does it take for a typical coronal mass ejection to reach Earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less than 10 seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A few days"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Months"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Coronal mass ejections never reach Earth"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What astronomical objects feature magnetic fields even 100 billion times stronger than the ones characterizing sunspots?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Asteroids"}, {"label": "B", "text": "White dwarfs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Some neutron stars"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Magnetic fields found in sunspots are the strongest."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What happens at the peak of the solar cycle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Solar storms are more likely to occur."}, {"label": "B", "text": "There are no sunspots on the surface of the Sun."}, {"label": "C", "text": "As Aristotle said, the Sun is immutable, and a cycle cannot exist."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Winters are warmer."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Center Realm is home to three \nelder dragons: two ice, one fire, and they’ve lived in harmony \non the east coast for centuries. But scouts have sighted three fire dragons\nand five ice dragons flying across the Western Ocean. You’ll only have a few hours to assign \nthem their designated regions before they’ll arrive. Elder dragons are extremely territorial. Each must have its own, \nofficially acknowledged stomping ground. They’ll peacefully roost there unless\ntheir region borders another dragon of the same type, in which case the matching dragons \nwill go on a rampage. However, fire and ice dragons \ncan border each other, and matching regions can touch at corners. You’ll soon have 11 dragons\nand just 8 regions. Fortunately, you have enough \npolitical capital to create 3 new regions, each of which must be \ncompletely enclosed spaces. Add more or otherwise mess this up,\nand you’ll lose your job and your head. Where do you draw lines \nand place the new dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It isn't difficult to create\nthree new regions. What is more challenging \nis to make sure the result will keep each dragon\naway from its own kind. For instance, this can be \nneither ice nor fire, because it borders both. However, create a new region like this,\nand suddenly there are viable options. Why did that work? Look at the point\nwhere these four regions meet. If you go around it, it alternates\nbetween fire and ice. Before the new line was added,\nthat wouldn’t have worked. Nor would 5 or 7 regions. 6 and 8, however, both do. The pattern is that points where lines\nmeet must be surrounded by an even number of regions. As long as that’s true, you can color \nthe map in two colors, by alternating them around those points. In our initial arrangement,\nthere were six such meeting points. So what we want to do is connect\nthose to each other. Each line adds a single new region\nthat touches both meeting points. There are several ways to do this\nto accommodate all 8 new dragons. You’ve done such a great job \nthat your boss puts you in a ship and sends you out across the Western Sea\nto investigate where these new dragons are coming from. There you’re met\nwith a civilization in disarray. Their 17 elder dragons are ravaging \nthe countryside, wiping out the peasants, devastating all the people \nand their thatch-roofed cottages. And here there aren't just ice and fire\ndragons, but lightning dragons too. Their people will only allow \nthe creation of two new regions. Where do you create new regions\nand place all the dragons? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Unfortunately, our meeting-point trick\nwon’t suffice now that there are three dragon types, so we need to find another\nmethod to identify problem areas. A great way to do so is to experiment: focus on one area and start coloring\nuntil we run out of possibilities. Take this section. These 3 regions all border each other,\nso they need to be different colors. But they also all touch this giant\nterritory, which we now can’t color. To generalize the issue, when there are\n4 regions that all border each other, it's impossible to color\nthem with three colors. The map has two other such areas. So what you need to do is break them up. And once again, the key is drawing lines\nbetween points where multiple problematic regions touch. No matter how you do it, you’ll effectively subdivide \nthe giant territory into smaller ones. Now coloring the map becomes\na logic puzzle. So long as you approach it systematically\nby starting in one area and radiating out, you’ll reach an arrangement \nthat you can fit all your dragons into, shifting the colors as needed. Just assign this region last, \nbecause it’ll have two options. You've saved not one, but two continents\nfrom certain ruin.

Then you wake up. But how do you know\nyou’re not dreaming now? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s actually very difficult \nto explain how, definitively, you know you’re awake. So difficult, in fact, that it has puzzled\nphilosophers since ancient times. In the butterfly scenario, the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi\nsurfaced a mystifying possibility: if we can dream of being \nan entirely different creature, who's to say we're not actually a different creature dreaming \nof being human? Bizarre things happen in dreams: you fly, or conjure an all-you-can-eat \ndessert buffet out of thin air, or get chased by witches through the halls\nof your elementary school, which suddenly looks a lot like Paris. But the strange things that happen \nin dreams don’t seem strange at the time. So how do you know you’re not\nin a dream right now that will seem very strange\nafter you wake up? Well, it is possible to notice the strangeness of a dream\nwhile you’re dreaming. Lucid dreamers know they’re dreaming. By definition, if you were having \na lucid dream, you would know it. But all that proves is \nthat you’re not having a lucid dream— it doesn’t prove you’re awake. There has to be a surefire test— something that never— or only—\nhappens when you’re awake, something that never— or only—\nhappens in a dream. Wake up.\nNo, that isn’t it— you can wake up in a dream. Pinch yourself.\nIf it hurts, aren’t you really awake? Try to read or write something. Run around the room. Does your pace seem normal \nor suspiciously slow? Suspiciously fast? Can’t tell? Try to remember\nthe last time you ran. Actually, that brings us \nto an even better test from the 17th century French philosopher\nRené Descartes. He pointed out that in our memories,\ndreams are disconnected— the events of a dream don’t fit\nin to the chain of events in our waking lives. This seems rock solid, doesn't it? You couldn’t possibly have swum \nwith dolphins in a nameless pink sea between Christmas \nand New Year’s Eve because you didn’t leave Kansas \nand you have the receipts to prove it. Well, one of Descartes’ contemporaries, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes,\nhad something to say about that: what if Descartes was performing his test\nin a dream? What if we ask an expert? A neuroscientist can measure the activity\nin different parts of your brain and tell you whether you’re awake\nor sleeping. But that just brings us back to the idea\nthat any test you might use to prove you’re awake \ncould take place in a dream. So far, no one has found\na convincing response to this. But let’s be real: there’s a whole lot\nmore detail in our waking experience than in dreams. We go to sleep and wake up again\nday after day for many years, and each new day is full  of countless \npeople, places, things, experiences. Even our memories, which capture \njust a fraction of this experience, contain an almost incomprehensibly vast\namount of detail: we can recall a line from a favorite book\ndecades later, remember the musty smell of its pages and the taste of the lemonade we drank \nwhile reading it, remember a dream we had\nabout it and tell someone all this. Isn't it ridiculous to suggest a dream\ncould ever simulate this richness? Well, as the Persian philosopher\nal-Ghazali pointed out, in the same way we think we are now awake\nhaving woken from dreams, it is possible that we might wake \nfrom our current state into another state \nof even greater wakefulness. Which would mean we’re really\nin a kind of dream-state when we think we’re awake. What philosophers really want to know \nis what justifies our belief that we’re awake. We all want to believe things\nbecause we have reasons for them, not just because they seem right.

Like many of you here, I watched the crisis in Syria\nunfold in front of me on the TV. My family is originally from Syria, and very early on, I lost several family members\nin really horrifying ways. I'd sit and I'd gather with my family\nand watch the TV. We've all seen those scenes: bombs destroying buildings, chaos, destruction and people screaming and running. It was always the people screaming\nand running that really got me the most, especially those\nterrified-looking children. I was a mother to two young,\ntypically inquisitive children. They were five and six then, at an age where they typically\nasked lots and lots of questions, and expected real, convincing answers. So, I began to wonder\nwhat it might be like to parent my children\nin a war zone and a refugee camp. Would my children change? Would my daughter's bright,\nhappy eyes lose their shine? Would my son's really relaxed and carefree\nnature become fearful and withdrawn? How would I cope? Would I change? As psychologists and parent trainers, we know that arming parents\nwith skills in caring for their children can have a huge effect\non their well-being, and we call this parent training. The question I had was, could parent training programs\nbe useful for families while they were still in war zones\nor refugee camps? Could we reach them\nwith advice or training that would help them\nthrough these struggles? So I approached my PhD supervisor, Professor Rachel Calam, with the idea of using my academic skills\nto make some change in the real world. I wasn't quite sure\nwhat exactly I wanted to do. She listened carefully and patiently, and then to my joy she said, \"If that's what you want to do,\nand it means so much to you, then let's do it. Let's find ways to see if parent programs can be useful for families\nin these contexts.\" So for the past five years,\nmyself and my colleagues -- Prof. Calam and Dr. Kim Cartwright -- have been working\non ways to support families that have experienced\nwar and displacement. Now, to know how to help families\nthat have been through conflict support their children, the first step must obviously be\nto ask them what they're struggling with, right? I mean, it seems obvious. But it's often those\nthat are the most vulnerable, that we're trying to support, that we actually don't ask. How many times have we just assumed\nwe know exactly the right thing that's going to help someone or something\nwithout actually asking them first? So I travelled to refugee camps\nin Syria and in Turkey, and I sat with families, and I listened. I listened to their parenting challenges, I listened to their parenting struggles and I listened to their call for help. And sometimes that was just paused, as all I could do was hold hands with them and just join them\nin silent crying and prayer. They told me about their struggles, they told me about the rough,\nharsh refugee camp conditions that made it hard to focus\non anything but practical chores like collecting clean water. They told me how they watched\ntheir children withdraw; the sadness, depression, anger, bed-wetting, thumb-sucking,\nfear of loud noises, fear of nightmares -- terrifying, terrifying nightmares. These families had been through\nwhat we had been watching on the TV. The mothers -- almost half of them\nwere now widows of war, or didn't even know\nif their husbands were dead or alive -- described how they felt\nthey were coping so badly. They watched their children change\nand they had no idea how to help them. They didn't know how to answer\ntheir children's questions. What I found incredibly astonishing\nand so motivational was that these families were\nso motivated to support their children. Despite all these challenges they faced, they were trying to help their children. They were making attempts\nat seeking support from NGO workers, from refugee camp teachers, professional medics, other parents. One mother I met had only been\nin a camp for four days, and had already made two attempts at seeking support\nfor her eight-year-old daughter who was having terrifying nightmares. But sadly, these attempts\nare almost always useless. Refugee camp doctors, when available, are almost always too busy, or don't have the knowledge or the time\nfor basic parenting supports. Refugee camp teachers and other parents\nare just like them -- part of a new refugee community\nwho's struggling with new needs. So then we began to think. How could we help these families? The families were struggling with things\nmuch bigger than they could cope with. The Syrian crisis made it clear how incredibly impossible it would be\nto reach families on an individual level. How else could we help them? How would we reach families\nat a population level and low costs in these terrifying, terrifying times? After hours of speaking to NGO workers, one suggested a fantastic innovative idea of distributing parenting\ninformation leaflets via bread wrappers -- bread wrappers that were being delivered\nto families in a conflict zone in Syria by humanitarian workers. So that's what we did. The bread wrappers haven't changed\nat all in their appearance, except for the addition\nof two pieces of paper. One was a parenting information leaflet\nthat had basic advice and information that normalized to the parent\nwhat they might be experiencing, and what their child\nmight be experiencing. And information on how they could\nsupport themselves and their children, such as information like spending\ntime talking to your child, showing them more affection, being more patient with your child, talking to your children. The other piece of paper\nwas a feedback questionnaire, and of course, there was a pen. So is this simply leaflet distribution, or is this actually a possible means\nof delivering psychological first aid that provides warm,\nsecure, loving parenting? We managed to distribute\n3,000 of these in just one week. What was incredible was\nwe had a 60 percent response rate. 60 percent of the 3,000\nfamilies responded. I don't know how many\nresearchers we have here today, but that kind of response\nrate is fantastic. To have that in Manchester\nwould be a huge achievement, let alone in a conflict zone in Syria -- really highlighting how important\nthese kinds of messages were to families. I remember how excited and eager we were\nfor the return of the questionnaires. The families had left\nhundreds of messages -- most incredibly positive and encouraging. But my favorite has got to be, \"Thank you for not forgetting\nabout us and our children.\" This really illustrates\nthe potential means of the delivery of psychological\nfirst aid to families, and the return of feedback, too. Just imagine replicating this\nusing other means such as baby milk distribution,\nor female hygiene kits, or even food baskets. But let's bring this closer to home, because the refugee crisis is one that is having an effect\non every single one of us. We're bombarded with images daily\nof statistics and of photos, and that's not surprising, because by last month, over one million refugees\nhad reached Europe. One million. Refugees are joining our communities, they're becoming our neighbors, their children are attending\nour children's schools. So we've adapted the leaflet\nto meet the needs of European refugees, and we have them online, open-access, in areas with a really high\nrefugee influx. For example, the Swedish healthcare\nuploaded it onto their website, and within the first 45 minutes, it was downloaded 343 times -- really highlighting how important it is for volunteers, practitioners\nand other parents to have open-access,\npsychological first-aid messages. In 2013, I was sitting on the cold,\nhard floor of a refugee camp tent with mothers sitting around me\nas I was conducting a focus group. Across from me stood an elderly lady with what seemed to be\na 13-year-old girl lying beside her, with her head on the elderly lady's knees. The girl stayed quiet\nthroughout the focus group, not talking at all, with her knees\ncurled up against her chest. Towards the end of the focus group, and as I was thanking\nthe mothers for their time, the elderly lady looked at me\nwhile pointing at the young girl, and said to me, \"Can you help us with...?\" Not quite sure what she expected me to do, I looked at the young girl and smiled, and in Arabic I said, \"Salaam alaikum. Shu-ismak?\" \"What's your name?\" She looked at me really\nconfused and unengaged, but then said, \"Halul.\" Halul is the pet's name\nfor the Arabic female name, Hala, and is only really used\nto refer to really young girls. At that point I realized that actually\nHala was probably much older than 13. It turns out Hala was a 25-year-old\nmother to three young children. Hala had been a confident,\nbright, bubbly, loving, caring mother to her children, but the war had changed all of that. She had lived through bombs\nbeing dropped in her town; she had lived through explosions. When fighter jets\nwere flying around their building, dropping bombs, her children would be screaming,\nterrified from the noise. Hala would frantically grab pillows\nand cover her children's ears to block out the noise, all the while screaming herself. When they reached the refugee camp and she knew they were finally\nin some kind of safety, she completely withdrew\nto acting like her old childhood self. She completely rejected her family -- her children, her husband. Hala simply could no longer cope. This is a parenting struggle\nwith a really tough ending, but sadly, it's not uncommon. Those who experience\narmed conflict and displacement will face serious emotional struggles. And that's something we can all relate to. If you have been through\na devastating time in your life, if you have lost someone\nor something you really care about, how would you continue to cope? Could you still be able\nto care for yourself and for your family? Given that the first years\nof a child's life are crucial for healthy physical\nand emotional development, and that 1.5 billion people\nare experiencing armed conflict -- many of whom are now\njoining our communities -- we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the needs of those\nwho are experiencing war and displacement. We must prioritize\nthese families' needs -- both those who are internally displaced,\nand those who are refugees worldwide. These needs must be prioritized\nby NGO workers, policy makers, the WHO, the UNHCR\nand every single one of us in whatever capacity it is\nthat we function in our society. When we begin to recognize\nthe individual faces of the conflict, when we begin to notice\nthose intricate emotions on their faces, we begin to see them as humans, too. We begin to see\nthe needs of these families, and these are the real human needs. When these family needs are prioritized, interventions for children\nin humanitarian settings will prioritize and recognize the primary\nrole of the family in supporting children. Family mental health\nwill be shouting loud and clear in global, international agenda. And children will be less likely\nto enter social service systems in resettlement countries because their families\nwould have had support earlier on. And we will be more open-minded, more welcoming, more caring and more trusting to those\nwho are joining our communities. We need to stop wars. We need to build a world where children\ncan dream of planes dropping gifts, and not bombs. Until we stop armed conflicts\nraging throughout the world, families will continue to be displaced, leaving children vulnerable. But by improving parenting\nand caregiver support, it may be possible to weaken the links\nbetween war and psychological difficulties in children and their families. Thank you.

He manages to dodge Nazi falcons\nthen beats on through stormy weather, flying an average of 79 kilometers\nper hour for almost five hours straight. Paddy’s carrying the first news \nof the D-Day invasion back to England. He wins a medal for gallantry\nfor this accomplishment. Paddy was one of around 250,000 pigeons used by the British during World War II\nto speedily transport secret messages. In fact, pigeon delivery systems\nare ancient human practices. Seeing their meat as a protein source and their nitrogen-rich poop \nas the perfect fertilizer, humans brought pigeons into captivity\nas far back as 10,000 years ago. We then tapped into other traits. Pigeons are naturally speedy \nand possess a powerful homing instinct that drives them to navigate\nlong distances back to the location they consider “home.” So we began developing pigeon posts\nand breeding and training them for racing. In a hobby called \n“pigeon fancying,” people selected for traits \nlike head plumage and fabulously feathered feet. As we carried pigeons around the world,\nthey escaped or were released, forming the wild urban flocks\nwe're familiar with today. Pigeons are now one of the most abundant,\nwidespread species on the planet, managing to thrive in chaotic cities. They owe their success to an ideal\ncombination of traits, including some that were\naccentuated by humans. Unlike birds that nest \non the ground or in trees, pigeons were originally cliff-dwellers. City buildings mimic \ntheir natural habitat. And pigeons set a notoriously \nlow bar when it comes to homemaking. Add some sticks to any window ledge\nor highway overpass and it's a great spot to raise babies. This unfussiness allows them to live \nin environments where more specialized species can’t. As generalists, pigeons take advantage \nof urban food waste. With an organ in their throats \ncalled a crop, they can gorge themselves when food is\navailable and store some for later. They provide “crop milk” to their young\ninstead of having to fetch them live food. Chicks grow quickly with this \nfat and protein-rich meal. If conditions are right,\npigeons breed year-round and produce new offspring every six weeks. They actually have higher breeding rates\nin cities because of the abundance \nof food and shelter. These booming populations \nattract predators. New York City is home \nto a million pigeons, which support large populations\nof raptors. But pigeons’ aptitude for swift flight, further exploited by being bred\nfor racing, means they’re made \nfor high speed chases. Compared to barn owls,\nwhich are a similar size, pigeon wing bones are thicker \nand more curved, providing extra space for muscle mass. They can reach speeds \nof 125 kilometers per hour. And their large flocks ensure safety\nin numbers and more eyes on the lookout. While pigeons play a starring role\nin urban wildlife, we’re not always enthusiastic neighbors. In 1966, New York’s parks commissioner\ncoined the term “rats with wings” and it stuck. Indeed, their poop, which we originally cherished \nas fertilizer, presents a unique problem. Just one pigeon can leave behind \n11 kilograms of acidic excrement per year, which, in the United States, \nscales to about $1.1 billion in structural damage annually. Though incidents of infection are rare, this poop can host fungi \nthat are harmful to people if inhaled. They may be numerous, noisy \nand a little too keen on your lunch, but the pigeons that swirl around us are evidence of an ancient, \nongoing relationship. Their rise to world domination has been\na collaborative effort. For better or for worse, \nwe did this to ourselves."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how long ago did humans bring pigeons into captivity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1,000 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5,000 years ago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10,000 years ago"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Historically, where did pigeons build their nests?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "ground"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cliffs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "trees"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bushes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "“Homing” refers to a pigeon’s:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "ability to find their way home"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the type of nest a pigeon builds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the sound pigeons make"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Having a crop (an organ in their throat) allows pigeons to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "provide “crop milk” to their young"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eat lots of food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "store food for later"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How fast have pigeons been recorded flying?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5 kilometers per hour"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20 kilometers per hour"}, {"label": "C", "text": "125 kilometers per hour"}, {"label": "D", "text": "500 kilometers per hour"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Andrea Garcia had been accused\nof skipping school and being sexually promiscuous, so the authorities responsible \nfor juvenile delinquents committed her to a state hospital. After being administered an IQ test\nand assigned a low score, the doctors made their verdict. They told Sara her 19-year-old daughter\nwould be sterilized to prevent passing on what the state saw\nas a mental deficiency. This horrific tale may sound like a story\nfrom an authoritarian regime. But in fact, it took place \nin Southern California in 1938. And Andrea Garcia was one of thousands\nof poor women of color targeted by the state’s relentless\ncampaign of eugenics. Since ancient Greece, there have been\nefforts to control human populations via reproduction, retaining some\ntraits and removing others. But in the 19th century, the discovery\nof evolution and genetics inspired a new scientific movement \ndedicated to this endeavor. In 1883, British scientist \nSir Francis Galton named this idea eugenics, drawn from the Greek word\nfor “to be well born.” This wave of modern eugenicists \nincluded prominent scientists and progressive reformers who believed\nthey could improve society by ensuring that only desirable traits\nwere passed down. However, their definition of what traits \nwere and were not desirable was largely determined \nby the prejudices of their era. Entire categories of people \nwere considered “unfit” for reproduction, including immigrants, people of color\nand people with disabilities. Meanwhile, their ideal genetic standard \nreflected the movement’s members: white Europeans\nof Nordic or Anglo-Saxon descent. As the influence of eugenics spread\nin the early 20th century, many countries restricted immigration\nand outlawed interracial unions. These measures to improve so-called\n“racial hygiene” were taken to their horrific conclusion\nin Nazi Germany. The Nazi eugenics campaign \nsystematically killed millions of Jews, as well as individuals from other groups, including Roma, gay men, \nand people with disabilities. Outside their extreme brutality, however, Nazi eugenic policies reflected\nsimilar standards across the globe. Throughout the mid-20th century, many countries enacted eugenics policies, and governments in Sweden, \nCanada, and Japan forcibly sterilized\nthousands of individuals. Sterilization was exceptionally common\nin the US. From 1907 to 1979, US policies enforced the sterilization \nof over 60,000 people, with 32 states passing laws \nthat mandated sterilization for men and women \ndeemed “mentally defective.” This label was typically applied based \non superficial mental health diagnoses and the results of IQ tests, which were linguistically and culturally\nbiased against most immigrant populations. These racist standards were particularly\nproblematic in California. From 1920 to 1945, Latina women were \n59% more likely to be sterilized than other women. And the rate of sterilizations\nin California was incredibly high— this single state performed over one third\nof the country’s sterilization operations. Such was the case of Andrea Garcia, whose story reflects thousands \nof individuals with similar fates. With the help of famed civil rights lawyer\nDavid Marcus, Andrea’s mother argued \nthat California’s sterilization law violated the US Constitution, depriving Andrea of her rights \nto equal protection under the law. However, while one of the three judges\noverseeing the case voted to spare Andrea, the other two did not. Records suggests it’s possible \nAndrea escaped the impending surgery, but many more victims \nof these policies did not. Although eugenics acquired negative\nconnotations after the horrors of World War II, many of its practices, including\nsterilization, continued for decades. By the late 1960s, research \ninto human genetics was more nuanced, and bioethics had begun \nto blunt eugenics’ influence. Yet Sweden and the US continued \nto pursue involuntary sterilization well into the 70s. Finally, class action lawsuits and protest\nmarches in the US galvanized lawmakers, and California’s sterilization laws \nwere finally repealed in 1979.

She could make use of it skills, \nshe thought. Through careful observation and imitation,\nshe soon became a skilled weaver. The sun god, Kinich Ahau, \nwas impressed with her work, and admired her from afar. But the goddess’ grandfather\nwas very possessive and would not let the sun god \nanywhere near his beloved granddaughter. To get past the grandfather,\nthe sun god disguised himself as a hummingbird. As he took a drink \nof tobacco flower honey, the moon goddess spotted him \nand asked her grandfather to capture the bird for her. The grandfather shot the disguised sun god\nwith a blow dart, stunning him. Ix Chel nursed the wounded bird \nback to health, and soon, he was able to spread his wings\nand fly again.

But the storm god had already\nthrown a lightning bolt, which hit the crab and pierced her\nthrough her heart, killing her. Hundreds and hundreds of dragonflies\ngathered, buzzing songs and fluttering \ntheir transparent wings. They formed a thick, magical cloud \nover the moon goddess’ body. For thirteen days the dragonflies cut, \ncleaned, and hollowed thirteen logs. On the thirteenth night, \nthe logs burst open, and the moon goddess emerged—\nalive and more brilliant than ever.

Unfortunately, the story \ndoesn’t end there. The sun god’s brother visited often. Sensing he was also in love with Ix Chel, \nthe sun god grew jealous, and began to mistreat her. One day, Ix Chel was sitting \non the riverbank, furious at her husband. A huge bird came gliding down and offered to take her\nto the high mountain peaks. To get away from the cruel sun god,\nshe agreed. There, she met the king of the vultures. The vulture king was kind and fun-loving— a much better partner\nthan the violent sun god. The moon goddess made a new home\nwith him in the mountains. When the sun god heard, he was distraught. He hid inside a deer carcass\nuntil a hungry vulture came swooping down, then hopped onto its back \nand rode to the mountain kingdom where the moon goddess now lived\nwith the vulture king.

The Simpsons would be the second \nBlack family in the otherwise white neighborhood,  \nwhere they intended to build a home. When the Simpsons refused offers \nto buy them out, their neighbors tried blocking\ntheir home’s construction. They finally moved into their house, \nbut the incident had a ripple effect. Just a few months \nafter the mob harassed the Simpsons, the first racially restrictive covenant\nwas put into place in Minneapolis. Covenants are agreements in property deeds\nthat are intended to regulate how the property is to be used. Beginning in the mid-1800s, people in the United States and elsewhere\nbegan employing them in a new way: specifically, \nto racially restrict properties. They wrote clauses into deeds that were \nmeant to prevent  all future owners from selling or leasing \nto certain racial and ethnic groups, especially Black people. Between 1920 and 1950, these racial covenants spread\nlike wildfire throughout the US, making cities more segregated \nand the suburbs more restricted. In the county encompassing Minneapolis, racial covenants eventually appeared \non the deeds to more than 25,000 homes. Not only was this legal, but the US Federal Housing Administration promoted racial covenants \nin their underwriting manual. While constructing new homes, real estate developers began racially\nrestricting them from the outset. Developments were planned as dream\ncommunities for American families— but for white people only. In 1947, one company began building\nwhat became widely recognized as the prototype of the postwar American\nsuburb: Levittown, New York. It was a community \nof more than 17,000 identical homes. They cost around $7,000 each \nand were intended to be affordable for returning World War II veterans. But, according to Levittown’s \nracial covenants, none of the houses could “be used or occupied by any person \nother than members of the Caucasian race,” with one exception: servants. Between 1950 and 1970, the population of the American suburbs\nnearly doubled as white people flocked \nto more racially homogenous areas in a phenomenon known as “white flight.” The suburbs spread, replacing native ecosystems with miles\nof pavement and water-guzzling lawns. And their diffuse layout necessitated\ncar travel. American automobile production quadrupled\nbetween 1946 and 1955, cementing the nation's dependence on cars. Federal programs like the G.I. Bill\noffered American veterans favorable lending rates for buying homes. But it was difficult for people of color\nto take advantage of such resources. Racial covenants restricted them\nfrom certain neighborhoods. And, at the same time, government programs\nlabelled neighborhoods of color bad investments and often refused\nto insure mortgages in those areas. Therefore, banks usually wouldn’t lend\nmoney to people purchasing property in neighborhoods of color—\na practice that became known as redlining. So, instead of owning homes \nthat increased in value over time, creating wealth that could be passed\nto future generations, many people of color were forced\nto spend their income on rent. And even when they were able \nto buy property, their home’s value was less likely\nto increase. The suburbs boasted cul-de-sacs \nand dead ends that minimized traffic. Meanwhile, city planners often identified\nredlined neighborhoods as inexpensive areas \nfor industrial development. So, the massive freeway projects \nof the mid-20th century disproportionately cut \nthrough redlined neighborhoods, accompanied by heavy industry\nand pollution. As a result, many neighborhoods of color\nexperience higher rates of drinking water contamination, asthma,\nand other health issues. People targeted by racial covenants\nincreasingly challenged them in court and, in 1968, they were finally banned\nunder the Fair Housing Act. But the damage had been done. Racial covenants concentrated wealth\nand amenities in white neighborhoods and depressed the conditions \nand home values in neighborhoods of color. As of 2020, about 74% of white families \nin the US owned their homes, while about 44% of Black families did. That gap is greatest \nin Minnesota’s Twin Cities. Across the country,\nneighborhoods remain segregated and 90% of all suburban counties\nare predominantly white. Some landlords, real estate agents,\nand lenders still discriminate against people \nbased on race— rejecting them, steering them to and away \nfrom certain neighborhoods, or providing inaccessibly\nhigh interest rates. Gentrification and exclusionary \nzoning practices also still displace and keep people of color\nout of certain neighborhoods. Racial covenants are now illegal. But they can still be seen\non many housing deeds. The legacy of racial covenants is etched\nacross the pristine lawns of the American suburbs. It’s a footnote in the demographic divides\nof every city. And it’s one of the insidious architects\nof the hidden inequalities that shape our world."}, "multiple-choice": []}

russia go to war with ukraine all week you've heard numerous answers to this question in ukraine 71 of the people believe their country is already at war with russia this is a complex crisis and all the answers are hidden in history did you know there was a time when kier was more powerful than moscow there was also a time when ukraine and america were adversaries tonight we'll bring you all these stories we will tell you why russian president vladimir putin is obsessed with ukraine i'm palki sharma padhya and this is gravitas plus we begin in the ninth century there was a state called kevin ruse this is where it was located the slavic people lived here the city of kiev was their capital between 980 and 1015 the kevin ruse was ruled by grand prince volodymir in russian his name is vladimir in ukrainian volodymir and as fate would have it these are also the names of the presidents of these two countries today anyway russians ukrainians and better russians draw their lineage from this slavic state a lot changed in the centuries that followed and for a lot of it ukraine was under russian rule in the 1900s the two were soviet republics russia the most powerful of the 15 republics and ukraine the second most powerful it had defence industries large agricultural lands and housed much of the soviet nuclear arsenal during the cold war ukraine was the arch rival of the united states the soviet union collapsed in 1991 ukraine became independent as did russia ukraine inherited much of soviet nuclear arsenal but gave it up to russia in 1994. in exchange moscow guaranteed ukraine's security and promised to respect its sovereignty they signed the budapest memorandum along with these countries cut to november 2013 viktor yanukovych was the president of ukraine he had a reputation for heavy-handedness corruption and above all for being openly pro-moscow in 2013 he rejected an eu trade deal this deal could have meant greater integration with the european union instead yanukovych decided to take a 15 billion dollar bailout from russia to many ukrainians it felt like being sold to moscow so protests broke out they were called euromaidan euro because these protests were about europe and maidan because they happened in kiev's maidan what we today know as the independent square here protesters chanted signed the eu deal yanukovych must step down russia supported the president the west supported the protesters in february 2014 yanukovich's government was toppled the president was driven out of ukraine he fled to russia not every ukrainian was happy with this many in the russian speaking east wanted yanukovich to stay when he was driven out the minority felt disenfranchised on the other side of the border russia was angry it had lost its puppet to salvage the situation moscow annexed crimea why crimea well let's now zoom into this part of the world crimea is a peninsula it is located in the black sea in 1954 soviet leader nikita khrushchev transferred crimea it was given to the ukrainian soviet socialist republic from the russian soviet socialist republic why khrushchev hoped the transfer would strengthen quote unquote brotherly ties between the ukrainian and russian people both russia and crimea were part of the soviet union so this transfer did not mean very much when ukraine became independent in 1991 crimea joined it the peninsula was given special autonomy it remained home to russian military bases moscow promised to respect crimean autonomy many in russia were of the opinion that crimea should not have been allowed to join ukraine in 2014 when yanukovych was ousted from power in ukraine russian military began seizing government buildings in crimea so the entire peninsula was under military occupation a referendum followed on the 16th of march 2014 crimeans voted to become a part of russia was this vote legitimate well it depends on who you ask for putin this was crimea's liberation for the rest of the world this was crimea's annexation the focus then shifted to eastern ukraine where russia backed separatists had seized territory ukrainian forces did not launch an all-out offensive at first but on the 17th of july 2014 when a flight carrying 298 people were shot down by these rebels ukrainian forces decided to flush out the rebels the separatists began losing ground so the russian army stepped in they invaded eastern ukraine and fought alongside the rebels what followed was a series of talks between russia ukraine and the west they resulted in the minsk accords this was first signed in 2014 both sides agreed on ceasefire and military withdrawal ukraine agreed to hold elections in the rebel-held areas eight years on the minsk accords remain unimplemented ukraine stands as the largest european country excluding russia it covers an area of more than six hundred thousand square kilometers with a population of 44 million and a gdp of more than 155 billion dollars per capita income more than 3 700 today ukraine is divided between east and west in more ways than one the west sees itself as more european the east is closer to russia be it in terms of geography or sentiment in the west most ukrainians speak ukrainian in the east a third are native russians in the west russia is looked at with suspicion in the east russia is looked at through the lens of shared history and heritage ukraine also remains at war its forces are fighting the rebels in the east rebel leaders are ruling at least two regions donetsk and luansk together they're known as the donbass region russia has once again sent its troops this time they're stationed right at the border what does vladimir putin want for nato to stop expanding nato stands for north atlantic treaty organization it's a military alliance these countries are the founding members of nato these countries joined it during the cold war and these countries joined after it ukraine wants to join nato too but putin wants nato to exclude ukraine and every former soviet state and this is just half the story like i said a lot is hidden in history for starters there is domestic politics when putin annexed crimea his approval rating skyrocketed keeping the nationalistic drum rolling helps the russian president annexing parts of ukraine also helps putin restore russia's superpower image again back to history many russians view ukraine's independence as a mistake it is true that ukraine was ruled by russia in fact ukraine has barely remained independent pre-1991 there was a brief period before world war one and then another stint in 1600 for the rest of its modern history ukraine was under russia one in six ukrainians is an ethnic russian one in three speaks russian as a native language so putin is right when he says historically they were one but claiming ukraine on the basis of colonial history is wrong it will be like britain claiming india or south africa or spain claiming the philippines past imperialism cannot justify present-day expansionism here's what else history tells us ukraine was forcefully crucified cut to 1700 russian leader katherine the great started russifying ukraine ethnic russians were shipped to this part of the world schools were told to teach russian language by 1800 the ukrainian language was banned in 1930 soviet leader joseph stalin steered a famine in ukraine millions of eastern ukrainians were killed the area was then repopulated with ethnic russians in the 1940s the ethnic tartars were relocated they too were replaced with russians there is a reason why eastern ukraine today has so many native russian speakers it was designed to be that way eastern ukraine was always dear to russia it has coal it has iron fertile land its historical connection with russia was forced both in time and again talks about the holy ruse he says russians and ukrainians are one people seventy percent ukrainians reject this thought seventy two percent consider russia a hostile state today thirty three point three percent ukrainians are ready to take up arms against russia twenty one point seven percent are ready to stage a civil resistance against russia 67 percent ukrainians want to join the eu 59 percent want to join the nato meet the current ukrainian president volodymyr zielenski he came to power in 2019 following a landslide victory he is a vocal critic of russia zelensky openly opposes russian occupation of eastern ukraine 73 percent of ukrainian voters voted this man to power today volodymir zelensky represents the pulse of ukraine the ukraine that wants to remain independent of russia but vladimir putin wants to become the man who revived russian imperialism he does not realize the world has moved on [Music]"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question":

You’re a particle of matter, \namidst a chaotic stew of forces, fusion, and annihilation. If you’re lucky\nand avoid being destroyed by antimatter, you'll be the seed of a future galaxy. You gravitate towards a ring of particles\nthat have devised a game. A friendly gluon explains: there are an equal number of matter \nand antimatter particles. At the blow of a cosmic whistle, every particle of matter with a particle \nof antimatter to its immediate right will merge with that anitparticle\nto—poof!— both annihilate. The circle will tighten \nto make a smaller circle, and the process will repeat \nuntil just one particle of matter remains. They’d been waiting for someone like you,\nas with a perfectly balanced setup, no one would be left in the end. As guest of honor, they’ll let you choose \nwhere to insert yourself into the ring. What spot should you choose to make sure\nyou’re the last particle standing? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Explanation in 3 Explanation in 2 Explanation in 1 A general strategy can’t rely on knowing\nwhat the circle looks like. But we can rely on how it should end: \nwith you as the last particle standing. Let's start there and work backwards. Just before this, there were also \nsome matter/antimatter pairs. Here’s 3 for the sake of example. This right away suggests a strategy. You can simulate annihilations \nin any circle by marking all pairs \nof adjacent particles, then the newly adjacent pairs, and so on,\nto reach this final set. If you map them back \nto the original circle, standing to the immediate left \nof those final matter particles or the immediate right \nof final antiparticles means you’ll reach this endgame state \nand survive. So here are the safe spots \nin all three given circles. You find a good position and experience\nthe bittersweet radiance of your new friends pairing off\nand becoming pure energy. You’re soon left alone. But wait a minute! Today’s the big day. You’re an intelligent creature of matter\namidst a chaotic crowd of alien races. Every hundred million years, sentient species of the galaxy \nsend emissaries to the core to pay tribute to the galactic seed \nyou’re all descended from. Each of the 27,182 attendees has brought a cube of matter \nand a cube of antimatter. Except you: you’ve been chosen \nto represent your famed ancestor and reenact its moment of choice. Everyone places their matter \nand antimatter cubes in a ring. Your job: pick a spot to stand \nwhere you won’t be annihilated. The ring is too large to simulate\nannihilations like before, but you have a programmable device\nyou can point at spots between cubes. The device can detect the full sequence\nof cubes around the circle, count cubes of each type,\nperform arithmetic, and carry out simple logical commands. How do you program your device \nto identify safe spots? Pause to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Let’s go back to our earlier approach: running time backwards \nstarting from you alone, then a sequence of pairs of cubes. A second step back produces more pairs\nnestled between existing cubes. As does the next, and the next,\neach adding nestled pairs like a Russian doll \nof fundamental particles. A pair never forms around an existing cube\nbecause only adjacent cubes annihilate. Your survival depends \non the matter particles to your right buffering you from antimatter. We can mathematically model this idea \nwith a sum, starting with your +1. For instance, this would be +1+1-1+1-1. From your perspective, \nno matter how far you look, this sum will be positive. Considering how we introduced pairs, \nthis makes sense— each inserted plus was immediately\nfollowed by a minus. If we examine the starting position\nof any other matter cube, its sum will eventually hit zero. The moment that happens \nmarks its exact annihilation partner. Again, our introduction of pairs \nreflects this; nestled pairs only delay the inevitable\nfor the outer cubes. We can now program the device. Start a running sum with +1,\nrepresenting you, and scan around the circle. For each matter cube, add one, and for each antimatter cube, \nsubtract one. If all 54,364 cubes have been scanned without the sum ever hitting 0, that spot is safe. Nothing left to do \nbut enjoy the fireworks."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Could four particles of matter and four particles of antimatter arrange themselves in a ring to provide you four different safe places to stand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Could four particles of matter and four particles of antimatter arrange themselves in a ring to provide you just one safe place to stand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Could one-million particles of matter and one-million particles of antimatter arrange themselves in a ring to provide you just one safe place to stand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Could four particles of matter and four particles of antimatter arrange themselves in a ring to provide you exactly two safe places to stand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Could one-million particles of matter and one-million particles of antimatter arrange themselves in a ring to provide you exactly 177 safe places to stand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Eight particles of matter and six particles of antimatter are arranged in a ring and play the same annihilation game.

Stretching 227 meters into the sky, these 22,000-ton towers would help support\nCalifornia’s Golden Gate Bridge. But since they were currently\nin Pennsylvania, they first had to be dismantled,\npackaged, and shipped piece by piece over 4,500 kilometers away. Moving the bridge’s towers \nacross a continent was just one of the challenges \nfacing Charles Ellis and Joseph Strauss, the project's lead engineers. Even before construction began, \nthe pair faced all kinds of opposition. The military feared the bridge \nwould make the important harbor an even more vulnerable target. Ferry companies claimed the bridge\nwould steal their business, and residents wanted to preserve\nthe area's natural scenery. Worse still, many engineers thought\nthe project was impossible. The Golden Gate Strait was home \nto 96-kilometer-per-hour winds, swirling tides, an endless blanket of fog, and the earthquake-prone \nSan Andreas fault. But Strauss was convinced \nthe bridge could be built; and that it would provide \nSan Francisco’s commuters more reliable passage to the city. He was, however, a bit out of his depth. Strauss’s initial plans to span the strait\nused a cantilever bridge. This kind of bridge consists \nof a single beam anchored at one end and extended horizontally\nlike a diving board. Since these bridges can only extend so far\nbefore collapsing under their own weight, Strauss’s design used two cantilevers,\nlinked by a structure in the middle. But Ellis and his colleague Leon Moisseif\nconvinced Strauss to pursue a different approach:\nthe suspension bridge. Where a cantilever bridge is supported\nfrom one end a suspension bridge suspends its deck\nfrom cables strung across the gap. The result is a more flexible structure that’s resilient to winds \nand shifting loads. This kind of design had long been used \nfor small rope bridges. And in the 1930s, \nadvanced steel manufacturing could create cables of bundled wire \nto act as strong steel rope for large-scale construction. At the time, the Golden Gate Bridge was the longest and tallest \nsuspension bridge ever attempted, and its design was only possible\ndue to these innovations. But cables and towers of this size \ncould only be built at large steelworks on the country’s east coast. While the recently completed Panama Canal made it possible to ship these components\nto California, reassembling the towers on site \ndidn’t go quite as smoothly. It was relatively easy to find a stable,\nshallow foundation for the north tower. But building the south tower \nessentially required erecting a ten-story building underwater. Since the strait’s depth prevented them\ndrilling or digging the foundations, bombs were dropped on the ocean floor,\ncreating openings for pouring concrete. A seawall was built to protect the site\nfrom powerful currents, and workers operated in 20-minute shifts\nbetween tides. The towers had so many compartments\nthat each worker carried a set of plans to prevent getting lost. And at one point, an earthquake rocked\nthe south tower nearly 5 meters in each direction. Strauss took worker safety very seriously,\nrequiring hard hats at all times and stretching a safety net \nbelow the towers. But not even these precautions \ncould prevent an entire scaffolding platform\nfrom falling in 1937, carrying ten workers to their deaths. Once the towers were complete, \nworkers spun the cables in place, hung suspenders at 50-foot intervals,\nand laid down the concrete roadway. The bridge was finished,\nbut there was still one more task ahead: painting it. After production, the steel had been \ncoated with a reddish paint primer it maintained throughout construction. But the Navy had been pushing hard to paint the bridge \na tactical black and yellow. Consulting architect Irving Morrow \nactually thought the primer itself paired nicely with the strait’s \nnatural backdrop— and he wasn’t alone. Citing numerous letters from locals, Morrow’s 30-page pitch \nto paint the bridge “international orange” beat out the Navy’s plans. And today, this iconic color \nstill complements the strait’s blue water, green hills, \nand rolling fog."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of these was NOT one of the structural difficulties of building a bridge across the Golden Gate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Impenetrable bedrock"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Earthquakes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Strong winds and tides"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of these was NOT one of the arguments against the bridge’s construction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Security concerns from the military"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ferry companies fearing competition"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Disruption of wildlife habitats"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where were the bridge towers constructed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "California"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pennsylvania"}, {"label": "C", "text": "New York"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who was the chief engineer behind the bridge?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "John Roebling"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Irving Morrow"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Joseph Strauss"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When was the bridge completed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1937"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1929"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1943"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

A mountain nymph named Echo, \nrenowned for her charm and chatter, was regaling her with a sensational story. But what Hera didn’t know \nwas that Echo was merely distracting her while her husband, Zeus, was frolicking about \nwith the other nymphs. Unfortunately for Echo, Zeus got sloppy,\nand Hera realized what was going on. Enraged by Echo’s duplicity— and powerless to stop \nher husband’s adultery— Hera decided to silence\nthe nymph for good. From then on, Echo could no longer\nenrapture listeners with her stories; she could only repeat the last words\nanother said. As her conversations became dull \nand her company undesirable, Echo grew dispirited. One day, while Echo was drifting\nthrough the woods, she spotted a young man hunting deer. It was Narcissus, the stunningly beautiful\nson of a river god and water nymph. After his birth, a seer had given \nhis mother a cryptic prophecy: Narcissus would live a long life—\nbut only if he never really knew himself. No one was sure exactly \nwhat to make of this. And, in the meantime,\nNarcissus grew into a proud youth. His good looks attracted many admirers. But he preferred to amble through life\non his own and left a trail of broken hearts \nin his wake. Seeing Narcissus there, \nEcho was filled with longing. Unable to initiate a conversation,\nshe walked after him. Soon, Narcissus heard a rustle, \nand called out, “Who goes there? Who are you?” Echo revealed herself,\nbut only repeated the word “you,” making her tone as endearing as possible\nas she went to hold him. Agitated, Narcissus said, \n“Let me go, I can’t stay.” Echo could only counter \nwith a plea for him to do so. Freeing himself from her embrace,\nNarcissus snapped, “I’d rather die than have you love me!” To which Echo could only cry,\n“Love me... love me.” Narcissus told Echo once more \nto leave him alone, then faded from her gaze. Echo wandered to a cave. And gradually, her heart grew heavy\nand her body frail until all that was left of her \nwas her voice, which the wind carried to vast,\nempty places. Forever after, it could be heard \nreverberating through hollow caves and rebounding across lonely clearings. But this wasn’t even the first time\nheartbreak over Narcissus had proven fatal. A young man named Ameinias had also been\ncruelly rejected by Narcissus. Before his death, he prayed to Nemesis,\nthe goddess of revenge, that Narcissus would also one day\nknow the pain of love. She heard Ameinias’ pleas and, \nupon witnessing Echo’s fate, decided that it would be \nthe final affront. It was time for retribution. So, Nemesis set Narcissus \ntowards a clear, glassy pool. As he bent towards the water to drink, he caught sight\nof a hauntingly beautiful young man. Never before had Narcissus \nseen himself with such clarity. He spent the day acquainting himself\nwith every glinting angle and glowing curl then passed the evening \ngazing at his reflection by moonlight and sleeping with his fingers\ngrazing the water. Days wore on, and Narcissus never parted\nfrom his one true love. When he reached out, \nhis double reached for him; and when he leaned in to bestow a kiss,\nhe also tilted his face. But when he tried to hold \nthe bewitching figure, it disappeared. At last, Narcissus knew the agony\nof unrequited love. Eating and drinking nothing, \nNarcissus too wasted away. His neck ached from bending over the lake,\nand his legs became rooted to the grass. When the wood nymphs finally passed by, all that was left of him \nwas a white and yellow flower bending towards its reflection.

And why don't we all have them? - Richard Browning", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-jetpacks-work-and-why-don-t-we-all-have-them-richard-browning-debbie-browning", "transcript": {"en": "On April 12, 1961,\nSoviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin piloted a 2,400 kilogram spacecraft \nin humanity’s first manned space flight. One week later, Bell Aerosystems debuted\nanother advancement in aviation: the gas-powered rocket pack. Capable of flying 35 meters \nin just 13 seconds, the rocket pack thrilled onlookers. But the device’s engineers\nwere less enthused. Despite years of cutting-edge work, they knew this short flight was all\nthe rocket pack could muster. So why was a massive spacecraft easier\nto send flying than a single pilot? According to Newton's laws of motion, the physics behind flight are\nactually quite simple. All you need is a powerful enough\nupward force to counteract the downward force \nof gravity. And since objects with more mass\nexperience stronger gravitational forces, lighter objects should be easier\nto get off the ground. However, modern jet engines,\nour primary tool for flight, actually get more efficient\nthe larger they are. Jet engines work by sucking in huge\nvolumes of air, and then expelling that air\nas quickly as possible. While most of this actually bypasses\nthe inner machinery, it still contributes to a huge portion\nof the engine's thrust. But the air that does enter \nthe engine’s core gets compressed by a series of tightly packed blades. That compressed air then enters\nthe combustion chamber, where it is injected with jet fuel\nand ignited. The heat causes the compressed air \nto rapidly expand, bursting out of the exhaust \nand propelling the engine forward. As air leaves the engine it also turns \na turbine embedded in the exhaust nozzle. This turbine powers the fan\nand the compressor blades, creating a cycle that maintains thrust\nfor as long as there’s fuel to burn. The more air an engine can take in and \nexpel the more thrust it can produce. On a modern jet, the diameter \nof a frontal fan is larger than a truck. And even spinning \nat relatively low speeds, these engines produce more than enough\nthrust to maintain the necessary speed for flying a passenger aircraft. But smaller engines simply can’t \ntake in this much air. For most of the 20th century,\nengineers couldn’t produce an engine small and light enough \nfor an individual to wear, yet powerful enough to lift itself \nalongside its pilot and fuel. Designs could only carry enough fuel\nfor 30 seconds of flight, and when airborne, \nthe powerful thrust in a single direction made jetpacks difficult\nand dangerous to control. But the new millennium brought advances\nin materials, manufacturing, and computing technology, including systems which could manage\nfuel injection with incredible precision. Together, these dramatically improved \nthe fuel efficiency and power-to-weight ratio of jet engines. By 2016, micro-engines the size \nof a coffee can and weighing less than 2kg could achieve 220 Newtons of force. This was when an English engineer\nnamed Richard Browning saw the opportunity to create \na new kind of lightweight jetpack. In addition to a single engine\nstrapped to the back, this so-called Jet Suit involved a pair\nof micro-engines on each arm to split and balance the thrust. Working with the back engine,\nthese provided three-points of stability, which some pilots describe as being \nakin to comfortably leaning on crutches while a friend supports your back. It may seem complicated to manage\nall these engines at once, but many pilots master \nit in less than a day with the help of another \nadvanced computer system— their brain. Various brain regions \nand multiple sensory systems perfectly calibrate our sense of balance \nand spatial orientation, helping pilots smoothly\ndirect their flights. Slight movements of the arms allow\noperators to increase and decrease lift, quickly turn in mid-air, \nor glide forward for up to 5 minutes. This technology is still fairly new, and without major advances\nin fuel efficiency and engine technology, don’t expect to have a jetpack\nof your own any time soon.

Based on measurements taken from tens\nof thousands of young men and women, they were called Norma and Normman. That same year, a contest launched\nto find a living embodiment of Norma. Normal is often used as a synonym\nfor “typical,” “expected,” or even “correct.” By that logic, most people should fit \nthe description of normal. And yet, not one of almost 4,000 women \nwho participated in the contest matched Norma,\nthe supposedly “normal” woman. This puzzle isn’t unique \nto Norma and Normman, either— time and time again, \nso-called normal descriptions of our bodies, minds, and perceptions \nhave turned out to match almost no one. And yet, a lot of the world is constructed\naround a foundation of normalcy. So what does normal actually mean—\nand should we be relying on it so much? In statistics, a normal distribution \ndescribes  a set of values that fall along a bell curve. The average, or mean, of all the values\nis at the very center, and most other values fall \nwithin the hump of the bell. These curves can be tall, with most values\ninside a narrow range, or long and flat, with only a slight bias\ntowards the average. What makes the distribution normal \nis that it follows this curved shape. Normal doesn’t describe a single data \npoint, but a pattern of diversity. Many human traits, like height,\nfollow a normal distribution. Some people are very tall or very short, but most people fall close \nto the overall average. Outside of statistics, normal\noften refers to an average— like the single number pulled \nfrom the fattest part of the bell curve— that eliminates all the nuance\nof the normal distribution. Norma and Norman’s proportions\ncame from such averages. Applied to individuals, \nwhether someone is considered normal usually depends on how closely \nthey hew to this average. At best, such definitions of normal \nfail to capture variation. But oftentimes, our calculations of normal\nare even more flawed. Take the BMI— or Body Mass Index. BMI is a measure of weight\nrelative to height, with different ratios \nfalling into “underweight,” “normal weight,” “overweight,”\nand “obese” ranges. Generally, only BMIs that correspond\nto normal weight are considered healthy. But BMI is not always \nan accurate predictor of health, or even of what’s a healthy weight. BMI doesn’t take into account \nbody fat percentage, body fat distribution, levels of physical\nactivity, or blood pressure. And yet, those who fall outside\nthe so-called normal range are commonly advised that losing\nor gaining weight will improve their health. When we apply a standard of normal\nto all of humanity that’s based on data \nfrom a non-representative slice, we’re not just choosing one\npoint on the distribution, we’re choosing it \nfrom the wrong distribution. A lot of behavior science research draws\nfrom samples that are pretty WEIRD— meaning Western, educated, \nindustrialized, rich, and democratic. These features can skew norms even in research that doesn’t have\nan obvious link to them. Take the famed \nMuller-Lyer optical illusion: it’s normal to think one \nof the two lines is longer, when they’re actually the same length. At least, it is if you’re\nan American undergraduate. A team of anthropologists \nand psychologists found other demographic groups\nwere much less susceptible— members of the San people of the Kalahari weren’t susceptible \nto the illusion at all. When these limited or inaccurate\ndefinitions of normal are used to make decisions \nthat impact people’s lives, they can do real harm. Historically, such concepts of normal\nhave been hugely influential. The Eugenics Movement of the early 20th \ncentury weaponized the concept of normal, using it to justify exclusion, violence, \nand even extermination of those deemed not normal. To this day, people are often targeted\nand discriminated against on the basis of disabilities, \nmental health issues, sexual orientations, gender identities, and other features\ndeemed “not normal.” But the reality is that the differences\nin our bodies, minds, perceptions, and ideas about\nthe world around us— in short, diversity— \nis the true normal."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In 1945, two sculptures, meant to represent the average man and woman in the United States, went on exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History.

The entire court was invited—\nsave the wicked sorceress Morgan le Fay— and food and drink flowed freely. But in the midst of the revelry,\nthe castle doors split open. A towering knight riding an emerald\nsteed burst into the room, stunning the court into silence. Then, in a deep bellowing voice,\nhe proposed a game. The Green Knight declared he would allow the bravest warrior present to attack him\nwith his own axe. If they could strike him down, \nthey would win his powerful weapon. However, the knight would be allowed\nto return that blow in one year and one day. Arthur and his knights were baffled. No man could survive such a strike. The Green Knight began to mock\ntheir leader’s hesitance, and Arthur stood to defend his honor. But as soon as he gripped the axe,\nanother leapt to take his place. Arthur’s nephew, Sir Gawain,\ntook the weapon instead. And with one swift strike, he beheaded\nthe grinning knight. But the moment his skull met the ground,\nit began to laugh. The Green Knight collected his head \nand mounted his horse. As he rode off, his severed head\nreminded Gawain of their contract and told him to seek the Green Chapel\none year hence. In the months that followed, Gawain tried\nto forget this bizarre vision. But despite the strangeness\nof the knight’s game, he was determined to act honorably. When the following winter approached,\nhe set out— enduring foul weather \nand beastly encounters in his quest to find \nthe mysterious Green Chapel. Finally, on Christmas Eve, he saw \na shimmering castle on the horizon. The castle’s lord and lady were thrilled\nto help such an honorable guest, and informed him that the Green Chapel\nwas only a short ride away. They implored Gawain to rest at their home\nuntil his meeting with the Green Knight. Thrilled at this news, Gawain happily\naccepted their offer. However, in exchange \nfor their hospitality, the lord made a strange request. Over the next three days, he would go\nhunting and share his spoils every night. In return, Gawain must give him whatever\nhe’d gained during his day at the castle. At first, Gawain was perplexed\nby these strange terms. But the lord’s meaning became quite clear\nthe next day, when his wife tried to seduce Gawain. To rebuff the lady’s advances \nwithout offending her honor, Gawain allowed one kiss— which he then passed on to her husband\nin exchange for a slain dear. The next day, Gawain allowed two kisses,\nwhich he gave to the lord for a dead boar. But on the third day, the lady offered\nmore than just three kisses. She presented a magical sash \nthat would protect Gawain from the Green Knight’s blade. Gawain accepted immediately, \nbut that evening, when the lord returned, the knight offered only three kisses \nwith no mention of his enchanted gift. The next morning, Gawain rode \nout to the Green Chapel— a simple mound of earth where the Green Knight \nominously sharpened an axe. With the sash’s protection, \nGawain approached stoically— determined to honor his agreement. He bowed his head for the deadly blow,\nand with a massive swing, the Green Knight cut Gawain’s neck— inflicting nothing more\nthan a flesh wound. Once more, Gawain was bewildered. Why hadn’t the sash protected him? And why hadn’t the knight \nkilled him? Bursting into laughter, the Green Knight \nrevealed himself to be the castle’s lord, and he’d been working with Morgan Le Fay to test the honor and bravery \nof Arthur’s knights. He was impressed with Gawain’s behavior, and he’d planned to spare \nhis neck entirely— until Gawain concealed the sash. Filled with shame, \nGawain returned to Camelot. But to his surprise, \nhis companions absolved him of blame and celebrated his valor.

He’s older than 1, but beyond that,\nhe looks timeless. You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200. The birthday boy is a giant, and you're afraid that if your\nforgetfulness becomes known, you'll become part of the feast. The baker has meticulously prepared\na small mountain range of a cake, and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age\nas the chocolate centerpiece. You would love to just count\nthe candles on the cake, but you're much too small\nto see the top of it. Then you remember: the baker made\nan interior tunnel to activate the candles from below. While the giant is asleep, \nyou can sneak in, count the candles and escape undetected. As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit\nand brace yourself for vanilla cream. Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see \nwhether the candle above you is lit, and can switch it on or off. Some are currently on, and others off,\nin no discernible pattern. The tunnel is a single loop, and in the \ndark you can’t tell its shape or size. You aren’t carrying anything with you,\nand any marks you make will disappear. You need a strategy. How can you count the candles? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 There are a few ways \nto solve this problem. Let's start with the most straightforward. There’s exactly one way to mark\na location in the tunnel: the state of the candle. You can mark the first candle you reach \nby lighting it or keeping it on. If you walk forward, you’ll eventually\nfind another lit candle— either a new one or you’re starting one. The question is: how could you know which? Here’s one approach: turn it off \nand backtrack to the start by passing the same number of candles \nyou passed on the way there. If the starting candle is now off, you’ve completed the loop\nand know the giant’s age! Otherwise, depart again, \ncontinuing until the next lit candle, testing if it’s your starting one \nand so on. This will work... eventually. But if the giant isn’t young,\nand many candles are on, you might have a marathon to run\nbetween now and sunrise. And you definitely don’t want to be \nin the cake when he starts digging in. So let’s look for a more \nefficient solution. How about testing a series of hypotheses\nabout the giant's age? Suppose you guess he’s turning 10. You could light the starting candle, \nwalk forward 10, switch or leave the destination \ncandle off, and return. If the starting candle’s still on,\n10 isn’t the answer. If it’s off, 10 could be right, \nbut you may have made multiple loops— so 10′s factors 5 and 2\nare also possibilities. Then you would have passed\na repeating pattern— but that could have just been\nthe starting arrangement. So what if you changed the candles\non the way? If you turned them all on while walking \nfrom candle 1 to 11, switch that off, then turn back, the first unlit candle you find \nwould tell you the exact candle count. And if you don't hit any\nextinguished candles, you'll know that the total\nmust be higher than 10. You could then pick a larger guess\nand try again. To be systematic, you could increase \nyour guess by the same number each time, say 4. If there were 99 candles, this method would take 24 roundtrips \nand involve visiting nearly 2,700 candles. But you don’t have to increase\nyour guess linearly. For instance, you could double it, \nfrom 10 to 20 to 40, and discover the true number \non your 5th trip after around 560 candles. Doubling allows you to reach\nhigh numbers quickly, while starting with small intervals \nin case there are only a few candles. After expecting a lengthy trek, you’re pleased to discover \nthe giant is only turning 12. You hurry to change into slightly\nmore inconspicuous clothing; chisel up some enormous chocolate numbers;\nand at the party, make your own wish: that you’re not downwind when your friend \nblows out his candles."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why is there a tunnel in the cake?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "For hiding from the giant."}, {"label": "B", "text": "For decorating it from the inside."}, {"label": "C", "text": "For using as a racetrack."}, {"label": "D", "text": "For lighting the candles."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why do you need to know the giant’s age in such a rush?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "You don't want him to know you've forgotten it."}, {"label": "B", "text": "His birthday party is tomorrow."}, {"label": "C", "text": "You're responsible for sculpting the number in chocolate."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why is leaving marks in the tunnel unsuccessful?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The baker meticulously removes all marks while doing his rounds."}, {"label": "B", "text": "If the giant notices the marks, you'll be in trouble."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Any marks you make will instantly disappear."}, {"label": "D", "text": "You have no way to distinguish between the marks you make."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the starting pattern of the candles when you enter the tunnel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They're all on."}, {"label": "B", "text": "You have no idea."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They're all off."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They're alternating on and off."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "We finally find out how old the giant is turning.

But why? It turns out that pupil shape \nis a powerful indicator of what role an animal plays \nin its ecosystem. Pupils mark the hollow opening\nin the iris, the eye’s band of pigmented muscle. They’re the portholes through which\nlight enters the eye, where it then strikes the retina \nand activates light-sensitive cells, setting the process of vision in motion. Pupils are black because most of the\nlight that enters them is absorbed. Their size changes in response\nto brightness, as well as certain drugs \nand emotional and mental states— but their basic form varies greatly\namong species. House cats, for one, are twilight hunters \nwith vertically elongated pupils. In the dark, these structures\nexpand dramatically, taking in the available light. When it’s bright, they shrink into slits. In fact, cat pupils are so flexible that\ntheir maximum area is 135 times greater than their minimum area— whereas our pupils only shrink\nand expand 15-fold. And because of how the slit pupil \ntakes in light, it creates sharp, vertical contours. When the cat’s brain processes \nthe visuals from each eye, the small but sharp differences \nbetween them help the cat judge \nthe precise distance of its target. In fact, many other ambush hunters also\nhave vertically elongated pupils— but mainly those whose eyes are\nlocated closer to the ground. This may be because these pupils are\nespecially useful in perceiving objects at the relative short distances\nthese animals tend to hunt. The world looks very different from behind\nthe horizontally elongated pupils of many grazing and browsing animals, \nlike goats. These pupils, situated \non either side of the head, let horizontal bands of light in that\ngive the goat a near-360-degree view and provide it with sharp,\nhorizontal images. This helps goats detect any\ndisruption to the horizon— alerting them to potential predators— \nwhile still enabling them to see ahead and detect obstacles \nas they make their escape. In fact, goats always keep their pupils\naligned with the horizon, rotating their eyeballs in their sockets\nas they move their heads up and down. Meanwhile, nocturnal geckos have pupils\nthat shrink into slits studded with pinholes \nin higher light conditions. Each pinhole projects a separate, sharp\nimage onto the geckos retina. Scientists think that comparing \nthese different inputs might help the gecko judge distance\nwithout having to move. And while they might have fooled you, mantises and other insects and crustaceans\nhave “pseudopupils.” These aren’t optical structures; they’re optical illusions \nexperienced by the observer. Mantises have compound eyes composed\nof thousands of light-sensing units. When some are aimed at you,\nthey appear black because they’re absorbing most wavelengths\nof incoming light— but there’s no actual opening. So, why do we have round pupils? Elongated pupils help sharpen certain\ndimensions of an animal's vision. But scientists think that, for animals\nlike us with circular pupils, this is a lower priority. Instead of seeing some elements \nof a scene in extreme focus, we see a larger picture \nin relative detail, which enables more general skills \nof observation. This may be especially helpful\nfor foragers looking for food, hunters eyeballing and chasing\ntheir prey, and social animals recognizing \nother faces. As we peer at different pupils, \npatterns emerge. And yet there are exceptions. For example, Pallas’s cats and mongooses\nare both small ambush predators, but the Pallas’s cat has round pupils\nand mongooses have goat-like pupils. And we’ve only explored\na few pupil shapes. Other animals have crescent-\nor heart-shaped pupils. And the cuttlefish has perhaps\nsome of the most bizarre: their pupils are circular in the dark,\nbut W-shaped in the light.
