The rare mineral appears \nin only 1% of rocks in the mine. But your friend Tricky Joe \nhas something up his sleeve. The unobtainium detector he’s been \nperfecting for months is finally ready. The device never fails \nto detect unobtainium if any is present. Otherwise, it’s still highly reliable, returning accurate \nreadings 90% of the time. On his first day trying \nit out in the field, the device goes off, and \nJoe happily places the rock in his cart. As the two of you head back to camp \nwhere the ore can be examined, Joe makes you an offer: he’ll sell you the ore for just $200. You know that a piece of unobtanium \nthat size would easily be worth $1000, but any other minerals \nwould be effectively worthless. Should you make the trade? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Intuitively, it seems like a good deal. Since the detector \nis correct most of the time, shouldn’t you be able\nto trust its reading? Unfortunately, no. Here’s why. Imagine the mine \nhas exactly 1,000 pieces of ore. An unobtainium rarity of 1% means that there are only 10 rocks \nwith the precious mineral inside. All 10 would set off the detector. But what about the other 990\nrocks without unobtainium? Well, 90% of them,\n891 rocks, to be exact, won’t set off anything. But 10%, or 99 rocks, \nwill set off the detector despite not having unobtanium, a result known as a false positive. Why does that matter? Because it means that all in all, 109 rocks will have \ntriggered the detector. And Joe’s rock could be any one of them, from the 10 that contain the mineral to the 99 that don’t, which means the chances of it containing \nunobtainium are 10 out of 109 – about 9%. And paying $200 for a 9%\nchance of getting $1000 isn’t great odds. So why is this result so unexpected, and why did Joe’s rock seem \nlike such a sure bet? The key is something called \nthe base rate fallacy. While we’re focused on the relatively \nhigh accuracy of the detector, our intuition makes us forget to account for how rare the unobtanium \nwas in the first place. But because the device’s error rate of 10% is still higher than \nthe mineral’s overall occurrence, any time it goes off is still more likely \nto be a false positive than a real finding. This problem is an example \nof conditional probability. The answer lies neither in the overall \nchance of finding unobtainium, nor the overall chance \nof receiving a false positive reading. This kind of background information \nthat we’re given before anything happens is known as unconditional, \nor prior probability. What we’re looking for, though,\nis the chance of finding unobtainium once we know that the device did\nreturn a positive reading. This is known as the conditional, \nor posterior probability, determined once the possibilities have \nbeen narrowed down through observation. Many people are confused \nby the false positive paradox because we have a bias \nfor focusing on specific information over the more general, especially when immediate decisions \ncome into play. And while in many cases \nit’s better to be safe than sorry, false positives can have \nreal negative consequences. False positives in medical testing \nare preferable to false negatives, but they can still lead to stress or\nunnecessary treatment. And false positives in mass surveillance can cause innocent people to be\nwrongfully arrested, jailed, or worse. As for this case, the one thing \nyou can be positive about is that Tricky Joe is trying \nto take you for a ride."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Inside the mine, how many of the rocks contain unobtanium?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "7"}, {"label": "B", "text": "8"}, {"label": "C", "text": "9"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If rocks that do not have obtanium trigger the detector, this is an example of _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An accurate reading"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A false positive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A spell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A broken detector"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Inside the mine, how many of the rocks contain unobtanium?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "7"}, {"label": "B", "text": "8"}, {"label": "C", "text": "9"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How many of the rocks will set off the detector despite not having unobtanium?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "99"}, {"label": "B", "text": "71"}, {"label": "C", "text": "32"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are the chances of Joe's ore containing unobtanium?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "9%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "13%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is prior probability?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The background information you receive before anything happens"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The background information you receive after something happens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The background information that is kept hidden from you"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inaccurate background information"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "If rocks that do not have obtanium trigger the detector, this is an example of _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An accurate reading"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A false positive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A spell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A broken detector"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 27, "lesson": 2, "title": "What causes constipation? - Heba Shaheed", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-constipation-heba-shaheed", "transcript": {"en": "Visiting the bathroom is part \nof the daily human experience. But occasionally, constipation strikes, a condition that causes \na backup in your digestive system. The food you eat can take several days \nto exit your body. And for many, \nconstipation can become chronic, meaning regularly passing lumpy \nhard stools accompanied by straining. What's behind this \nunsettling phenomenon? Constipation arises in the colon, \nalso known as the large intestine. This muscular organ is split\ninto four sections: the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colon, which connects with the rectum and anus. The small intestine delivers stool consisting of ingested food, \nbile, and digestive juices to the large intestine. As this stool moves through the colon, the organ siphons off most \nof the water it contains, transforming it from liquid to solid. The longer this transmission takes, the more reabsorption occurs,\nresulting in increasingly solid stool. Once it reaches the sigmoid colon, a final bout of reabsorption \noccurs before it enters the rectum, distending its walls and telling\nthe internal anal sphincter to relax. This is the point where you can usually \ndecide whether to physically expel or retain the stool. That’s regulated by \nthe pelvic floor muscles, particularly the puborectalis and external anal sphincter. The puborectalis forms \na sling-like formation around the rectum called the anorectal angle. And when you voluntarily relax \nyour external anal sphincter, the stool is finally expelled. When you’re constipated, however, a desire to visit the bathroom isn't\nenough to coax your body into action. Usually there's two factors \nbehind this problem: the stool’s slow movement \nthrough the colon and/or pelvic floor dysfunction. In the first, stool moves excessively \nslowly through the intestines, causing over-absorption of liquid, \nwhich makes the stool dry and hard. With pelvic floor dysfunction, stool becomes difficult \nto eliminate from the rectum because of tightened pelvic floor muscles,\nor due to a pelvic organ prolapse, usually through childbirth or aging. Both of these problems \nmake the anorectal angle more acute and it becomes difficult to expel waste. To identify constipation precisely, researchers have developed metrics,\nsuch as the Bristol Stool Chart. Most people who look at that chart will be able to tell they’ve experienced \nconstipation before. When you’re on the toilet, you should\nideally be in a squatting position. With your buttocks firmly \non the toilet seat, you can elevate your feet on a stool and lean forwards with a straight back, which straightens the anorectal angle\nand eases the passage of waste. Going a day without a bowel movement \nisn’t necessarily cause for alarm. But if you are experiencing \nchronic constipation, simple dietary and lifestyle changes, like fibrous vegetables, regular exercise, abdominal massage, and 6 to 8 cups of water per day may help restore your daily\ntrip to the toilet."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the correct technique for squatting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elevate your feet on a stool and lean backward with a straight back"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elevate your feet on a stool and lean forward with a straight back"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keep your feet on the ground and lean forward with a straight back"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Keep your feet on the ground and lean backward with a straight back"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The large intestine is split into _______ sections.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does stool consist of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ingested food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bile"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Digestive juices"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which pelvic floor muscles regulate your body’s decision to physically retain or expel stool?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The large intestine and small intestine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The puborectalis and anorectal angle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The puborectalis and external anal sphincter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The factors behind constipation are _______ and _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A stool’s slow movement through the colon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A loosening of the small intestine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pelvic dysfunction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both a and c"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the correct technique for squatting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elevate your feet on a stool and lean backward with a straight back"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elevate your feet on a stool and lean forward with a straight back"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Keep your feet on the ground and lean forward with a straight back"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Keep your feet on the ground and lean backward with a straight back"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

We're often left to conclude that we are isolated at the more freakish and revolting end of human nature far from it we're just failing to imagine that others are, of course, every bit as disturbed as we are without knowing exactly what it is that troubles or racks another, outwardly very impressive person we can be sure that it will be something. We might not know exactly what they regret but there will be agonizing feelings of some kind we won't be able to say exactly what kind of unusual, sexual kink obsesses them? but there will be one and we can know this because vulnerabilities and compulsions cannot be curses that have just ascended upon us uniquely they are universal features of human mental equipment the solution to the impostor syndrome lies in making a crucial leap of faith: the leap that others' minds must work in basically much the same way as ours do everyone must be as anxious, uncertain and wayward as we are it's a leap of faith because we just have to accept that the majority of what we feel and are especially the more shameful, unmentionable sides will have a corollary in each and every one of us one of the tasks that works of art should ideally accomplish is to take us more reliably into the minds of people we're intimidated by in order to show us the more average, muddled and fretful experiences that they have that way, we would be helped to understand that we're not barred by our vulnerabilities from doing what they do that's what the philosopher Montaigne writing in the 16th century was attempting to do when he playfully informed his readers in plain French that \"kings and philosophers shit and so do ladies!\" Montaigne's point is that for all the evidence that exists about this shitting we might not guess that these people ever had to squat on a toilet we never see distinguished types doing this while of course we are immensely well informed about our own digestive activities and therefore we build up a sense that because we have crude and sometimes rather desperate bowels we can't be philosophers, kings or ladies and that if we set ourselves up in these roles we would just be impostors Montaigne's example is a neat one because despite the lack of evidence we know that these exalted people must of course excrete in exactly the same way we do So, with Montaigne's guidance we're invited to take on a saner sense of what grand, powerful and beautiful people are really like but the real target isn't just an under confidence about bodily functions this point extends into the psychological arena too Montaigne might also have said that kings, philosophers and ladies are wracked by self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy sometimes bump into doors and have weird, lustful thoughts about members of their own families Furthermore, instead of considering only the big figures of 16th century France we could update this example and refer to CEOs, corporate lawyers, news presenters and successful start-up entrepreneurs they too, can't cope, feel they might buckle under pressure and look back on certain decisions with shame and regret No less than shitting, such feelings are not what separates us from them our inner frailties don't cut us off from doing what they do If we were in their roles, we'd not be impostors we'd simply be normal Making a leap of faith around what other people are really like helps us to humanize the world it means that whenever we encounter a stranger we're not really encountering a stranger we're in fact encountering someone who is, in spite of the surface evidence to the contrary in basic ways, very much like us and therefore, nothing fundamental stands between us and the possibility of responsibility, success and fulfillment."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The imposter syndrome begins in how children sense how different their parents are from them.

It's too easy to assume\nthat what makes us likable , are our strengths our accomplishments, the things\nwe're proud of. Certainly this impresses, but it isn't what draws others to us.

But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things. So, let's start small-- with minutes, hours, days. You probably spent the last 24 hours mostly sleeping and working, and you probably wasted a good chunk of yesterday on the Internet. Days become weeks, weeks become months, and then we have a year. Let's look at 2017. France started to train eagles to hunt terrorist drones, A Czech nuclear power plant held a bikini contest to pick their new intern, and people on the Internet made a challenge out of eating bleach. You know, the usual stuff. Let's go back further. A kid born in the first year of the 21st Century is 18 years old now. But the century is still young, even if you're not. It was largely shaped by the attacks on 9/11, which led to the war in Afghanistan and the invasion of Iraq. In March 2011, the Syrian Civil War began, and is still ongoing after seven years. Most of us were born in the 20th century, which had the two most devastating wars in human history, and the Cold War. For the first time ever, we could destroy ourselves with the nuclear weapons, and we almost did, but we also had a space race and left Earth for the first time. The Internet was also invented, which led to memes , but also to Facebook and Twitter, so all in all, we're not sure if this was a GOOD development. The average human lives about 79 years, which covers a good chunk of recent history. The oldest living person on Earth is currently Celino Jaramillo, who was born in 1896, which means that his birth was closer to Napoleon ruling Europe than to the current day. Only 250 years ago, the Industrial Revolution turned the world into a progress machine. Farmers became workers, and knowledge became easier to distribute. Around this time, we started the progress that is causing climate change today. Not that long ago, actually. The Theory of Evolution changed how we saw ourselves and the world we live in. Newton wrote down his theory of gravity. We discovered distant stars and very close bacteria. The 15th century was very eventful. Columbus's \"discovery\" of America and the fall of Constantinople marked the end of the Middle Ages. War was all the rage in the Middle Ages, but the number one killer was disease. The Black Plague killed every third European in just six years. Around 2,000 years ago, we set the arbitrary Year 1 of our calendar that most of the world follows today. But to a Roman, the world was already ancient. The Great Pyramids were constructed 4,500 years ago. So, to a Roman, the pyramids were older than the Romans are to us today. So long ago, that there were still living mammoths on Earth. A lot of history happened before that, even. Around 7,000 years ago, humans began writing things down. About 12,000 years ago, human organization exploded. We built our first temple, and around the world, mankind began farming, which enabled the rise of larger communities. Our dominance over planet Earth really begins here. Homo sapiens sapiens, the modern human, evolved at least 200,000 years ago. 50,000 years ago, the Cognitive Revolution expanded our minds and innovation. Back then, we shared Earth with at least five other human species that either died out or were killed by us. At least 2 million years ago, our ancestors already had control over fire and constructed tools from wood and stone. And six million years ago, the last common ancestors of chimpanzees and humans existed. So this graph is all of human history. Our close relative, Homo erectus, survived 10 times longer than we have existed. This tiny part is the human era. We have to zoom in a lot to even see your lifetime. Still, all of human history is not that long. 65 million years ago, the age of the dinosaurs ended in an enormous explosion. The dinosaurs ruled the Earth for over 165 million years. 27 times as long as all humans. That's so long, that it means a T-rex that lived at 65 million years ago is closer to us today than to a live Stegosaurus. Dinosaurs in the form of mighty chickens are still around today. Animal life on this planet started 600 million years ago. The earliest animals were fish and other small simple sea creatures, then came insects, then reptiles and finally, around 200 million years ago, mammals joined the party. Life itself began much further back. There is evidence that it appeared up to 4.1 BILLION years ago. For at least 3.5 billion years, life consisted only of single-celled organisms. 4.5 billion years ago, the Sun was born from a gigantic imploding gas cloud. 60 million years later, Earth formed. In those early years, frequent bombardment by comets and asteroids supplied the Earth with large oceans. But as far as the whole universe goes, our solar system is pretty new. 13.75 billion years ago, the universe was born. And about half a billion years later, our own galaxy formed from billions of stars. But what came before the Big Bang? The truth is... we don't know, and maybe we never will. And there you have it... The past. Now let's take a look at what we know about the future. In roughly 1 billion years, the Sun will be so hot that life on Earth becomes impossible. The death of the Sun 4 billion years later marks the end of life in the solar system. If we want to have a chance to survive, we need to have ventured to the stars. And what happens after that? In the next 100 billion years, most of the biggest stars around will die. The universe becomes dimmer and dimmer, illuminated only by smaller red and white dwarfs. But they too will eventually burn out and one day... the last star in the universe will die. The universe will turn dark, and at some point, even black holes will evaporate and die. When they do our, universe will reach its final stage: Heat death. Nothing changes anymore; the universe is dead. Forever. Now, you're feeling some pretty weird feelings right now, aren't you? We are, too. It's only natural. The good news is this is all far, far away. The only time that actually matters is now. That cute girl or boy you like, ask them out! Time is precious.

And if our current model \nof physics is correct, billions of sub-atomic \ndark matter particles are passing through \nthe Earth every second. Despite the prevalence of dark matter, its interactions are predicted to be rare \nand extremely weak. To detect these interactions, dark matter experiments need to be\nincredibly sensitive. With such sensitive equipment, the ever-present background radiation \non Earth’s surface would create so much noise in the data that any dark matter particles \nwould be completely overwhelmed. It would be like trying to hear\na pin drop on a busy city street. To solve this problem, scientists have had \nto dig deep into the Earth. Dark matter experiments are set up \nin specialized underground labs, either in mines or inside mountains. The rock that makes up \nthe Earth’s crust works like a filter, absorbing radiation \nand stopping disruptive particles. The ultra-pure water\nin which the detector is suspended adds an additional layer \nof radiation filtering. This shielding ensures that only \nthe particles scientists are looking for can make their way into the detectors. Once these particles reach \nan experiment’s inner vessel, scientists have a chance \nof detecting them. The detector media are chosen because \nthey’re exquisitely sensitive detectors that can be purified extremely well. These could be a liquid noble gas, germanium and silicon crystals, a refrigerant, or other materials. When radiation interacts, \nit leaves tell-tale signs, such as light or bubbles, which can be picked up by the sensors\ninside the detector. The detector media are held \nin a central chamber made of glass or a special type of acrylic. These chambers have to be able \nto hold the substance inside without interacting with it while withstanding incredible pressure \nfrom the water outside. The inner vessel is surrounded \nby powerful sensors designed to detect even the\ntiniest blips of light, or the sound vibrations \ncaused by a single bubble. Each sensor records data 24/7, and experiments run for months \nand years at a time, generating terabytes of data every day. Building dark matter detectors \nis as much a feat of engineering as it is a feat of physics. By the time an experiment \nis ready to start collecting data, years or decades of work and investment \nhave already gone into it, to the tune of tens \nof millions of dollars. As of 2017, no dark matter particles \nhave been directly detected. That’s not entirely surprising. Physicists expect these interactions to be\nincredibly rare and difficult to detect. In the meantime, scientists continue \nto develop new technologies and increase detector sensitivity, closing in on where dark matter is hiding. And when they find it, we’ll finally be able to bring the \nuniverse’s darkest secrets into the light."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What percent of the universe do scientists think contains dark matter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "70%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "55%"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How do we know dark matter exists?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Scientists have been able to detect it through their experiments"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It has been created in particle accelerators"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Visible matter doesn’t create enough gravity to explain the structure of the universe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We can recognize it because it gives off a distinct type of radiation"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What percent of the universe do scientists think contains dark matter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "70%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "55%"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why are dark matter experiments set up underground?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dark matter comes from the Earth’s core so it is easier to detect when closer to the source"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The rock filters out unwanted radiation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increased temperature underground helps keep the experiment stable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Experiment components are extremely sensitive to sunlight and need to be protected"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How much time does a typical dark matter experiment require?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Days"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Weeks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Months"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Years"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these cannot be used as a detector medium?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Refrigerant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Noble gas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Radium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Silicon"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Ancient people used this glue, made from a mixture of animal bone \nand plant materials, to waterproof baskets \nand construct utensils. And for thousands of years after, plants and animals were the glue \nthat held human civilization together. Today, we have enough types of tape and\nglue to build and repair almost anything. But what gives glue \nand tape their stickiness? And is one stronger than the other? Adhesives can be made \nfrom synthetic molecules or natural proteins and carbohydrates like the vegetable starch dextrin, the milk protein casein, and the terpenes in tree resin. In order to work, glue and tape need \nboth adhesive bonds and cohesive bonds. Adhesive bonds occur between \nan adhesive’s molecules and the molecules \nof whatever it’s sticking to. Cohesive bonds happen between \na glue or tape’s own molecules, holding it together. Most glues consist of adhesive polymers \ndissolved in a solvent that prevents them from sticking\nto the inside of the bottle. The strong smell of many glues \ncomes from the solvent, which evaporates when exposed to air. Some glues use water as a solvent, but others use chemicals \nthat can be harmful to inhale. Glues with two or more components that\nchemically react instead of just drying can create stronger bonds. Both the adhesive and cohesive bonds \nof glue are strong, but the drying process \nmakes them irreversible. This is why, if a glued surface \nis broken after it dries, it can’t be reattached without new glue. By contrast, \nwhen tape is applied to a surface, it forms weaker, reversible bonds, so you can peel a piece of tape off \na surface and use it again. These weak bonds, \ncalled Van der Waals forces, can occur between any two materials, but only if they’re \nextremely close together, closer than the naked eye can see. Tape usually consists of a backing coated \nwith a combination of a rubber or rubber-like \"stretchy\" component, and a compound called a tackifier. That’s the \"sticky\" component. A tape’s stickiness is determined by the proportion of elastic component \nand tackifier, the thickness of adhesive spread \nonto the backing, and the type of backing material. No chemical reaction occurs \nwhen tape is pressed onto a surface. Instead, the soft adhesive flows into \nthe cracks and grooves of the surface. This ability to slide into cracks and then\nstay in place is called viscoelasticity. Once the viscoelastic adhesive fills \nthese microscopic crevices, it is close enough to form \nVan der Waals forces. So what’s the world’s strongest adhesive? Well, there’s no one answer. In terms of absolute strength \nof adhesive bonds, glue is stronger than tape, but no single adhesive\nworks well in all circumstances. Of the glues, cyanoacrylates, \nor super glues, may form the strongest bonds, but two-component epoxy glues have much\nhigher resistance to heat and shearing, and are compatible \nwith a wider range of surfaces. So, if you wanted \nto dangle an anvil in the air, super glue might be your best bet. But if you’re doing so \nover an active volcano, you’d want an epoxy instead. And in order to work at all, glues need enough real estate \nwhere surfaces touch. If for some reason you wanted \nto make a chain of bowling balls, duct tape would be better. Engineers weigh similar, \nif less absurd, factors all the time. Choosing the right glue to withstand \nthe heat inside an engine is a matter of life and death. And though the strength \nof duct tape’s adhesive bonds can’t compete with those of epoxy glues, tape does have the advantage of \ninstantaneous stickiness in an emergency. Glue may be necessary \nto get a rocket to space, but when it comes \nto extraterrestrial repairs, stick to duct tape: \nliquid glues don’t work in zero gravity."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the oldest glue made of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A mixture of animal bone and plant materials"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A mixture of water and plaster"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A mixture of milk and dust"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A mixture of dirt and seawater"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Adhesives can be made from _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Synthetic molecules"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Natural proteins and carbohydrates"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both synthetic molecules and natural proteins and carbohydrates"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neither synthetic molecules and natural proteins and carbohydrates"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "After drying, the adhesive and cohesive bonds of glue are _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Reversible"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Irreversible"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Weak"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sticky"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What determines a tape’s stickiness?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The proportion of elastic component and tackifier"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The thickness of adhesive spread onto the backing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The type of backing material"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which glues have much higher resistance to heat and shearing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cyanoacrylates"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two-component epoxy glues"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Van der Waals forces"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Polymers"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 27, "lesson": 10, "title": "How do touchscreens work?", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/GxBbXrLG", "transcript": {"en": "Touchscreens are everywhere. Not just in smartphones, but in supermarkets,\nATMs, and even airplane seats. And you may have noticed that not all touchscreens\nare the same. The old-school touchscreens can be pretty\ntough to use -- sometimes it feels more like a push-really-hard-screen instead of a touchscreen. On the other hand, certain smartphones and\ncomputer monitors are really responsive to many different touch patterns. There are lots of different technologies out\nthere, but they’re all trying to achieve the same goal: sending precise electrical\nsignals from specific locations on the screen. One of the most widely used types is the resistive\ntouchscreen, where you have to physically push and bend the screen to make it work. Resistive touchscreens are made of two separate\nlayers: The top layer is made from a flexible and\ntransparent material, such as polyethylene, which is a common plastic used to make things\nlike soda bottles. And the bottom layer is made of something\nmore rigid, like a sheet of glass. To make the screen work, both of these layers\nare thinly coated with some sort of metal compound that conducts electricity, like indium\ntin oxide -- which is commonly used because it’s transparent. These layers are also separated by tiny insulating\ndots, which /don’t/ conduct electricity, called spacers. They keep the screens apart to make sure there\naren’t any false touch signals. When the screen is on, a small voltage is\napplied across the screen in both the horizontal and vertical directions. As soon as you push down on the flexible screen\nwith anything, like your finger or a stylus, it connects the two layers together. This changes the voltage, and a small processor\nconnected to the screen can calculate exactly where you pressed in X and Y coordinates. These resistive touchscreens are pretty affordable\nand durable. So, they’re useful for things like credit\ncard readers in grocery stores, where you need to capture touch data of a messy signature\n-- over and over again. But they can be a little frustrating to use\nif you don’t push hard enough. Plus, they normally can’t understand multiple-touches\nat the same time – so they’re no good for two-finger zoom or more complex tasks. That’s why these days, most smartphones\nrely on capacitive touchscreens, where your finger becomes a key part of the electronics. There are different kinds of capacitive touchscreens,\nand they can vary from device to device. But one basic design is a sheet of glass containing\na grid of hair-thin lines of a conductive metal, like indium tin oxide. The grid lines in one direction are called\nthe driving lines, which provide a constant electric current. And the lines in the other direction are called\nthe sensing lines, which detect this electric current. At every point where the sensing lines and\nthe driving lines cross, there will be a specific electrostatic field, which is registered as\nneutral by the processor in your smartphone or computer. But that all changes when something conductive\ncomes along and touches it -- like your finger. See, the human body has a natural capacitance,\nwhich means our bodies can conduct electric current, and can store electric charge. So when your finger touches the screen, the\ncharge in the screen is drawn around that point, distorting that electrostatic field. The electricity doesn’t actually /flow/\nthrough your finger. Basically, the electrostatic field feels the\neffects of your electric charge and redistributes itself accordingly. Even really small changes are detected by\nthe processor, which can then interpret the patterns you’re making – whether it’s\na tap or a slide. Because the lines of the grid are so thin,\ncapacitive touchscreens are super accurate, and some versions can process multiple touches\nat a time. But they won’t work if you have gloves on\n-- because the cloth isn’t conductive, unless your gloves have those special fingertips\nwith metal fibers inside. Plus, something like sweat can affect how\nelectricity is conducted across the screen, because it’s full of salts. It’s all about the materials that can affect\nthe electrostatic field generated inside your screen. So next time you’re texting on a smartphone\nor scrolling through internet forums on a tablet, just remember: you’re actually a\npart of the electronics making it work.

{"page": 27, "lesson": 11, "title": "How architecture can create dignity for all", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/b8nSXz2Z", "transcript": {"en": "On a beautiful day, just a few years ago my wife and I entered a hospital near our home in Oakland, California for the birth of our first daughter, Maya. We had responsibly toured\nthe birthing center in advance and yet we were somehow\nstill startled to find ourselves in the place where we would experience one of the most significant\nmoments of our lives. We were stuck in a windowless room with no hint of the bright\nand sunny day that we had left. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, the paint on the walls was beige and machines beeped inexplicably as a wall clock indicated\nday turning to night. That clock was placed above a door in direct line of sight to where my wife lay as her contractions\nincreased hour after hour. Now, I've never given birth -- (Laughter) but she assured me that the last thing\nthat a birthing woman would ever want is to watch the seconds tick by. (Laughter) An architect by training,\nI've always been fascinated watching people experience design\nin the world around them. I believe design functions\nlike the soundtrack that we're not even\nfully aware is playing. It sends us subconscious messages\nabout how to feel and what to expect. That room that we were in\nseemed completely misaligned with the moment\nthat we were experiencing -- welcoming a human being, our daughter, into this world. At one point a nurse, without any prompt, turned to us and said, \"I always think to myself, 'I wish I had become an architect, because I could have designed\nrooms like this better.'\" I said to her, \"An architect did design this room.\" (Laughter) Despite the immense joy\nof our daughter's birth, the messages of that hospital room\nstick with she and I to this day. Those messages are, \"You are not at home, you are in a foreign place.\" \"You are not in control of anything. Not even the lighting.\" \"Your comfort, simply, is secondary.\" At best, a hospital room like this might just be described\nor dismissed as uninspiring. At worst, it is undignifying. And I use it to point out that none of us, anywhere in the world, are immune from bad design. I went into architecture\nbecause I believed it was about creating spaces for people\nto live their best lives. And yet what I found\nis a profession largely disconnected from the people most directly\nimpacted by its work. I believe this is because\narchitecture remains a white, male, elitist profession -- seemingly unconcerned with some of the greatest\nneeds in the world or even the relatively simple needs\nof an expectant mother. Students are trained in school using highly theoretical projects, rarely interacting with real people\nor actual communities. Graduates are funneled\nthrough a long, narrow unforgiving path to licensure. Meanwhile, the profession\nholds up a select few through relentless award programs focused almost exclusively\non the aesthetics of buildings, rather than the societal impact\nor contributions of them. It only goes to reinforce a warped view of professional responsibility and success and yet this isn't\nwhy so many young, hopeful people go into architecture. It's not why I did. I believed then, though I didn't\nhave a language for it, and I know now, that design\nhas a unique ability to dignify. It can make people feel valued, respected, honored and seen. Now I'd like for you to just think\nabout some of the spaces that you inhabit. And I'd like to have you think\nabout how they make you feel. Now, there are places\nthat make us feel unhappy, unhealthy or uninspiring. They may be the places that you work or where you heal or even where you live. And I ask, how might these places\nbe better designed with you in mind? It's a really simple question and it can somehow, sometimes\nbe very difficult to answer. Because we are conditioned\nto feel like we don't have much agency over the spaces and places\nthat we live, work and play. And in many cases we don't. But we all should. Now, here's a potentially dumb question\nfor any women watching: Have you ever stood in a disproportionately long\nbathroom line? (Laughter) Did you ever think to yourself,\n\"What is wrong with this picture?\" Well, what if the real question is, \"What is wrong with the men\nthat designed these bathrooms?\" (Applause) It may seem like a small thing, but it's representative\nof a much more serious issue. The contemporary world\nwas literally built by men who have rarely\ntaken the time to understand how people unlike them experience their designs. A long bathroom line\nmight seem like a minor indignity. But the opposite can also be true. Thoughtful design\ncan make people feel respected and seen. I've come to believe\nthat dignity is to design what justice is to law and health is to medicine. In the simplest of terms, it's about having the spaces you inhabit\nreflect back your value. Over the past two years I had the opportunity to interview\nover 100 people from all walks of life about their experience of design. I wanted to test my hunch that dignity and design\nare uniquely related. I listened to Gregory, a resident of this cottage community designed specifically for the 50 most chronically\nhomeless people in Dallas. Gregory had been living on the streets, drifting from town to town\nfor over 30 years. A broad coalition of social service agencies, funders and designers, created this place. Each 400 square foot cottage\nis designed beautifully as a permanent home. Gregory now has a key to a door to his own house. He describes the sense\nof security that it brings him. Something he had lived without\nfor three decades. When he arrived with little more\nthan the clothes on his back, he found everything: from a toaster, Crock-Pot and stove to a toothbrush and toothpaste\nawaiting for him. He describes it simply as heaven. On the other side of the world, I listened to Antoinette, the director of this\ntraining and community center for women in rural Rwanda. Hundreds of women\ncome to this place daily -- to learn new skills, be in community, and continue rebuilding their lives following the country's civil war. These women literally pressed the 500,000 bricks that make up the 17\nclassroom pavilions like this one. Antoinette told me, \"Everyone is so proud of it.\" And then back here in the US I listened to Monika, the director of a free clinic primarily serving\nthe uninsured in Arkansas. Monika loves telling me that the doctors, who volunteer at her free clinic routinely tell her that they've never worked\nin such a beautiful, light-filled place. Monika believes that even people experiencing poverty deserve quality health care. And what's more, she believes they deserve\nto receive that care in a dignified setting. People like these are invaluable\nambassadors for design and yet they are roundly absent\nfrom architectural discourse. Similarly, the people who can\nmost benefit from good design often have the least access to it. Your cousin, a homeless veteran; your grandma or grandpa who live in a house with a kitchen\nthat's no longer accessible to them; your wheelchair-bound sister in a suburban area\nplanned without sidewalks. If good design\nis only for a privileged few, what good is it? It's time designers change this by dedicating their practices\nto the public good in the model of firms like Orkidstudio, Studio Gang and MASS Design Group. Their clients are orphaned children in Kenya, foster children in Chicago and pregnant women in Malawi. Their practices are premised on the belief that everyone deserves good design. Dedicating more practices\nto the public good will not only create\nmore design that is dignifying, but it will also\ndignify the practice of design. It will not only diversify\nthe client base of design, but it will also create new,\nmore diverse forms of design for the world. Now, in order to do this, my architecture and design friends,\nespecially my fellow white guys, we must simultaneously\nand significantly diversify our ranks. If we want the public to believe\nthat design is for them and for everyone. Today, barely 15 percent of registered architects\nin the United States are women. And a far smaller percentage\nare persons of color. Other professions, like law and medicine had made far greater strides\nin these crucial areas. How might our shared built environment -- our homes, our hospitals,\nour schools, our public spaces -- be shaped differently if women and people of color were behind half\nof the proverbial blueprints? It is not a question of whether, but to what extent our buildings, our landscapes, our cities and our rural communities are less beautiful, less functional, less equitable and less dignifying because women and people of color\nare less likely to be creating them. As Winston Churchill\nfamously noted in 1943 when he called for the rebuilding of London's war-damaged\nparliamentary chambers, \"We shape our buildings,\nand afterward, they shape us.\" The good news is\nthat we can change how we build and who we build for. Be that a health worker in rural Rwanda, or a birthing mother and nervous\nnew father in the United States. We can do this\nby recommitting architecture to the health, safety\nand welfare of the public. This will pay dividends. Because once you see what design can do, you can't unsee it. And once you experience dignity, you can't accept anything less. Both become part of your possible. One of my favorite conversation partners\nis my 90-year-old grandmother, Audrey Gorwitz, from Oshkosh, Wisconsin. After one of our\nconversations about design, she wrote me a letter. She said, \"Dear Johnny, I thought the other day,\nas I sat in my doctor's office, how depressing it was, from the color on the wall,\nto the carpet on the floor. (Laughter) Now I will have to call to see who is responsible\nfor the drabness in that place.\" (Laughter) In the same letter, mind you, she said, \"I did call, and I got the man in charge, and he said he appreciated\nsomeone calling him. My doctor's office\nis now on the list for an upgrade.\" (Laughter) She signed it by saying, \"It is always good\nto express one's opinion if done in a proper manner.\" (Laughter) (Applause) I love my grandma. (Laughter) Like my grandma Audrey, you deserve good design. Because well-designed spaces are not just a matter of taste\nor a questions of aesthetics. They literally shape our ideas\nabout who we are in the world and what we deserve. That is the essence of dignity. And both the opportunity\nand the responsibility of design for good and for all. Thank you.

{"page": 27, "lesson": 12, "title": "Why can't you divide by zero?", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-can-t-you-divide-by-zero", "transcript": {"en": "In the world of math, many strange results are possible \nwhen we change the rules. But there’s one rule that most of us \nhave been warned not to break: don’t divide by zero. How can the simple combination \nof an everyday number and a basic operation \ncause such problems? Normally, dividing by smaller \nand smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking \nall the way down to zero, the answer will grow \nto the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10 \ndivided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is \nthat if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as\nsaying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look \nat what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, \"How many times must \nwe add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially \nthe reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number \nby a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number \nwe can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called \nthe multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply \nthree by two to get six, you can then multiply \nby one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse \nof two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse \nof 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any\nnumber and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find \nits multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that\nmultiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied\nby zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians \nhave broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking \nthe square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined \nthe square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new\nmathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity \nmeans one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know \nanything about infinity already. Based on the definition \nof a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus\nzero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation \ncan be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero \nis definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined \nthis as equal to one, while the other side of the equation \nis still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, \nthat's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true \nin our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could\nbe mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number \nwere equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful \nto mathematicians, or anyone else.

Our numbers have skyrocketed, from 1 billion in 1800, to 2.3 billion in 1940, 3.7 billion in 1970, and 7.4 billion in 2016. The world population increased fourfold in the last century, so what can we expect for the next century? And what does population growth mean for our future? Will there be mass-migration? Overcrowded slums and megacities covering continents? Diseases and pollution? Chaos and violence over energy, water, and food? And a human species focused only on sustaining itself? Will population growth destroy our way of life? Or is this prophecy just ungrounded panic? In the 1960s population growth reached an unprecedented rate. Which lead to apocalyptic prophecies. The poor would pro-create endlessly and overrun the developed world. The legend of overpopulation was born. But it turns out high birth rates and the population explosion are not permanent features of some cultures or countries, But rather a part of a four step process the whole world is going through, The demographic transition. Most developed countries have already made the transition, while other countries are doing it right now. Let's go back to the 18th century, when the entire world, including Europe, was in the first stage of the demographic transition. By today's standards, Europe was worse off, than a developing region, suffering from poor sanitation, poor diets, and poor medicine. A lot of people were born, but lots of them died just as fast, so the population hardly grew. Women had between 4 and 6 children, but only 2 of them would reach adulthood. Then the industrial revolution happened in the UK and bought the greatest change in human living conditions since the agricultural revolution. People went from being peasants to workers. Manufactured goods were mass produced and became widely available. The sciences flourished and advanced transportation, communication, and medicine. The role of women in society shifted and created the conditions for their emancipation. Slowly this economic progress not only formed a middle class, but also raised standards of living and health care for the poor working population. The second transition stage started. Better food supplies, hygiene and medicine, meant people stopped dying all the time, especially so, at a very young age. The result was a population explosion. Doubling the UK's population between 1750 and 1850. The main reasons families used to have lots of children was that only a few of them were likely to survive. Now that had changed, so the third stage of transition was set in motion. Fewer babies were conceived, and population growth slowed down. Eventually a balance emerged, fewer people were dying and fewer children were born, so the death rate and birth rate became stable. Britain had reached the fourth stage of the demographic transition. This didn't only happen in the UK, more and more countries went through the four stages. First, many births and many deaths due to bad living conditions. Second, better living conditions leading to fewer deaths and a population explosion. Third, fewer deaths resulting in fewer births, and population growth came to an end. But if birth rates have dropped so much, why is the population still growing so fast? Well, the children born in the population explosion of the 70s and 80s are having kids themselves now. Leading to a noticeable spike in overall population. But they are having far fewer children on average than their parents. The average today is 2.5, it was 5, 40 years ago. So as this generation gets older, and fertility declines further, the rate of population growth will keep on slowing. This is true for every country. In the west, we tend to overlook progress in other regions of the world. But actually most of the world's countries have made it to the fourth stage. Just look at Bangladesh. In 1971, the average woman had 7 kids, but 25% of them would die before the age of 5. In 2015, the mortality rate was down to 3.8% and women had only 2.2 kids on average. This is the rule, not an exception, we're not special, we just had a head start. It took developed countries about 80 years to reduce fertility from more than 6 children, to less than 3. Others are catching up fast. Malaysia and South Africa did it in only 34 years; Bangladesh took just 20. Iran managed it in 10 years. All these countries that are catching up didn't have to start from scratch and the more support they get, the faster they catch up. This is why programs that help lower child mortality or help poor nations develop, are so important, No matter what your motivation is, whether you dream of a world where all people live in freedom and wealth, or you just want fewer refugees coming into your country, The simple truth is, that it's beneficial to you personally if people on the other side of the globe can live a good life. And we are getting there, the percentage of people living in extreme poverty has never been as low as today. So the future of global population growth is not an apocalyptic prophecy, it's a promise! Population growth will come to an end. The UN forecasts that the 12th billionth human will never be born at all. And as the development level of the world rises, the number of people a higher education will increase tenfold. Countries who used to be a need, will help advance development instead. More people is going to mean more people able to advance our species.

One of them is the honey bee. One out of three meals eaten by humans\nis made possible by honey bees. They are so important that if all the\nhoney bees were to die out, thousands of plants would follow, which could lead to millions of people\nstarving in the following years. On top of that, honey bees have\na huge economic impact. The dollar value of plants\npollinated by them each year is around $265 billion. Food we take for granted would just\nstop existing without them, or there would be a massive\ndecrease in productivity. Food including apples, onions, pumpkins,\nand also plants used for feeding livestock and thus extremely important\nfor our milk and meat. Einstein is often quoted as having said, “If honey bees die out, humans\nwill follow a few years later.” Actually, he probably didn’t say that, but there might be some\ntruth in the statement. It’s unsettling, but honey bees\nhave started to disappear. Millions of hives have died\nin the last few years. Beekeepers all over the world have seen an\nannual loss of 30–90% of their colonies. In the US alone, bees\nare steadily declining. >From 5 million hives in 1988\nto 2.5 million today. Since 2006, a phenomenon called\n“colony collapse disorder” has affected honey bees in many countries. And we’re not entirely sure\nwhat’s causing it. All we know is that it’s pretty serious. Over the last few decades bees have seen\nan invasion of very dangerous foes. Parasites straight out of a horror movie,\nlike Acarapis woodi, microscopic mites that infect the tracheae\n(that’s the breathing tubes) of bees. Here, they lay their eggs and feed from\nthe fluids of their victims, weakening them considerably and spending\ntheir whole life inside the bees. Or Varroa destructor, a fitting name\nbecause they can only reproduce in honey bee hives and are one of\nthe bees’ greatest enemies. The female mite enters a honey bee brood\ncell and lays eggs on the bee larva before it’s about to pupate and before the hive bees cover the\ncell with a wax capping. The eggs hatch and the young mites and\ntheir mother feed on the developing bee in the safety of the capped cell. The bee is not normally killed\nat this stage, just weakened, so it still has enough strength to chew\nits way through the wax capping and release itself from the cell. As it does, it releases the mother mite\nand her new offspring from the cell, and these are free to\nspread across the hive, starting the process over again\nin a cycle of about 10 days. Their numbers grow exponentially,\nand after a few months, this can lead to the collapse\nof the entire bee hive. Once outside of the cell, adult mites\nalso suck the bodily fludis of bees and weaken them considerably. To make things worse, they also transmit\nviruses that harm the bees even more and can lead to birth defects\nlike useless wings. But there are other threats too,\nsuch as viruses and fungi. Under normal circumstances, these\nphenomena should be manageable and are not enough to explain the horrendous amount of\ndying going on in bees. Over recent years new insecticides\nhave been introduced that are deadly to bees. Neonicotinoids, a chemical family\nsimilar to nicotine, was approved in the early 1990s\nas an alternative to chemicals like DDT. They attack insects by harming\ntheir nervous systems. Today, they are the most widely\nused insecticides in the world. Globally, they saw sales\nof €1.5 billion in 2008, representing 24% of the global\nmarket for insecticides. In 2013, neonicotinoids were used in the\nUS on about 95% of corn and canola crops, and also on the vast majority\nof fruit and vegetables, like apples, cherries, peaches, oranges,\nberries, leafy greens, tomatoes, potatoes, cereal grains, rice, nuts,\ngrapes, and many more. Bees come into contact with the toxin while collecting pollen or\nvia contaminated water, often bringing material into the hive, where it can accumulate and\nslowly kill the whole colony. The toxins harm bees in a\nvariety of horrible ways. In high enough doses, it quickly leads\nto convulsions, paralysis, and death. But even in small doses, it can be fatal. It may lead to bees forgetting\nhow to navigate the world, so bees fly into the wild, get lost, and\ndie alone, separated from their hives. If this happens often enough, a hive\ncan lose its ability to sustain itself. We know that neonicotinoids\nare harmful to bees and that we urgently need\nan alternative to it, but there are billions of dollars\nto be made in delaying this. Studies sponsored by the chemical\nindustry magically appear to prove a much lower toxicity to bees, compared to\nthose produced by independent scientists. There are even more factors\ncontributing to the demise of bees, like too much genetic uniformity,\ncrop monocultures, poor nutrition due to overcrowding,\nstress because of human activities, and other pesticides. Each of those factors on its own is\na major problem for bees, but together, they probably account\nfor colony collapse disorder. With parasites upping their\ngame in recent decades, the honey bees are now\nfighting for survival. It would be a catastrophe\nif they lost this fight. This is a conundrum we have to solve\nif we want to continue living with a relative abundance\nand diversity of food. Humanity is deeply interconnected with\nEarth and the other lifeforms on it, even if we pretend that we’re not. We have to take better care\nof our surroundings, if not to preserve the beauty of nature,\nthen at least to ensure our own survival.

Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You won't believe your eyes. You've heard this before right? It's usually like a click bait title to get you to watch an internet video or read a stupid article. But are there cases when you actually can't believe your eyes? Make this video as large as you can on the screen that you're watching and we're gonna do an experiment. Put your head at a set distance from the screen and look at this photo. It's a lighthouse on top of an island but I've inverted the colors. I want you to focus your eyes right on the tip of that lighthouse and don't move them. I'm gonna be quiet now and I'm gonna let you transport your mind to this island off the coast of Tasmania. [ seagulls ] OK I'm about to invert the picture back but I want you to stay focused on that lighthouse. Are you ready? Here we go. Out of the corner of your eye you should see a pale blue sky and a deep royal blue sea with little light green grass spots on the island. Now, take your eyes and move it to the edge of the island. You see that? There is no color in this picture. It's a black and white image. Your brain just made up color that wasn't there. Can you believe your eyes? By the way, just in case you're curious this is what the original image looked like. OK, so I just showed you a black and white image and for some reason your brain saw something like this. What is happening? Is that something going on with your eye? Or is that your brain? For all we know it might be the optic nerve connecting the two. Let's investigate a little bit further. A couple of years ago I saw this video on the internet and at first it just looks like a neat little light toy. But my mind saw something way different. I realized for the first time that I literally could not believe my eyes. Not that I didn't understand what was happening, but I knew that what I was seeing didn't actually exist. As soon as I saw this video it was very clear to me that the dude that made this was a genius. The bad news is though, he lives hundreds of miles away in the desert. So I'm in a kind of a sleazy hotel and uh, I don't want to say sleazy. Have you ever seen somebody do something really cool on the internet and you wanted to meet them? Well that's kinda what happened here. This is Greg. - Hello - And Greg has a pretty interesting gadget that you made? Is that what we're gonna call it? - That's what we're gonna call it. The device. - Did you design this PCB? - I did. - Did you populate it? - I did. That's a lot of small chips on there, but.. - You're a geek man. - Yeah I know. [laughs] It gets easier. - How long did it take to populate the board? - It takes about an hour and a half. - You did that whole thing in an hour and a half? - Yeah. - Yeah but can you change a water pump on a 1990 Chevrolet pickup? - [laughs] - So those are LEDs right? - Yeah they're red green blue RGB LEDs. - That's pretty cool. Now how are you controlling that? - So these LEDs are mounted on a circuit board that's mounted on a DC motor. And if I apply power to the DC motor, it spins. And if I time it just right, I can essentially light up any LED anywhere on the circle that I want, as we can see here. - So you just created these bitmaps and then uploaded them through some software that you wrote? - Yep, so this is a 63 by 63 pixel bitmap, and essentially I take that and there's actually an infrared sensor on the display that can receive data. - Oh look at that. Smarter Every Day. Little homage. So how did you do that? Did you upload that, or.. You did that today didn't you. - Yes actually I just created that image right before driving out to meet you. - This is pretty amazing. So ok, here's the deal. I asked you about this because I wanted to do this. I wanted to use this high speed camera to look at what you've got here. This is a Phantom Miro that we're using here. This is a Miro 320S, and we're gonna setup.. What's your update rate on the microcontroller? - Um it's pretty fast. It's spinning at about 25 revolutions every second. - Ahuh. - And within those it updates 256 times. So we're looking at about a 200 microsecond rate that the LEDs get updated. - OK so a thousand frames per second is not fast enough, is what you're telling me. - No. - OK. Alright, well let's figure out what frame rate we need to hit in order to understand what's going on here. - Alright. - What do we call these? Are these pixels? Cause it's not really like a square thing like cartesians, it's kinda like an arc.. - Right, it's kind of like an arc pixel. - OK, so what do you call that? - An arxel. - Arxel.. like it. We're gonna go with that. How far does the LED bar travel for each individual arxel as you call it? - It's about one and a half degrees. - If it's only going one to two degrees, then why is my brain still seeing that light the whole time it's around? Because it's only one 360th of the sweep, but the rest of it's dark. According to the high speed camera, which I had to crank up to 5500 frames per second, this is what's actually happening. Check it out. Those's dots, or the arxels as Greg likes to call them are kind of flipping around all over the place. Most of the image is dead space. So why is your brain making that image? To understand why the brain sees something that's not there I found a guy that studies this sort of thing that's published over 130 different papers on similar topics. OK I'm on a pretty bad Skype connection with Dr Stuart Anstis who is a genius at the University of California San Diego and what do you study Dr Anstis? - [british accent] I study visual perception, in particular visual illusions which tell us about the normal processes of vision, how the eyes send information to the brain. - That's fantastic. And obviously your accent makes it very clear that you know exactly what you're talking about because I would expect nothing less from a person who studies visual perception. So I want to understand why my eyeball is seeing something where I know there is not light. Why am I seeing that? - It's because of persistence of vision, which means the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. It's analogous to a camera where you have a long exposure time, and this will give you more light coming in, greater sensitivity, but you have a more sluggish response. So anything moving gets blurred out. - What is the difference in time from the moment the LED is illuminated until my eye registers that the light is there? There has to be a delay time there. What is that? - That delay time varies enormously, over a ten-fold range, anything from 10 to 100 milliseconds. - According to Dr Anstis there's two things going on, and let's look at it. Let's pretend that we have a flashing LED and we want to look at the brain's response to that LED. First of all he said there's a delay, so when the LED first comes on, our brain's not going to immediately see vision, it's gonna take some finite amount of time later. Secondly he said that the eye averages what it sees over a short period of time. Think about that. If we have a moving average, that means that our vision has some sort of inertia to it. It works like this. As the average comes along and is exposed to that LED flash, it starts to ramp up. As the light goes away, that moving average starts to ramp back down. As the light comes back that average starts to go up again, and instead of having gaps that are complete darkness, we have this nice trough in the bottom. Therefore we have a persistence of vision even though there is no light to see at that point in time. Let's look back at that slo mo image from before with all the blinking LEDs. Now, let's add this time average of light and see what the image looks like. Check it out. How cool is that? It looks just like what our eyes see. At what rate would you expect that I would quit seeing a uniform image but I would start to see like a tail dragging across the screen? - Well if the average time is less than one revolution then you're going to see a gap. But supposing as you say, the propellor goes around in 1/25th of a second, that's 40 milliseconds. - I get it now. Do you understand? Think about it. Greg's wheel is rotating at 25 frames per second, and that has to do with the moving time average of the human eye. That's why this video is at least 25, it's actually 30 frames per second. If it wasn't, you would see flickering of the image. So what seems like an imperfection in our eye is actually what smooths things out and makes the world work smoothly for us. That's pretty awesome. If the people watching this video were students in your class what would you want them to know about Greg's wheel and the persistence of vision? - [laughs] Well I would say every system has got a limited time resolution The eye has an engineering problem of trading time resolution against sensitivity to light. And in fact it's got sort of knobs inside which can change that trade-off relationship automatically. The eye is in many ways much cleverer than the camera. It's a beautiful piece of engineering. - Well thank you very much sir, I really appreciate your time. - Thank you. I hope you enjoyed this, feel free to subscribe, if not, no big deal. Hope you're getting Smarter Every Day Have a good one. OK is there any truth to the rumor that you actually proposed using one of these? - There is some truth. [laughs] As I was finishing up the project I thought to myself, Hey it'd be pretty cool if I could like write messages on here so I decided that's how I wanted to propose."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Persistence of vision is when the eye averages what it sees over a _____ period of time.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Short"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Long"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The YouTube video you are watching is ___ frames per second.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20"}, {"label": "B", "text": "25"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30"}, {"label": "D", "text": "60"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 27, "lesson": 17, "title": "Why are fish fish-shaped? - Lauren Sallan", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-incredible-evolution-of-fish-bodies-lauren-sallan", "transcript": {"en": "In tropical seas, flying fish leap out of the water, gliding for up to 200 meters \nusing wing-like fins, before dipping back into the sea. In the Indo-Pacific, a hunting sailfish can reach speeds \nof 110 kilometers per hour. That’s 11 times faster than Olympic \nswimming champion Michael Phelps. It can then stick up its spiny dorsal fin \nlike a brake, grinding to a dead halt, mid-swim. Each of these physical feats is made \npossible by a fish’s form, which in most species is a smooth, \nelongated body, fins, and a tail. These features are shared across thousands\nof fish species, each introducing its own variations on\nthe theme to survive in unique habitats. What makes these features so\ncommonplace in fish, and what does it reveal about the more \nthan 33,000 fish species that inhabit earth’s rivers, \nlakes, and seas? Fish can be split into two main groups, according to the type \nof motion they favor. The first is body \nand caudal fin driven motion, and most fish species, about 85%, \nfall into this group. Here, the body and tail \nare the primary propelling forces, with fins mainly playing \na stabilizing and steering role. This configuration suits \nmany open-water species, which need speed, thrust and control for\nconstant, efficient swimming. Eels lie at one extreme of this group. Known as anguilliform swimmers, their entire bodies undulate to generate \na wave-like motion. Compared to anguilliform fish, species like salmon and trout, \nknown as subcarangiforms, use about two-thirds of their body mass\nto generate motion, while carangiform swimmers, \nsuch as mackerel, only use about a third. Typically, the less of its mass a fish \nuses to generate motion, the more streamlined its shape. At the other end of the spectrum from eels\nare ostraciiform species like boxfish, and thunniform swimmers like tuna. In these fish, the tails, \nalso known as caudal fins, do the work. A tuna’s tail is attached by tendons \nto multiple muscles in its body. It powers the body like an engine, forcefully catapulting\nthe bullet-like fish to speeds up to 69 kilometers per hour. The second major fish group relies \non median and paired fin motion, meaning they’re propelled through the \nwater predominantly by their fins. Fins allow fine-tuned movement \nat slow speeds, so this propulsion \nis typically found in fish that have to navigate complex habitats. Bottom-dwelling fishes, like rays,\nfall into this group; using their huge pectoral fins, they can\nlift themselves swiftly off the sea floor. That conveniently allows them \nto inhabit shallow seas without being buffeted about by waves. Similarly, shallow-water flatfish \nuse their entire bodies as one big fin to hoist \nthemselves up off the sand. Ocean sunfish lack tails, so they move around slowly by beating \ntheir wing-like median fins instead. Similar movements are shared \nby many reef species, like the queen angelfish, surgeonfish, and wrasse. Their focus on fins has taken \nthe demand off their bodies, many of which have consequently \nevolved into unusual and inventive shapes. There are fishes within both groups \nthat seem to be outliers. But if you look closer, you’ll notice that these \ncommon traits are disguised. Seahorses, for instance, don’t appear \nfish-shaped in any conventional way, yet they use their flexible \ndorsal fins as makeshift tails. A pufferfish may occasionally \nlook more like a lethal balloon, but if it needs to swim rapidly,\nit’ll retract its spines. Handfish look like they have legs, but really these limb-like \nstructures are fins, modified to help them \namble across the sea floor.

With no chance of escape, you do what any courageous, \nself-respecting possum would do: curl into an immobile \nstate called catatonia, stick out your tongue, drool, and ooze some foul-smelling \nliquid from your anal glands. Disgusted, your assailant \nloosens its grip, decides you’re not the dinner \nit was looking for, and departs. After 10 minutes, \nyou resurrect and merrily saunter on. From lemurs to lizards, ants to amphibians, sharks to chickens, hundreds of animals\n\"play dead\" as a survival tactic. Nicknamed \"playing possum\" \nafter its star performer, feigning death is also called thanatosis. That’s from Thanatos, \nthe ancient Greek deity of death. But most scientists call it \ntonic immobility, or TI. How and why TI occurs depends \non the species and situation. Spewing stench and adopting odd postures\nare common and often play important roles. Other animals sacrifice their neighbors: quail chicks that freeze \nwhile their kin run amok have a better chance of survival \nwhen pursued by a cat. Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch\nthe napes of their kittens’ necks and induce another kind of \nimmobility called clipnosis. This keeps their kittens quiet \nand easy to transport. Most of the physiological mechanisms \nunderlying these theatrics originate in \nthe parasympathetic nervous system, better known for controlling cycles \nof resting and digesting. In possums, the parasympathetic nervous system causes\ntheir heart rates to drop by nearly half, respiration by a third, and body temperatures by more than half a\ndegree Celsius for up to an hour. The neurotransmitter dopamine \nalso plays a part. Flour beetles with low dopamine levels \nplay dead more frequently than those with high levels, and anything blocking dopamine receptor \nsites can lengthen catatonia. But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy. The performers are constantly \ngauging their surroundings for cues on when it’s safe to rise. Chickens, for instance, can sense\nwhen a predator’s eyes are upon them. Researchers know this because when they\nused a stuffed hawk in an experiment, their chicken subjects came out of their\ncatatonia quicker when the hawk’s eyes were averted. Other animals use TI for purposes \nother than defense. When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish, it sinks to the lake floor \nand lies motionless, its splotchy coloration making it \nseem like a rotting carcass. If a small scavenger investigates, \nthis undead trickster strikes. Some animals even feign death \nas a sexual ploy. Male nursery spiders offer gifts of\nsilk-wrapped insects in hopes of wooing females. But those females are known \nto eat love-seeking males. By playing dead while the female \neagerly devours her snack, these males can cautiously revive and improve their chances \nof successfully mating. So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,\nunless someone else knows its secret. California orcas can flip over \nyoung great white sharks, inducing TI for so long \nthe immobilized sharks, who must move to respire, \nessentially suffocate. Humans can also flip sharks into TI. By stroking a shark’s \nelectrically-sensitive snout and gently turning it over, researchers can induce TI \nthat lasts up to 15 minutes. That’s enough time to insert tags, remove hooks, and even perform surgeries. There are risks however: TI can hamper respiration and induce\nhyperglycemia, a sign of stress. So this technique should only \nbe used when necessary. Humans can also experience TI when they\nfreeze with fear during violent assaults. Recognizing this ancient, involuntary\nform of self-defense has significant implications \nwhen trying to understand why some victims don’t flee \nor fight in the face of danger. So, studying TI in non-human animals not only helps us better understand some\nodd behaviors, it can also help us better \nunderstand our own, sometimes counterintuitive, responses to violence."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Playing dead can be _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Used as a defense against predators who are attracted to movement"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Used as a lure to attract scavengers who can then be eaten as prey"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Used by male spiders to sidle up close to prospective female mates"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Playing dead is also known as _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hibernation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tonic immobility"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Narcolepsy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Halitosis"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Humans can place sharks into tonic immobility by _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stroking their snouts and flipping them over on their backs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Swinging a pendulum in front of their eyes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Squeezing their tails"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The length of time a chicken stays in tonic immobility depends on _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "What season it is"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The time of day"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whether or not a predator is staring at it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chickens have no control over how long they stay in tonic immobility"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Choose the true statement.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Animals with high dopamine levels play dead more frequently than those with low levels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When playing dead, the possum’s sympathetic nervous system causes the heart rate, respiration, and body temperature to drop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Playing dead is not a restful state and takes effort to maintain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sharks can place orcas into tonic immobility"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 27, "lesson": 19, "title": "What causes headaches? - Dan Kwartler", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-headaches-dan-kwartler", "transcript": {"en": "In ancient Greece, headaches were\nconsidered powerful afflictions. Victims prayed for relief from Asclepius,\nthe god of medicine. And if pain continued, a medical practitioner would perform \nthe best-known remedy— drilling a small hole in the\nskull to drain supposedly infected blood. This dire technique, called trepanation, often replaced the headache \nwith a more permanent condition. Fortunately, doctors today don’t resort \nto power tools to cure headaches. But we still have a lot\nto learn about this ancient ailment. Today, we’ve classified headaches \ninto two camps— primary headaches and secondary headaches. The former are not symptomatic of an\nunderlying disease, injury, or condition; they are the condition. But we’ll come back to them in a minute because while primary headaches \naccount for 50% of reported cases, we actually know much more \nabout secondary headaches. These are caused by other health problems, with triggers ranging \nfrom dehydration and caffeine withdrawal to head and neck injury, and heart disease. Doctors have classified \nover 150 diagnosable types, all with different potential causes, \nsymptoms, and treatments. But we’ll take just one common case \n—a sinus infection—as an example. The sinuses are a system of cavities that spread behind \nour foreheads, noses, and upper cheeks. When our sinuses are infected, our immune response heats up the area, roasting the bacteria and inflaming \nthe cavities well past their usual size. The engorged sinuses put pressure \non the cranial arteries and veins, as well as muscles in the neck and head. Their pain receptors, called nociceptors,\ntrigger in response, cueing the brain to release a flood \nof neuropeptides that inflame the cranial blood\nvessels, swelling and heating up the head. This discomfort, \npaired with hyper-sensitive head muscles, creates the sore, \nthrobbing pain of a headache. Not all headache pain comes from swelling. Tense muscles and inflamed, \nsensitive nerves cause varying degrees \nof discomfort in each headache. But all cases are reactions \nto some cranial irritant. While the cause is clear \nin secondary headaches, the origins of primary headaches \nremain unknown. Scientists are still investigating \npotential triggers for the three types of primary headaches: recurring, long-lasting migraines; intensely painful, \nrapid-fire cluster headaches; and, most common of all, \nthe tension headache. As the name suggests, tension headaches are known for creating \nthe sensation of a tight band squeezed around the head. These headaches increase the tenderness of\nthe pericranial muscles, which then painfully pulse \nwith blood and oxygen. Patients report stress, dehydration, \nand hormone changes as triggers, but these don’t fit \nthe symptoms quite right. For example, in dehydration headaches, the frontal lobe actually \nshrinks away from the skull, creating forehead swelling that doesn’t match the location \nof the pain in tension headaches. Scientists have theories \nfor what the actual cause is, ranging from spasming blood vessels to overly sensitive nociceptors, but no one knows for sure. Meanwhile, most headache research is\nfocused on more severe primary headaches. Migraines are recurring headaches, which \ncreate a vise-like sensation on the skull that can last from four hours \nto three days. In 20% of cases, these attacks are\nintense enough to overload the brain \nwith electrical energy, which hyper-excites sensory nerve endings. This produces hallucinations called auras, which can include seeing flashing lights and geometric patterns \nand experiencing tingling sensations. Cluster headaches, \nanother primary headache type, cause burning, stabbing bursts\nof pain behind one eye, leading to a red eye, constricted pupil, \nand drooping eyelid. What can be done about these conditions, which dramatically affect \nmany people’s quality of life? Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with \nover-the-counter pain medications, such as anti-inflammatory drugs \nthat reduce cranial swelling. And many secondary headache triggers, like dehydration, eye strain, and stress, can be proactively avoided. Migraines and cluster headaches \nare more complicated, and we haven’t yet discovered reliable \ntreatments that work for everyone. But thankfully, pharmacologists \nand neurologists are hard at work cracking these pressing mysteries \nthat weigh so heavily on our minds."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prescription medication"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Head massages"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Retail Therapy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anti-inflammatory drugs"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are the two general types of headaches?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Solo headaches and cluster headaches"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Primary and secondary"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Migraine and non-migraine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Long headaches and short headaches"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many types of secondary headaches are there?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "3"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Over 150"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What’s the most common type of primary headache?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Migraine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cluster"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tension"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "With migraines, auras are caused by ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hyper-excited nerve endings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Swelling"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dehydration"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spasming blood vessels"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Tension headaches and most secondary cases can be treated with ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prescription medication"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Head massages"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Retail Therapy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anti-inflammatory drugs"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

On any given day, many millions of people worldwide will be secretly turning the issue over in their minds\nas they go about their daily lives. Their partners beside them, possibly having little clue as to the momentous decision weighing upon them. The choice is perhaps more common now than it ever was We expect to be deeply happy in love, and, therefore, spend a good deal of time wondering whether our relationships are essentially normal in their sexual and psychological frustrations or are beset by unusually pathological patterns which will impel us to get out as soon as we can. What films or novels we've been exposed to, the state of our friends' relationships, the degree of noise surrounding new sexually driven dating apps, not to mention how much sleep we've had can all play humblingly large roles in influencing us one way or another. Awkwardly, it seems that no one else actually really minds what we end up doing which gives the decision a degree of existential loneliness it might not always have possessed Historically, the choice was, in a sense, a good deal easier because there were simply so many stern external sanctions around not leaving: religions would insist that god blessed unions and would be furious that they're being torn asunder, society strongly disapproved of breakups and cast separating parties into decades of ignominy and shame, and psychologists would explain that children would be deeply and permanently scarred by any termination in their parents' relationship But, one by one, these objections to quitting have fallen away; religions no longer terrify us into staying society doesn't care, and psychologists now routinely tell us that children would prefer a broken family to an unhappy one The burden of choice therefore falls squarely on us. The only thing determining whether to stay or leave is how we feel which can be pretty hard matter indeed to work out for ourselves, our feelings having a dispirited habit of shifting and evading any efforts of rational qualification. In the circumstances, it might help to have a set of questions, devil's advocate in nature, to fall back upon - a kind of checklist to dialogue within one's mind in the silent hours of the morning, from the chill vantage point of the spare room couch. How much of our unhappiness can be tightly attributed to this particular partner, and how much might it, as we would risk discovering five years and multiple upheavals later, turn out to be simply and inherent feature of any attempt to live in close proximity to another human? Though it is, of course, always essentially their fault, what tiny proportion of the difficulties might we, nevertheless, be contributing to the discord? In what modest way might we be a little hard to be around? Consider the annoying traits in all previous partners we've had and people we've known that our current partners happen not to have what do we manage not to fight about? Start to probe at any new infatuations or crushes, largely by getting to know them better Observe closely how many sexually available and intelligent people the single types around us, especially those hooked up to those new dating apps actually manage to encounter day-to-day. Try to have another converstaion with your partner in which you don't accuse them of mendacity, and instead simply explain, quite calmly, how you actually feel and how sad you are at quite a few things. Reflect on how'd you really feel as a child. If henceforth, you were to have two tiny bedrooms, two new step-parents, and possibly a few more new half-siblings. Compare with the scratchy reality of the current set up. Question how normal it is for any couple to have great sex after twenty-two months. Ask yourself if you're ready to face the risk of perhaps achieving no more than exchanging a familiar kind of unhappiness for a new and more complex variety of unhappiness.

{"page": 27, "lesson": 21, "title": "The difference between the United Kingdom, Great Britain and England explained", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/OC1XASxp", "transcript": {"en": "Welcome to the United Kingdom\n(and a Whole Lot More)\nexplained by me, C. G. P. Grey. United Kingdom?\nEngland?\nGreat Britain? Are these three the same place?\nAre they different places? Do British people secretly laugh those\nwho use the terms incorrectly?\nWho knows the answers to these questions? I do, and I'm going to tell you right now. For the lost — this is the world, this is the European continent, and this is the place we have to untangle. The area shown in purple is the United Kingdom. Part of the confusion is that the United Kingdom is not a single country, but is instead is a country of countries. It contains, inside of it —\nfour, co-equal, and sovereign nations. The first of these is England, shown here in red. England is often confused with the United Kingdom,\nas a whole, because it's the largest and most populous of the nations,\nand contains the de facto capital city, London. To the north is Scotland, shown in blue,\nand to the west is Wales, shown in white, and — often forgotten even\nby those who live in the United Kingdom —\nis Northern Ireland, shown in orange. Each country has a local term for the population. While you can call them all 'British,'\nit's not recommended;\nas the four countries generally don't like each other. The Northern Irish, Scottish, and Welsh\nregard the English as slave-driving, colonial masters (no matter that all three have their own, devolved, Parliaments; and are allowed to vote on English laws despite the reverse not being true), and the English generally regard the rest as rural, yokels who spend too much time with their sheep. However, as the four constituent countries\ndon't have their own passports, they're all British citizens, like it or not.\nThey are British citizens of the United Kingdom, whose full name, by the way, is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. So where's Great Britain hiding? Right here, the area covered in black is Great Britain. Unlike England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Great Britain is a geographical —\nrather than a political — term. Great Britain is the largest island\namong the British Isles. Within the United Kingdom,\nthe term 'Great Britain' is often used to refer to —\nEngland, Scotland, and Wales alone — with the intentional exclusion of Northern Ireland. This is mostly, but not completely, true, as all three constituent countries have islands\nthat are not part of Great Britain: such as the Isle of Wight (part of England),\nthe Welsh Isle of Anglesey, the Scottish Hebrides, the Shetland Islands,\nthe Orkney Islands, and the Islands of the Clyde. The second biggest island in the British Isles is Ireland. It's worth noting, at this point,\nthat Ireland is not a country; like Great Britain,\nit's a geographical — not political — term. The Island of Ireland contains, on it, two countries: Northern Ireland, which we have already discussed,\nand the Republic of Ireland. When people say they are 'Irish,'\nthey're referring to the Republic of Ireland (which is a separate country from the United Kingdom). However, both the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom are members of the European Union — even though England, in particular, likes to\npretend that it's an island in the mid-Atlantic, rather than 50 kilometers off the coast of France —\nbut that's a story for another time. To review: the two largest islands in the British Isles\nare Ireland and Great Britain. Ireland has, on it, two countries —\nthe Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland; while Great Britain, mostly, contains three:\nEngland, Scotland and Wales. These last three, when combined with Northern Ireland, form the United Kingdom. There are still many unanswered questions:\nsuch as, why, when you travel to Canada, is there British royalty on the money? To answer this, we need to talk about empire. You can't have gone to school, in the English-speaking world, without having learned that the British Empire once spanned 1/4th the world's land\nand governed nearly 1/4th the world's people. While it's easy to remember the parts of the\nBritish Empire that broke away violently, we often forget how many nations gained independence through diplomacy, not bloodshed. These want-to-be nations struck a deal with the Empire: where they continued to recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State, in exchange\nfor a local, autonomous parliament. To understand how they are connected,\nwe need to talk about the Crown. Not the physical crown — that sits behind glass in the Tower of London, and earns millions of tourist pounds for the UK — but the Crown as a complicated, legal entity, best thought of as a one-man corporation. Who created this corporation? God did. According to British tradition, all power is vested in God and the Monarch is crowned in a Christian ceremony. God, however, not wanting to be bothered with micromanagement, conveniently delegates his power his power to an entity called the Crown. While this used to be the physical\ncrown in the Tower of London, it evolved, over time, into a legal corporation; sole able to be controlled only by the ruling monarch. It's a useful reminder that the United Kingdom is still, technically, a theocracy: with the reigning monarch acting as both the Head of State and the Supreme Governor of the official state religion: Anglicanism. Such are the oddities that arise when dealing with a thousand year-old Monarchy. Back to Canada and the rest. The former colonies that gained their independence through diplomacy, and continue to recognize\nthe authority of the Crown, are known as the Commonwealth Realm.\nThey are, in decreasing order of population: Canada, Australia, Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, Jamaica, the Solomon Islands, Belize, the Bahamas, Barbados, Saint Lucia, \nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Tuvalu. All are independent nations, but still recognize the Monarchy as the Head of State (even though it has little\n real power within their borders). There are three further entities that belong to the Crown, and these are the Crown Dependencies:\nthe Isle of Man, Jersey, and Guernsey. Unlike the Commonwealth Realm, they are not considered independent nations, but are granted local autonomy by the Crown, and a British Citizenship by the United Kingdom (though, the UK does reserve the right to over-rule \nthe laws of their local assemblies). Are we all done 𝘯𝘰𝘸?\nAlmost, but not quite; there are still a couple of loose threads,\nsuch as this place: the tiny city of Gibraltar on the southern coast of Spain. Famous for its rock, \nits monkeys, and for causing diplomatic\ntension between the United Kingdom and Spain. But what about the Falkland Islands:\nwhich caused so much tension between the United Kingdom and Argentina, that they went to war over them. These places belong in the last group of Crown properties known as: British Overseas Territories, but their former name,\n'Crown Colonies,' gives away their origin. They are the last vestiges of the British Empire.\nUnlike the Commonwealth Realm, they have not become independent nations and continue to rely on the United Kingdom for military and, sometimes, economic assistance. Like the Crown Dependencies, everyone born within their borders is a British citizen. The Crown Colonies are,\nin decreasing order of population: Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Turks and Caicos Islands, Gibraltar, the British Virgin Islands, \nAkrotiri and Dhekelia, Anguilla, Saint Helena, the Ascension Islands, Tristan da Cunha, Montserrat, the British Indian Ocean Territory,\nthe South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands, the Falkland Islands, the British Antarctic Territory,\nand the Pitcairn Islands. For our final Venn diagram: the United Kingdom is a country situated\non the British Isles and is part of the Crown,\nwhich is controlled by the Monarchy. Also part of the Crown and the British Isles are the Crown Dependencies. The independent nations of the former Empire that still recognize the Crown are the Commonwealth Realm, and the non-independent remnants of the former Empire and are the British Overseas Territories.

Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million \nknown insect species in the world, but most have one of just \nfive common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter \nan unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it \njust by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all \nliving things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can\nhelp identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how \nit evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have \nstarted out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair \nof jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up \nand crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart \non ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets \nof the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of\na long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant \nor animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva \nwith digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order \nhave piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version \nof the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like \nstructure called a proboscis that works like a straw \nto suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled\nup tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when \nthey come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart,\nthere’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer \ntubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete \nenzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids \nand dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting \nmembers of the Diptera order are the only insects \nthat use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart \ninstead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart\nis a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like \nstructure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves \nare not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps,\nmembers of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools \nfor pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always \nexceptions to the rules.

Each one associated with a great European nation. The first originated in 17th century France, and became known as the \"Jardin à la française\" or \"formal French garden\". The most sublime example of this school of gardening is to be found in the chateau of Vaux-le-Vicomte which is about 50 kilometers southeast of Paris. It was laid out in the late 1650s by André le Nôtre the most important figure in the history of the French Garden. And the son of the gardener of Louis XIII. The idea was to arrange everything\naround symmetry, flattening the existing natural landscape so as to create\nperfect arrangements of borders, flower beds and reflecting pools. A grand perspective, a thousand five hundred meters long extended from the foot of the chateau to the end point: a statue of Hercules. The alleyways were decorated at\nregular intervals by statues, basins fountains and carefully sculpted\ntopiaries. It was in an extremely logical precise\nunyielding way perfect . Another masterpiece of French\ngardening was then constructed at Versailles also by André Le Nôtreto. Here to there was\nastonishing symmetry and a will to bend the unruliness of nature to the designs\nof man. The French gardening tradition achieved\nenormous popularity and was widely copied in far more modest homes across\nEurope for a century at least. But the dominance eventually gave way to a new theory of gardening that developed in England in the 18th century. And was known as the \"Jardin à l'anglaise\" or \"English Garden\". The central figure in\nthis tradition was Capability Brown, a gardener of genius responsible for a\n170 gardens up and down the United Kingdom, including Petworth in West Sussex, Chatsworth and Darbyshire Bowood in Wilshire and Blenheim Palace  in Oxfordshire. The Jardin à l'anglaise couldn't have been more different from the Jardin à la française. In the English tradition everything was about working with rather\nthan flattening natural features . Wildness of nature wasn't the enemy. It was the starting point which the\nskilled English gardener would enhance and work with. A good English garden\nrelish the raw impulses of nature it was about accommodating and\ndelighting in nature even though this was nature that was\ntampered with in order to get it to look just that bit more natural. The English garden usually included a\nlake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns and groves of trees. The English tradition reign supreme for\na century at least. These are two historical traditions of gardening but\nthey are also along the way two modes of being. The French style is about a\nconfident rationalism and willpower. This is how we might feel when we want\nto change the world through thought and planning. The English tradition is about\naccommodating ourselves to what already exists, bending with what is there, trying to\nmake the most out of what we've been given and to see its beauty and its charm. It looks like a battle but ideally we\nneed the two attitudes, the French and the English in our lives in order to\ncall upon them in diverse situations. Each of us is probably a bit biased\ntowards one or the other and could benefit from seeking out the distinctive\nwisdom of either the French or the English style. The opposition of the to\ngardening styles is stark but in truth we need integration, the Jardin à la française and the Jardin à l'anglaise, rational willpower and acceptance of\nnature. There are in fact a few places that do\nshow the two integrated like Sissinghurst Garden in Kent which\nborrows from both traditions. This shows us the model of how an ideal\nindividual might be, someone with a French and an English garden sight to\ntheir nature. Ready to call upon either faculty depending on the occasion. That would be interesting gardening and\nwise psychology."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which word is not a synonym for French gardens in the 17th century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Logical"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Precise"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Raw"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Symmetric"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "___ gardens have often reflected rational willpower, while ____ gardens have reflected the acceptance of nature.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "French, English"}, {"label": "B", "text": "English, French"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Most of the credit will go to the emperor, but this success wouldn’t \nhave been possible without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix. Servius enlisted as a legionary \neight years ago at age 18, the son of a poor farmer\nwith few prospects. Unlike the majority of legionaries,\nhe doesn’t gamble, so he’s been able to save \nmost of his wages. He’s even kept his viaticum, the three gold coins he received \nwhen he enlisted. If he survives until retirement, \nhe’ll receive several acres of land. And he’s grown rather fond \nof a girl back home whom he intends to marry. But he’ll have to wait until he completes \nhis 25 years of service before that can happen. And the life of a legionary \nis dangerous and grueling. Today, Servius’s legion, \nalong with three others, has undertaken a “great march” \nof 30,000 Roman paces, the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers. Servius’s armor and weapons, including his gladius, scutum, and two pila, weigh over 20 kilograms. And that’s not counting his backpack, \nor sarcina, which contains food and all the tools\nhe needs to help build the camp – spade, saw, pickaxe, and basket. Although Servius is exhausted, \nhe won’t sleep much tonight. He’s been assigned the first watch, which means looking after \nthe baggage animals and keeping alert\nagainst a possible ambush. After he’s done, he lies awake, \ndreading the day ahead, which will force him \nto recall his worst nightmare. At dawn, Servius eats breakfast \nwith his seven tent companions. They’re like a family, all bearing scars \nfrom the battles they’ve fought together. Servius is from Italia, but his fellow soldiers hail \nfrom all over the empire, which stretches from Syria to Spain. So they’re all far from home \nin the northern land of Germania. Servius’s legion \nand three others with him today are under the command of\nEmperor Tiberius’s nephew Germanicus, named for his father’s military successes\nagainst the Germanic tribes. Each legion has close to 5,000 men, divided into cohorts of about 500, further subdivided into centuries \nof around 80-100 men. Each century is commanded by a centurion. An aquilifer, or eagle-bearer, marches at\nthe head of each legion carrying its eagle standard. The centurions march beside \nthe legionaries belting out orders, “Dex, sin, dex, sin,\" “Right, left, right, left,\" starting with the right foot as the left \nis considered unlucky or sinister. Despite the strict discipline, \nthere’s tension in the air. Last year, some legions \nin the area revolted, demanding better pay \nand a cut in the length of service. Only their general’s charisma\nand negotiating skills prevented wholesale mutiny. Today is a “just march,” \nonly 30 kilometers. As the marshes and forests of Germania \nlie beyond the empire’s road system the men must build causeways\nand bridges to make headway— something they’ve recently spent \nmore time doing than fighting. Finally, they arrive at their destination,\na place Servius knows too well. It’s a clearing on the outskirts \nof the Teutoburg Forest, where six years ago, during the\nreign of the Emperor Augustus, Germanic tribes under \ntheir chieftain Arminius ambushed and destroyed three legions. Proceeding along a narrow path, the legions were attacked from \nforest cover under torrential rain with their escape blocked. It was one of the worst defeats \nthe Romans ever suffered and Augustus never lived it down. Servius was one of the few survivors. Servius still has nightmares of \nhis comrades lying where they fell. But now the army is back to bury \nthe dead with full military honors. As he helps in the task, he can’t help wondering whether the bones\nhe handles belonged to someone he knew. Several times he wants to weep aloud, \nbut he pushes on with the task. The glory of the Empire \ncan go to the crows. All he craves is to retire \non a small farm with his wife-to-be, if the gods should spare his life \nfor 17 more years."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "At what age did Servius retire?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "35"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40"}, {"label": "C", "text": "43"}, {"label": "D", "text": "45"}, {"label": "E", "text": "58"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who marches at the head of a Roman legion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tiberius"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Augustus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Germanicus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aquilifer, otherwise known as an eagle-bearer"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Centurion"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these items does Servius not carry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pickaxe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Basket"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lunchbox"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dagger"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Spear"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does Servius want to do when he retires?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gamble"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Invest his money"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Meet the emperor"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Write his memoirs"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Become a farmer"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What is the name of the victorious German commander?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Germanicus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tiberius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Arminius"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Augustus"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Varus"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
