Whitesides", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-growing-megafire-crisis-and-how-to-contain-it-george-t-whitesides", "transcript": {"en": "My wife grew up in Santa Rosa, California, and her best friend\nwas a woman named Joy Durand who lived on the northeast\noutskirts of town. At midnight on the evening\nof October 8, 2017, Joy's telephone rang. The voice said simply, \"You must evacuate now. You don't have time to pack. Fire is coming.\" Joy gathered her parents\nand her six-year-old son, and they hurried outside. The wildfire, which at that point\nwas just over the ridge from Joy's house, sounded like a jet engine\ngoing at full throttle. The family got in their car, drove away, and within minutes,\ntheir home had burned to the ground, incinerated by the blowtorch flames\nof the Tubbs Fire. All night long, my wife got texts\nand messages from friends and family, and while we didn’t know\nthe whole situation, it was clear that a disaster\nwas unfolding in her hometown. No one thought that fire could penetrate\nso deeply into the city. But on that evening, 22 people lost their lives and over five thousand homes\nand structures were destroyed. Wildfire is a large and growing challenge\nto the West and to the world. What happened in Santa Rosa\nis becoming all too common. Paradise in 2018, Australia in 2020,\nEurope in 2022. And fire experts say that we should get ready\nfor more Santa Rosas because it's likely to get worse\nbefore it gets better. Now beyond the major costs in lives and property and the economy, there's also a big\ncarbon impact to wildfire. In fact, the additional carbon\nfrom California's 2020 wildfires was greater than the carbon that Californians had worked\nso hard to save over the previous two decades. The largest fires are called megafires. These are the ones\nthat burn over 100,000 acres with the intensity that can threaten\naquifers and biodiversity, and even cause forest conversion, in which trees are so damaged\nthat they just don't grow back. These fires are getting worse as well. In fact, eight of the ten\nlargest megafires in California history have happened\nover just the last five years. Many people feel overwhelmed\nby this situation. I know I did. So two years ago,\nworking with great people, I closed a chapter\nof my life in aerospace and I started a new journey to see if I could understand\nthe wildfire crisis better and what could be done about it. I started working with leaders\nfrom firefighting and philanthropy, entrepreneurship,\nscience, tribal communities, and together we cofounded an organization\ncalled Megafire Action, whose sole purpose\nis to solve the megafire crisis. And I've come to believe\nthat if we take a holistic approach, we have an opportunity\nto establish a new relationship with fire, to work safely with fire and potentially to solve\nthis wicked problem. The path forward has three solutions. The first is fire-adapted communities, the second is resilient landscapes and the third is\ninnovative fire management. So for the first,\nfire-adapted communities, what we need to do is to clear the brush\nand the vegetation from homes, from the immediate proximity of homes. Next, we need to\nuse fire-resistant materials in the homes and the roofs. And then the third thing\nis to, where possible, protect against embers, flying embers, by protecting the home from openings\nlike your air vents and your chimneys. Now communities have\na strong shared interest to perform this work along\nthe exterior boundary of the community because it reduces the chance that fire will penetrate\ndeeply into the city, as it did in Santa Rosa. The second solution\nis resilient landscapes. And if you take one lesson\nfrom this talk, it's this. In order to solve the megafire crisis, we need to bring our western landscapes\nback into a healthy balance by reducing the overgrown brush and trees\nin the wildlands and the forest. Here we're finally starting\nto take to heart the wisdom of the Indigenous peoples of the Americas who knew that fire was\na natural part of the landscape and who introduced low-intensity fire,\ngood fire, on a regular basis, at the right times. When this is done well, as around the communities\nof South Lake Tahoe, then it can actually divert a megafire as bad as the one\nthat they experienced in 2021. It can also potentially prevent\na megafire from occurring, which is what some people think\nhappened in Napa of last year. But the scale of this challenge is huge. There are hundreds of millions of acres\nof wildland in the American forests. The Forest Service\nhopes to reduce the risk on 50 million high-priority acres\nover the next ten years. But the challenge is that they're only\naccomplishing a few million acres a year. And so we're not at the pace or scale that we need to do\nto address this challenge. So what do we need to do? Well, the first thing that we need to do is to essentially hire,\ntrain and retain many more workers who will be doing the hard work\nof defusing the time bombs inside our western forests. We need to pay them well. We need to support them\nwith full-time work and we need to protect them\nfrom liability where necessary. The next thing we need to do\nis to empower them with innovation. And right now there are\nan incredible number of great companies and organizations that are working\nto bring this innovation to reality. Just one of these companies\nis called BurnBot, and what they're hoping to do is to make controlled burns\nsafer and faster. They're going to establish\na burned perimeter around an area with the remotely piloted rover and then they can bring a drone\ninto the middle of it, drop some fire into it\nand burn that interior area safely. It's a brilliant but a simple idea. And I think we're going to need\na lot more of this kind of innovation if we're going to scale up\nto the to the size of the problem that we have before us. Now the first two solutions\nthat I've talked to you about are pretty well agreed. The third one, innovative fire management,\nis somewhat more controversial, but I think it offers huge potential\nto address and solve the wildfire problem. What we need is innovation and technology\nthat can rapidly detect and assess fire and then quickly put it out\nwhen it gets bad. And here, speed is paramount, because when you're\nin the worst kind of fire days -- these are the hottest,\ndriest and windiest fire days -- if you can't bring fire management\nresources to a fire very quickly, then it is likely that you\nwon't be able to contain that fire. Here we need to look at the example of the Quick Reaction Force\nof Southern California, which is really designed\nin some ways for these toughest days. The QRF is a public-private partnership, which now has three Chinook helicopters. These are the big ones\nwith the two rotors on the top. And each of them can drop\nup to 3000 gallons of water on a fire, day or night, and they can do it very precisely. They can also refill\nup to six times an hour so they can bring\na lot of mass to the problem. Over the course of two years\nof demonstrations, the QRF has demonstrated\nthat this model has great potential, that, in fact, if you can bring\na lot of fire management resource to a fire very quickly, you can get on top of fires\nbefore they get big and unmanageable. And this opens up\nan exciting potential future. Imagine this model\nwith a series of larger drone vehicles distributed across the landscape\nin higher-fire-risk areas. Imagine these vehicles\npositioned periodically along utility lines or in areas of higher fire-risk\ndeep in the forest. Such a distributed network,\nif connected to the right sensor system, could offer a future in which we are able\nto really put out fires on the worst fire days,\nand even in remote communities. Companies like Rain and Joby Aviation\nare working on this vision today. The sensor system\nwill also be very important for the resolution of this problem. The system -- which will entail both ground-based,\naerial and space-based platforms -- won't be important just because\nwe're going to be able to see and detect fire where and when it pops up, but also because it'll enable us to differentiate\nbetween good and bad fire, low-intensity fire\nand high-intensity fire, which is very important because we need\nmore lower-intensity fire on the landscape to rejuvenate our forests, just as much as we need to know where and when fire risk\nis becoming higher intensity. Fire is a prism through which\nwe can see the future of humanity's relationship\nwith natural systems. Working together\nand supported by technology, we can build a world in which communities\nare resilient to wildfire and in which forests\nare brought back into a healthy balance. Ultimately, we can build a future, in which we don't just manage fire\nto protect human life and property, but also to protect the biosphere\nfor global carbon emissions and for biodiversity. Ultimately, we need to become\nthe crew of Spaceship Earth. So let's get to work. Let's learn from fire and let's build a resilient,\nsustainable future. Thank you.

{"page": 103, "lesson": 2, "title": "Science vs. Pseudoscience - Siska De Baerdemaeker", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/science-vs-pseudoscience-siska-de-baerdemaeker", "transcript": {"en": "In the late 1700s, a German doctor named\nSamuel Hahnemann began publishing articles about a new treatment\napproach he called homeopathy. Hahnemann’s theory had\ntwo central hypotheses. First, the treatment for an ailment\nshould be a dose of something that might cause that ailment. And second, diluted medicines are more\npowerful than concentrated ones. So, a homeopathic remedy for insomnia might include an extremely diluted\nsolution of caffeine. Over the following 300 years, numerous physicians and patients\nturned to homeopathy, and entire hospitals were built\nto focus on homeopathic treatments. But despite all this, many studies have\nshown that homeopathy has no therapeutic effect, and homeopathic treatments often\nperform no better than placebos. So why do so many practitioners\nand institutions still support this practice? The answer is that homeopathy\nis a pseudoscience— a collection of theories, methods,\nand assumptions that appear scientific,\nbut aren’t. In the worst cases, pseudoscience\npractitioners encourage this confusion to exploit people. But even when they’re well-intentioned, pseudoscience still prevents people\nfrom getting the help they need. So how are you supposed to tell what’s\nscience and what’s pseudoscience? This question is known as\nthe demarcation problem, and there's no easy answer. Part of the issue is that defining\nscience is surprisingly tricky. There's a common idea that all science\nshould, in some form or another, be related to testing\nagainst empirical evidence. But some scientific activities\nare primarily theoretical, and different disciplines\napproach empiricism with varying goals, methodologies,\nand standards. 20th century philosopher Karl Popper\ntried to solve the demarcation problem with a simple rule. He argued that in order\nfor a theory to be scientific it must be falsifiable,\nor able to be proven wrong. This requires a theory to make\nspecific predictions— for example, if you’re theorizing\nthat the Earth revolves around the Sun, you should be able to predict the path of\nother celestial bodies in the night sky. This could then be disproven\nbased on whether or not your prediction corresponds\nto your observations. Popper’s falsification criterion \nis a great way to identify pseudoscientific fields\nlike astrology, which makes overly broad predictions\nthat adapt to any observation. However, falsification alone doesn't\ncompletely solve the demarcation issue. Many things we now consider science\nwere once untestable due to a lack of knowledge or technology. Fortunately, there are other factors\nwe can use to identify pseudoscience, including how a field responds\nto criticism. Scientists should always be open\nto the possibility that new observations could change\nwhat they previously thought, and thoroughly disproven theories should\nbe rejected in favor of new explanations. Conversely, pseudoscientific theories are\noften continually modified to explain away any contradictory results. This kind of behavior shows a resistance to what philosopher Helen Longino\ncalls transformative criticism. Pseudoscientific fields don't seek\nto address their internal biases or meaningfully engage\nin transparent peer review. Another key marker of science\nis overall consistency. Science relies on a network\nof shared information that ongoing research \ndevelops across disciplines. But pseudoscience often ignores\nor denies this shared pool of data. For example, creationists claim\nthat animals didn’t evolve from a common ancestor, and that Earth is\nless than 20,000 years old. But these claims contradict\nhuge amounts of evidence across multiple scientific disciplines, including geology, paleontology,\nand biology. While the scientific method\nis our most reliable tool to analyze empirical evidence\nfrom the world around us, it certainly doesn't reveal everything\nabout the human condition. Faith-based beliefs can play an important\nrole in our lives and cultural traditions. But the reason it’s so important\nto draw a line is that people often dress up\nbelief systems as science in efforts to manipulate others or undermine legitimate\nscientific discoveries. And even in cases where this\nmight seem harmless, legitimizing pseudoscience can impede\ngenuine scientific progress. In a world where it's increasingly\ndifficult to tell fact from fiction, it's essential to keep your critical\nthinking skills sharp. So the next time you hear\nan amazing new claim, ask yourself: could we test this? Are the individuals behind this theory\nupdating their claims with new findings? Is this consistent with our broader\nscientific understanding of the world? Because looking scientific\nand actually being scientific are two very different things."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does it mean to call something “pseudoscience”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is a more accessible, casual formulation of a well-known science."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is a different name for well-known science, like a pseudonym for an author."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It superficially appears to be scientific, but is not."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is the same as calling something science"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The question of how to distinguish science from pseudoscience is called ___ in philosophy of science.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The boundary problem"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The demarcation problem"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The debunking problem"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The science problem"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the main demarcation criterion proposed by philosopher Karl Popper?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Falsifiability"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Peer review"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Simplicity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The use of mathematics"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which discipline in the list below is not a pseudoscience?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Astrology"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Homeopathy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Creationism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Astronomy"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What set of features can help to distinguish science from pseudoscience?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Empirical testability, use of mathematics, openness to transformative criticism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Empirical testability, openness to transformative criticism, overall consistency"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Openness to transformative criticism, overall consistency, use of mathematics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Empirical testability, overall consistency, use of mathematics"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 103, "lesson": 3, "title": "How labor unions shape society - Margaret Levi", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-labor-unions-shape-society-margaret-levi", "transcript": {"en": "It's easy to imagine a world\nwithout labor unions. We're essentially living\nin that world now. And we are worse off as a result. Few of you probably belong to unions, but almost all of you benefit from them. It was unions that brought us the weekend. More importantly,\nunions built the middle class by ensuring that workers\nhad the incomes to support families, to buy homes and cars, and to dream that their children\ncould do better than they could. It was union power and advocacy\nthat helped us win Social Security and health insurance\nupon which almost all of us depend. In the 1950s, 33 percent of private-sector workers\nbelonged to unions. Big labor stood proudly\nbeside big business and big government. No more. Today, only six percent\nof private sector workers are members of unions. With their decline in numbers came\na decline in political and economic power. And the result? A significant increase in inequality. A significant deterioration\nin the possibility of a middle life -- A middle class lifestyle\nfor this generation or the next. And a receding chance to own\na home or afford retirement. We need unions to regain the power so that we can regain what we have lost, build a better future and help forge democracies that are built on a decent social contract\nbetween citizens and government and among citizens themselves. Yes, we need unions today as much as ever. As a professor of political science, and someone who has studied\nlabor unions for a long time, I can tell you that one of the most\nimportant things that unions do is to counterbalance\nthe power of corporations. They even the playing field. Yes, we need unions. But we need better and different unions that are more attuned to the 21st century. Let's picture the world before unions. Small children toiling all day\nand even into the night in noisy, polluted factories. Or immigrant women workers\njumping from a burning sweatshop because the fire escapes were locked so that they could not take breaks. That was New York City in 1911, that's Bangladesh now. But unions changed that by winning protections for workers. They transformed lives. They enabled even the worst off\nto achieve the American dream. Consider the longshore workers,\nthose who load and unload ships. In the morning, the boss came and yelled\nall along the shore -- thus the name longshore. They pleaded for the scarce jobs, just as migrant day laborers do today\nat places like Lowe's and Home Depot. It was humiliating, degrading. But when the unions won the right\nto organize and won contracts, the wharf rats became lords of the dock. They became middle class. They could marry. They could support families, they could send their children to college, they had health insurance and benefits. They had dignity, respect. They were full American citizens. Unions enabled others\nto attain the American dream by raising wages generally and by reducing wage disparities\nbetween men and women and among the races. My research has shown me that with every transformation\nin the economy, the technology, the way we work, there has been an evolution\nin the labor movement. Craft unions, think construction work\nor even beer making, emerged from medieval guilds. With the rise of industry --\nauto, steel -- new forms of organization emerged. When white collar workers in offices,\nin government, in health care in professions, won voice and representation, yet another kind of union developed. In my mind, in my ears, is Dolly Parton singing \"9 to 5\", inspired by a real-life\nunion of that name. When you hear that song, thank the unions for a decent working day. History shows that unions helped people\nget dignity, rise out of poverty, inhibit workplace dangers and harassment and improve health\nand well-being of us all. These are not yesterday's problems. Workers of today\nstill need and want unions. An MIT survey revealed that 50 percent\nof the non-union workforce would join a union if given a chance. So, Margaret, if unions are so great, why are they in such serious decline? Because the odds are stacked against them. Many of you have read\nabout the Amazon warehouse workers who failed to win a union\nrepresentation election in Alabama. They failed because of concerted\nemployer opposition. Indeed, there are many\nemployers and politicians who are preventing\nthe reform of labor laws passed nearly a century ago in another era and another economy. These are laws that inhibit agriculture and domestic\nworkers from organizing, largely Black and brown workers. They make it hard for workers\nin the gig economy to organize, those we call forth with our apps: rideshare, delivery service,\nspecialized tasks. There are employers and politicians\nwho are pushing states to pass “right-to-work” laws: laws that abolish the requirement that those who are covered by union\ncontracts have to pay union dues. This effectively kills the unions. Many workers in 27 states do not have to pay for the benefits\nthe unions provide for them. States that include Michigan,\nIndiana and Wisconsin, former union strongholds. And society loses big. A recent study revealed\nthat in right-to-work law states, there is slower economic growth, higher consumer debt, lower wages, worse health outcomes\nand lower civic participation than in states without such\nlaws on the books. But it's not just employers\nand politicians that are holding unions back. Unions are a cause\nof some of their own problems. Some unions are extremely bureaucratic, stifling debate and innovation. Some union leaders are corrupt. Rigging elections, paying themselves\nhumongous salaries, even when they represent\nvery low-income workers. And some commit felonies. Jimmy Hoffa is the notorious example\nof a labor leader who went to prison. But just this year, several high-ranking officials\nin the United Auto Workers were sentenced for embezzlement. Now, many critics, possibly some of you, blame unions for inflation. When wages go up, consumer prices go up. True enough, but so does the standard\nof living for workers. And we as taxpayers benefit from higher standards\nof living by workers. The pandemic gave us\nthe term \"essential workers.\" If those in grocery, warehousing,\nfood processing, delivery, had strong unions,\nindeed any unions at all, there would have been no need\nfor federal programs for those who have jobs to feed\ntheir families and prevent evictions. Now there are many reasons\nfor union decline, including structural ones. The decline in union jobs\nin manufacturing. But a major reason\nis public lack of awareness, even misinformation\nabout the value of unions. Well before President Reagan fired the striking\nair controllers in 1981, there has been concerted and continuous\nopposition by employers and politicians to undermine unions. Employers no longer suppress unions by hiring private armies, like US Steel, Ford\nand the coal companies did. Now they hire very high-priced\nconsulting firms to do that work. Elected officials may no longer\ncall out the police and the National Guard\nto cart labor organizers off to jail. Now they pass legislation that restricts\nunion organizing and power. But workers are beginning to fight back as the headlines reveal. They are building solidarity\nacross racial, ethnic, religious, partisan divides. Martin Luther King [Jr.] exhorted us\nto enwrap ourselves in a single garment of destiny. I have observed several unions\nthat I've studied build expanded and inclusive\ncommunities of fate in which large numbers of others recognize that their destinies are entwined despite differences and distances. This doesn't always happen, but it can and it must. If you took my class,\nor gave me another hour, I could give you numerous examples. We need as employees and citizens to build solidarity\nthrough communities of fate that crosses geographies and differences. But to do that, we need to reimagine\nlabor unions for now. The labor movement must evolve\nas it has in the past, even producing possibly alt unions,\nalternatives to unions. Alternatives to traditional unions. Workers in gig professions, tech, don't necessarily want\na traditional union, but they do want influence\nover their wages, working conditions and even the policies of their companies. And they are reimagining old approaches and coming up with new ones in order to build worker voice and power. Some are reconfiguring\nworker cooperatives: employee-owned businesses, in which the workers determine wages, working conditions and distribution of profits. This is not a pipe dream. Mondragon in Spain\nhas over 80,000 employee owners, takes in over 13 billion dollars a year and redistributes its profits\nto build worker skills and capacities among its member cooperatives. A newer approach is to use\nplatform technologies to teach workers their rights. In our global, hyperconnected\nand socially isolating world, platforms such as coworker.org or Unit recognize and address the fact\nthat there is a mobile workforce that no longer has\nwater coolers or lunch rooms around which to gather and strategize. These platforms provide workers\nwith a way to share experiences, access organizing resources and build networks at scale\nacross geographies and employers. Coworker.org had a huge win with Alphabet, the parent company of Google, a giant among tech firms. Alphabet workers recognize\nthat they are part of a community of fate that crosses large distances. They have been protesting\nGoogle's contracts with the Pentagon and with immigration authorities. They have normal run-of-the-mill\neconomic union demands, but they also have the political demand that they should have a say\nover company policies that affect them and us. Now, whatever you thought\nof unions in the past, I hope -- I hope that these examples\nhave revealed to you what they can be today and for tomorrow. Unions once significantly reduced\nincome inequality, the gap between the rich and the poor. They can again. These graph lines came together\nwhen unions rose. I'd like to see those lines\npermanently converge and inequality reduced once and for all. Billionaires are building\nrockets to explore outer space. This is so exciting, but equally exciting are the workers who are providing\nthe goods and services on which those billionaires\n[and] we all depend, exploring new ways\nto gain power and voice. If even some of these\nexplorations succeed, workers will gain dignity, economic security and the power to challenge\nemployers and politicians. The result? The resuscitation of the middle class and a far more equitable society. Thank you.

The enemy commander quickly awoke \nand gathered his men to launch a counterattack. But as soon as the defending army\nwas ready to fight, Hawkwood’s fighters simply turned\nand walked away. This wasn't an act of cowardice. These mercenaries, known as condottieri, had simply done just enough fighting\nto fulfill their contracts. And for Italy’s condottieri,\nwar wasn’t about glory or conquest: it was purely about getting paid. For much of the 14th and 15th centuries,\nthe condottieri dominated Italian warfare, profiting from— and encouraging—\nthe region’s intense political rivalries. The most powerful of these regions were\nruled either by wealthy representatives of the Catholic Church or merchants who’d grown rich\nfrom international trade. These rulers competed\nfor power and prestige by working to attract the most talented\nartists and thinkers to their courts, leading to a cultural explosion\nnow known as the Italian Renaissance. But local rivalries also played \nout in military conflicts, fought almost entirely by the condottieri. Many of these elite mercenaries were\nveterans of the Hundred Years’ War, hailing from France and England. When that war reached\na temporary truce in 1360, some soldiers began pillaging\nFrance in search of fortune. And the riches they found \nin Catholic churches drew their raiding parties to the center\nof the Church’s operations: Italy. But here, savvy ruling merchants\nsaw these bandits’ arrival as a golden opportunity. By hiring the soldiers as mercenaries, they could control the violence\nand gain an experienced army without the cost of outfitting\nand training locals. The mercenaries liked this deal as well,\nas it offered regular income and the ability to play these rulers\noff each other for their own benefit. Of course, these soldiers had\nto be kept on a tight leash. Rulers forced them to sign\nelaborate contracts, or condotta, a word that became synonymous\nwith the mercenaries themselves. Divisions of payment, distribution\nof plunder, non-compete agreements— it was all spelled out clearly, making war merely another\ndimension of business. Contracts specified the number of men\na commander would provide, and the resulting armies ranged\nfrom a few hundred to several thousand. Individual soldiers regularly moved\nbetween armies in search of higher payments. And when their contracts expired, condottieri commanders became free agents\nwith no expectation of ongoing loyalty. When John Hawkwood launched his\nsurprise attack against the Florentine condottieri, he was working for Pisa. Later, he would fight for Florence\nand many of Pisa’s other enemies. But regardless of who was\ncontracting them, the condottieri fought primarily\nfor themselves. Their extensive military experience\nallowed them to avoid taking unnecessary risks\nin the heat of battle. And— while still deadly— their clashes\nrarely led to crushing victories or defeats. Condottieri commanders wanted battles\nto be inconclusive— after all, if they established peace,\nthey’d put themselves out of business. So even when one side did win, enemy combatants were typically held\nhostage and released to fight another day. But there was nothing merciful\nabout these decisions. Contracts could just as easily turn them\ninto ruthless killers, as in 1377, when Hawkwood led the massacre\nof a famine-stricken town who’d tried to revolt\nagainst the local government. Over time, foreign condottieri were\nincreasingly replaced by native Italians. For young men from humble origins, war-for-profit offered an attractive\nalternative to farming or the church. And this new generation of condottieri\nleveraged their military power into political influence, in some cases even founding\nruling dynasties.

{"page": 103, "lesson": 5, "title": "One of history's most dangerous myths - Anneliese Mehnert", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/history-s-most-dangerous-myth-anneliese-mehnert", "transcript": {"en": "From the 1650s through the late 1800s, European colonists descended\non South Africa. First, Dutch and later British forces\nsought to claim the region for themselves, with their struggle becoming\neven more aggressive after discovering the area’s\nabundant natural resources. In their ruthless scramble, both colonial powers violently removed\nnumerous Indigenous communities from their ancestral lands. Yet despite these conflicts, the colonizers often claimed\nthey were settling in empty land devoid of local people. These reports were corroborated\nin letters and travelogues by various administrators,\nsoldiers, and missionaries. Maps were drawn reflecting these claims, and prominent British historians\nsupported this narrative. Publications codifying the so-called\nEmpty Land Theory had three central arguments. First, most of the land\nbeing settled by Europeans had no established communities\nor agricultural infrastructure. Second, any African communities\nthat were in those regions had actually entered the area\nat the same time as Europeans, so they didn’t have an ancestral claim\nto the land. And third, since these African communities\nhad probably stolen the land from earlier, \nno-longer-present Indigenous people, the Europeans were within their rights\nto displace these African settlers. The problem is that all three of these\narguments were completely false. Almost none of this land was empty\nand Africans had lived here for millennia. Indigenous South Africans\nsimply had a different practice of land ownership \nfrom the Dutch and British. Land belonged to families or groups,\nnot individuals. And even that ownership\nwas more focused on the land’s agricultural products\nthan the land itself. Community leaders would distribute\nseasonal land rights, allowing various nomadic groups\nto graze cattle or forage for vegetation. Even the groups that did live\nin large agricultural settlements didn’t believe they owned the land\nas private property. But the colonizing Europeans had\nno respect for this system of ownership. They concluded the land\nbelonged to no one and could therefore be divided\namongst themselves. In this context, claims that\nthe land was “empty” were an ignorant oversimplification\nof a much more complex reality. But the Empty Land Theory allowed\nBritish academics to rewrite history and minimize native populations. In 1894, the European parliament\nin Cape Town took this exploitation even further\nby passing the Glen Grey Act. This decree made it\nfunctionally impossible for native Africans to own land, shattering the system of collective\ntribal ownership and creating a class of landless people. To justify the theft, Europeans painted\nthe locals as barbarians who lacked the capacity for reason and were better off being ruled\nby the colonizers. This strategy of stripping locals\nof their right to ancestral lands and casting native people as savages has\nbeen employed by many colonizers. Now known as the Empty Land Myth, this is a well-established technique\nin the colonial playbook, and its impact can be found \nin the history of many countries, including Australia, Canada,\nand the United States. And in South Africa, the influence \nof this narrative can be traced directly to a brutal campaign\nof institutionalized racism. Barred from their lands, the once self-sufficient population\nstruggled as migrant laborers and miners on European-owned property. The law forbade them from working\ncertain skilled jobs, and forced Africans to live\nin racially segregated areas. Over time,\nthese racist policies intensified, mandating separation in urban areas, restricting voting rights,\nand eventually building to apartheid. Under this system,\nAfrican people had no voting rights, and the education of native Africans \nwas overhauled to emphasize their legal and social\nsubservience to white settlers. This state of legally enforced racism\npersisted through the early 1990s, and throughout this period, colonists frequently invoked\nthe Empty Land Theory to justify the unequal distribution\nof land. South African resistance movements\nfought throughout the 20th century to gain political and economic freedom. And since the 1980s, South African\nscholars have been using archaeological evidence\nto correct the historical record. Today, South African schools are finally\nteaching the region's true history.

King", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-other-animals-understand-death-barbara-j-king", "transcript": {"en": "In 2018, an orca called\nTahlequah gave birth. But her daughter died within an hour. Tahlequah, however, didn’t leave her body. And over the next 17 days \nand 1,600 kilometers, she kept it afloat atop her own, diving to retrieve the body \nwhenever it slipped away, even after it began deteriorating. By altering her feeding \nand travel patterns, Tahlequah’s behavior\nwas certainly unusual. But was she mourning— or just confused? Do non-human animals grieve? This question is tricky. In 1871, Charles Darwin argued\nthat other animals experience a wide range of emotions,\nincluding grief. But, especially in the absence \nof a dependable bridge between our minds and theirs, many scientists have long been wary of projecting human emotions\nonto other animals. It’s also been thought that they might\ndisplay irregular behaviors after a death for other adaptive reasons. And, for a while, the paradigm was\nthat humans were exceptional: other animals were reacting and surviving, while we alone were thinking and feeling. This conception was increasingly\nchallenged during the 20th century. In 1985, for example, \na gorilla called Koko, who'd been trained to use some signs\nfrom American Sign Language, was told that her kitten\ncompanion had died. She made distress calls,\nand several weeks later, looking at a photo of another kitten\nsigned “cry,” “sad,” and “frown.” Now there’s a growing pool\nof data and observations suggesting that some animals,\nincluding mammals and birds, might experience what we call grief. In 2003, Eleanor, \nan elephant matriarch, collapsed. Within minutes, another matriarch called\nGrace neared and helped Eleanor stand, only for her to fall again. Grace vocalized, stayed by Eleanor’s side,\nand tried pushing her back up. When Eleanor died,\na female named Maui approached, positioned herself over Eleanor’s body,\nand rocked back and forth. Over the course of one week, elephants from five different families\nvisited Eleanor’s body. On separate occasions, elephants have been observed carrying\nthe remains of family members, including jawbones and tusks. In 2010, a giraffe was born with a\ndeformed foot and had trouble walking. The calf lived just four weeks. On the day the calf died,\n22 other females and four juveniles closely attended and occasionally\nnuzzled the body. On the third morning, the mother\nwas alone and still not eating, which giraffes usually do constantly. Instead, she stayed by her dead calf,\neven after hyenas ate away at the body. Scientists have also begun quantitatively\nassessing other animals’ responses to death. In 2006, researchers analyzed\nbaboon fecal samples for glucocorticoids, stress hormones that spike\nwhen humans are bereaved. They compared the samples from females\nwho had lost a close relative in a predator attack \nwith those who hadn’t. And they found that the glucocorticoid\nlevels of baboons who had were significantly higher the month\nfollowing the death. Those baboons then increased\ntheir grooming behavior and the number of their grooming partners, broadening and strengthening\ntheir social networks. Within two months, their glucocorticoid\nlevels returned to the baseline. Researchers have also observed primate\nmothers engaging in apparently contradictory behaviors while carrying\ntheir dead children. Like switching between cannibalizing\nor dragging their child’s corpse and carefully carrying or grooming it, suggesting that the mothers were\nexperiencing conflicting impulses towards the bodies. Our current understanding \nof the emotional landscapes of other animals is severely limited. To get a better grasp on mourning\nin the animal kingdom, we need a lot more research. But where does this leave us for now? Conversations around whether non-human\nanimals experience emotions, like grief, can be emotional, in part because their outcomes\nhave very real implications— like determining if orcas should be\nisolated and kept in captivity, or whether dairy cows should be separated\nfrom their newborn calves. Until we do have more data on the subject, should we treat non-human animals like\nthey may have the capacity to grieve? Or assume they don’t?

You and the professor have driven\nyour hovering DeLorean back to the past to undo your own meddling. But shortly after you fix your mistakes, another DeLorean appears\nand crashes into yours. Out step older versions\nof you and the professor, who apparently had the same idea\nfrom somewhere else in the timeline. The professors panic and explain\nthat the universe could collapse now that you’re both \nin the same time and place. The only hope is to merge the time streams\nby having each version of you simultaneously time travel home. You both have plenty of fuel, but the crash broke your\nchrono-stabilizing gyroscopes and your cars can only time travel\nunder very specific circumstances. Each of you will need to drive\na mile south, then a mile east, and then a mile north to get\nthe gyroscopes into temporal alignment. That would be easy, except each calibration requires placing\na portable time gate at your starting point, then driving into it at the precise end of\nyour three mile drive without it moving. Not only that, but your two time gates\nmust be placed at least 100 miles apart so their signals don’t interfere. In other words, you need to find two\ndifferent locations where you can drive a mile south, a mile east,\nand then a mile north and end up exactly where you started. The professors are about to show you where\nyou can do this when they vanish, becoming victims \nof the collapsing timeline. It’s up to you now: where can you place the time gates? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If the earth were flat, there would\nbe no way to solve this riddle. What you need is some way to use the\nsphericalness of the planet, some of its notable features, and the fact that lines of latitude aren’t\nreally lines— they’re circles. The equator is the biggest of these\ncircles, but it doesn’t do much for you, and you can’t even go south\nfrom the South Pole. But let's try the North Pole. When you go a mile south, you'll be\non a circle that runs east west. After a mile east, you’re still\non that same circle, so the final mile north brings you \nback to your starting point. Perfect. That’s one gate down, but where\nshould you place the second? Well, the nice thing about circles is\nthat if you travel on them far enough, you come back to where you started. If there were a circle that had\na circumference of one mile, that would work marvelously. You could drive south a mile to reach it,\nmake the one mile rotation east, then go north a mile to return\nto where you started. Such a circle does exist just\nnorth of the South Pole. To find your starting point, you can use the standard formula\nfor the circumference of a circle. If you wanted to be absolutely precise, you could use an equation\nthat takes into account the roughly spherical shape of the Earth. But an area this small is\nso close to being flat that the standard formula gives a solution\nwithin a fraction of an inch of the actual distance. A circle with a one mile circumference has\na radius of just under 0.16 miles, so any point on the circle \none mile north of that will be suitable for your time gate. In fact, there are other answers too: start a little further south, and you could travel east around the\nEarth twice, three times, or more! In theory, there are infinite\npossible starting points, but the circles get so tight that they\naren't actually practical to drive. Everything’s getting a little weird by the time you reach \nyour starting points. You drop the time gates,\nsync up with your doppelgänger, and slam down the pedal. You both reach 88mph just as you complete\nyour three mile circuits, merge the timelines,\nand save the universe."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do you need to do to get your car’s chrono-stabilizing gyroscopes into temporal alignment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Take care of your childhood bully, Riff."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Drive a mile south, a mile east, and a mile north."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fix your car’s microverse battery."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Get your car to the time car mechanic."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Where does the time gate need to be placed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "At the start of your 3-mile drive"}, {"label": "B", "text": "At the end of your 3-mile drive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "At a single point that’s both the start and end of your 3-mile drive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "At the equator"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why can’t you send both cars to the same place to time travel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "You might run into each other."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The time gates must be placed at least 100 miles apart."}, {"label": "C", "text": "You need to search for new discoveries."}, {"label": "D", "text": "You can!

It’s time to grab your seat\nfor the biggest battle in the soon-to-be-formed universe. That’s right— \nthe Big Bang is about to go down! In one corner is the force that brings\nall matter together. It acts on any particle with mass,\nand its range is infinite— give it up for gravity! In the other corner, our contender can\npush matter away with spectacular strength. When the going gets tough,\nthis fighter just gets tougher. That’s right, it’s pressure! Over the next several\nhundred thousand years, these two contenders will be wrestling\nfor the fate of the universe. That’s right folks, the ripple effects\nof this historic match will shape the structure of the universe\nas we know it today. But what are these powers fighting over? We’ll find out when the Big Bang\nhits right... now! Let’s zoom in for the play-by-play. This epic event has brought three\ncomponents into our infant universe. Dark matter, which only interacts\nwith gravity. Baryonic matter, which makes\nup all matter you’ve ever seen, is affected by both gravity and pressure. And radiation composed \nof innumerable particles of light, also known as photons. In the moments just after the Big Bang, all three components are in equilibrium, meaning no one location\nis denser than another. But as the universe starts expanding,\ndifferences in density start to emerge. Gravity immediately gets to work\npulling matter together. Dark matter begins to collect\nat the center of these increasingly\ndense regions, forming the foundations\nof future galaxies. Meanwhile, pressure begins gathering\nits strength. In this hot, high-energy environment, protons and electrons can’t come\ntogether to form atoms, so these loose particles zip around,\nfreely interacting with ambient photons. The result is almost a fluid\nof baryonic matter and radiation. But the closer these baryonic particles\nget, the hotter the fluid becomes, pushing photons to ping\naround with incredible force. This is the power of pressure,\nspecifically radiation pressure, battling to push things apart. With each of gravity’s vicious tugs\nsqueezing photons and matter together, pressure exerts a forceful shove back. And as the two giants struggle,\nthey heave this fluid back and forth— creating massive waves called\nbaryonic acoustic oscillations. Moving at almost two thirds\nthe speed of light these BAOs ripple across space, impacting the universe\non the biggest scale imaginable. These rolling waves determine the\ndistribution of matter throughout space, meaning that today— almost 14 billion\nyears after this fight began— we're more likely to find\ngalaxies at their peaks and empty space in their troughs. And that’s not all. We can still see these ripples in the\nbackground radiation of the universe, a permanent reminder of this epic brawl. But after being locked in a stalemate\nfor roughly 370,000 years, the tide of our battle finally\nbegins to turn. After all this time, the heat from the\nBig Bang has dissipated significantly, cooling the universe down to a temperature at which loose electrons\nstart to pair up with protons. Known as the “era of recombination,” this stops electrons\nfrom recklessly pinging around. This allows light to stream freely\nfor the first time, illuminating the universe. These photons now only exert a tiny force\non the neutral atoms they interact with, gradually reducing the power of pressure. And with that, it’s time to crown\nour champion! The undefeated force,\nthe most pervasive power in the universe: it’s gravity! And yet, this rivalry isn’t over. A similar battle continues between these\ntwo sworn enemies today, within every single star. As gravity pulls a star’s gas inward, pressure increases and pushes\nthe matter back outward. This push and pull keeps the Sun,\nand all other stars, stable for billions of years. In fact, this clash of the titans\nis the same reason Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t collapse\nto the ground.

Neighbor turned against neighbor\nas violence engulfed the region, resulting in the deaths of over one-tenth\nof the country’s population. The seeds of this conflict were\nplanted a century earlier, first when German, and later Belgian,\ncolonizers arrived in the country. At the time, Rwanda was ruled\nby a monarchy of Tutsi, one of the three ethnic groups\ncomprising the population. Tutsi and the even smaller Twa communities\nwere minority groups, while Hutu composed the majority. Many Hutus and Tutsi civilians\nwere on good terms, but colonial powers encouraged\npolitical division. Belgians enforced record keeping\naround ethnic identity, and created a public narrative that cast\nTutsi as elite rulers and Hutu as ordinary farmers. Over time, this propaganda led \nto intense political hostility. And while colonial powers had\nlargely withdrawn by 1959, lingering anger motivated a Hutu revolt, forcing many Tutsi leaders\nto flee the country. Over the following decade, Rwanda transitioned to an independent\nrepublic with a Hutu government. This new administration argued\nthat as the majority group, Hutu deserved exclusive access\nto political power. They excluded the Tutsi minority \nby appointing offices based on population and prohibited the return of Tutsi\nfamilies that had fled years earlier. Hutu extremists also circulated propaganda blaming Tutsi for the country’s economic,\nsocial, and political problems. Discontent with their life in exile, a small group of Tutsi insurgents\ninvaded Rwanda in 1990, beginning a violent civil war. The conflict lasted three years before it\nwas resolved with a formal peace accord. But the war’s aftermath was\nrife with insecurity. While some civilians in both groups\nremained amicable, the treaty intensified\npolitical polarization. And in 1994, when a plane carrying\nthe Hutu Rwandan president was shot down, the conflict broke out anew. This time, Hutu officials had prepared\na deadly response to ensure they stayed in power. Working off a list of targets, government-funded Hutu militias\nflooded the streets, perpetrating acts of physical\nand sexual violence against Tutsi political enemies\nand civilians. Over the chaotic following months, over 1 million Hutu civilians joined\ntheir ranks due to coercion, self-preservation, or the pursuit\nof personal agendas. Tutsi victims sought refuge\nat churches and schools where they hoped international\norganizations would protect them, but no outside party came to their aid. UN soldiers who’d overseen\nthe Peace Accord were instructed to abandon\nTutsi civilians, and UN leadership refused to acknowledge\nthe genocide taking place. The violence didn’t end until mid-July, when the Tutsi army—\nwho instigated the previous civil war— seized control of the country. By the time the fighting was over, roughly 800,000 Rwandans had been killed, and only a small fraction of the\nTutsi population was left alive. In the months that followed, there was no easy strategy for bringing\nthe killers to justice. The UN established a special tribunal\nin Tanzania to try the key perpetrators. But Hutu civilians from every level\nof society had committed atrocities against their neighbors, friends,\nand even family members. There were roughly 120,000 Rwandans\nawaiting trial, and inmates were dying from overcrowding\nand poor hygiene. The new Rwandan government estimated \nit would take 100 years to prosecute every accused civilian in national court. So officials determined \nthe best path forward involved looking to the country’s past. Rwanda has a traditional process for resolving interpersonal conflicts\ncalled gacaca. Roughly translating\nto “justice on the grass,” gacaca had long been used to address\noffenses within villages. Local witnesses would offer testimony and could then speak for\nor against the accused. Then, appointed lay judges would determine\nan appropriate penalty within the community’s means. In the hope of trying perpetrators\nmore quickly, the government adapted gacaca\nfor their formal courts. These hybrid trials had \nno professional attorneys or judges, and no evidence outside the spoken word and a case file detailing the crimes\nof the accused. All charges were then divided\ninto four categories: masterminding the genocide\nand committing acts of sexual violence, participating in the killings,\nphysical assault, or destroying Tutsi property. Those found guilty\nof the first two categories were entered into the\ntraditional court system, but the other crimes were\nassigned set penalties which could be reduced\nif the accused pled guilty. Beginning in 2002, thousands of gacaca\ncourts convened every week. The process proved faster \nthan conventional courts, but Rwandan opinion on the trials\nwas mixed. Some didn’t want to accuse\ntheir neighbors in a community setting, and many potential witnesses were\nintimidated to prevent their testimony. Additionally, while the trial showed that\nnot all Hutu participated in the killings, the courts only reviewed cases\nwith Tutsi victims, ignoring the Hutu casualties incurred\nduring the genocide and the preceding civil war. When the trials concluded in 2012, the courts had convicted\n1.7 million individuals. For some families, these verdicts \nhelped restore the dignity of those lost in the violence. For others, the trials\nwere a decade-long reminder of a past they were desperate\nto leave behind."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Rwanda was colonized by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Belgium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germany"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Germany and Belgium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Great Britain"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What ethnic groups is the Rwandan society is composed of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hutu and Tutsi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hutu, Tutsi and Twa"}, {"label": "C", "text": " Hutu and Twa"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "At the time of the genocide in 1994, Rwanda’s government was _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hutu"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tutsi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Twa"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In order to come to terms with the past, village tribunal called gacaca, which translates ___________, were set up .", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Justice in the grass"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fair trials for all"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The truth shall heal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "End to Impunity"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Over the course of 10 years, how many individuals were convicted?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100.000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "800.000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1.7 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3 million"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 103, "lesson": 11, "title": "Should you switch to solar? - Shannon Odell", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/are-solar-panels-worth-it-shannon-odell", "transcript": {"en": "In the spring of 1954, the press excitedly gathered around\nBell Laboratories’ latest invention— a silicon-based solar cell\nthat could efficiently convert the sun's energy into electrical current. The creation was celebrated\nas the dawn of a new era, as reporters touted that civilization\nwould soon run on the sun’s limitless energy. But the dream had a catch,\nas this first commercially sold solar cell cost around $300 per watt, meaning at its current rate, it would cost well over a million\nto buy a unit large enough to power a single home. But today in many countries solar is the cheapest form\nof energy to produce, surpassing fossil fuel alternatives\nlike coal and natural gas. Millions of homes are equipped\nwith rooftop solar, with most units paying for themselves\nin their first 7 to 12 years and then generating further savings. So how did solar become so affordable? A turning point in solar’s\nprice history occurred on the floor of Germany’s parliament,\nwhere in 2000, Herman Scheer introduced \nthe Renewable Energy Sources Act. This legislation laid out a vision\nfor the country’s energy future in solar and wind. It incentivized citizens to personally\ninvest in rooftop solar panels by guaranteeing payment to homeowners\nfor the renewable energy they generated and sold to the grid. The pay rate for this electricity was\nhighly subsidized, at times reaching four times\nthe market price. Several other countries soon\nfollowed Germany’s example, implementing similar\npolicies and incentives to drive their country’s solar use. This created unprecedented demand\nfor solar panels worldwide. Manufacturers were\nable to scale up production and innovate in ways that cut costs. As a result, solar panel prices dropped,\nwhile efficiency grew. Today, a 46-square-meter rooftop\nsolar unit is often efficient enough to fully power a home, and this residential unit\nno longer costs millions— in the US in 2022,  the average\nconsumer cost of a rooftop solar unit ranged from around $17,000 to $23,000. These prices dropped by over 60%\nbetween 2010 and 2020 alone. So how much money can you save\nby switching to solar? US solar equipped homeowners\ncan save around $1,500 per year on their energy bills, equating to a net savings of $10,000\nto $30,000 during the unit’s lifetime. Month-to-month savings\ntend to vary, based on the amount of direct sunlight \nyour panel receives, weather conditions, and the price\nof electricity where you live. But not everyone can get solar. Adopting solar can be difficult\nfor renters, and in many countries, more than 25% of adults don’t own\ntheir own homes. Even if you do, your roof must meet\ncertain orientation and tilt requirements to make solar a worthwhile investment. And while units often pay for themselves\nthrough offset energy costs, the initial purchase and installation\nprice for solar can be expensive. But several companies have adopted\nsolar leasing models, where they finance the material costs, installation, and upkeep\nof the rooftop systems. Homeowners can then buy the panel’s\ngenerated electricity at a fixed rate that’s generally lower\nthan the local utility’s price. Still, many are working\ntowards community-based solutions, which would enable entire neighborhoods\nto profit from solar use. Europe is home to more than 7,000\ncommunity energy associations, where local members collectively\ninvest in wind turbines and solar panels to power their local grid. In 2005, the German town of Wolfhagen\ncreated an 800 member citizens co-op, which communally invested $2.84 million to buy up 25% of the local energy company and expand its renewables program. Today, its turbines and panels\ngenerate enough energy to meet the town’s needs and then some. Surplus energy is sold\nto neighboring towns, and profits are reinvested\nback into the community. For many, the appeal of solar\ngoes beyond just savings. Homes equipped with it are\nmore climate resilient, because they can be protected\nfrom utility grid outages and brownouts. Not to mention solar’s key role\nin decarbonizing the energy grid. By working together with larger-scale\nwind and solar farms, rooftop solar units help reduce\nour reliance on fossil fuels, paving the way for a cleaner\nand more reliable energy future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When solar cells were first invented in the 1950s, what was the cost the electricity they produced?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "$100/Watt"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$200/Watt"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$300/Watt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$400/Watt"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In many countries, solar energy is the cheapest form of electricity.

I’m Shamash, the Mesopotamian\ngod of judgment, and today we’re gathered to witness \nthis year’s clash of stunning speed. Keeping track of our racers with me\nis last year’s champion, Hermes— the swift-footed messenger\nof the Greek gods. Oh, I'm delighted to hang up my\nwinged sandals today, Shamash. But I am keeping my helmet on because\nwe are in for a wild ride! It’s true! Almost every mythical tradition\nclaims one creature as the fastest of them all. From goddesses who run like the wind\nto creatures who outstrip every captor, mortals of all cultures are fascinated\nby superhuman swiftness. So, Hermes, who are \nthis year’s contestants? Well, the Norse gods have sent Sleipnir— son of Loki and the greatest\nof Asgard’s steeds. He’s usually spotted gallivanting\nbetween the realms with Odin. But today, Sleipnir is riding solo. Also competing is Raiju, the Japanese\nbeast of thunder and lightning. When the weather’s nice, they like\nto nap in mortals’ belly buttons. But when clouds darken, Raiju leaps\ninto action alongside Raijin, the Shinto god of storms. With this fearsome competitor,\nlightning can strike at any time. But storms don’t scare Idaten. This Buddhist deity has a record\nof outrunning the weather— his name is even part of the Japanese\nexpression for “run like the wind.” Idaten’s definitely got some tricks\nup those steel sleeves. Perhaps, but our last competitor\nhas tricks of his own. Savitar is the Hindu deity\nthat sets everything in motion, from moving the Sun\nto chasing away sorrow and sickness. Yes, today’s roster contains many\nmythic interpretations of speed. From personifications \nof the unpredictable elements to creatures capable of outrunning\nreality itself. But perhaps the myth of speed\nis really about the elusive nature of all supernatural beings. Those are some, uh, neat ideas, Shamash—\nbut this race is the real deal! Our noble competitors will run\nthe equivalent of 100 marathons through a hazardous\nnatural obstacle course. And our racers are taking \ntheir first steps right now! Idaten takes the lead, but don’t let\nthat calm exterior fool you— his determination is legendary. When a literal speed demon stole\none of Buddha's teeth, he raced over mountains and rivers\nto capture the culprit. Don’t forget Sleipnir— \nhe’s cleared hurdles in his time, too. I’ll say! On his mission to retrieve\nBaldur the Bright from the fortress of Hel,\nhe rode for nine days straight— clearing the gates of the underworld\nwithout breaking a sweat. They don’t call him\nthe sliding one for nothing— he appears to slide on the wind itself! Of course, wind is often personified\nas a sacred being that— No time for a history lesson!\nThat wind is picking up! Like the force of nature they are, Raiju\nbrews a storm to scorch the competition. It’s certainly possible. Raiju is known\nfor their destructive storms. But they’re also our most chaotic racer, frequently crashing to earth and \ngetting tangled in flimsy mortal nets. They’re unpredictable! Chaos is often associated\nwith mythology’s fastest creatures, from the shapeshifting Flemish Kludde\nwho preys on travelers to the smelly Japanese spirit Nuppeppō\nwho moves too fast to be caught. True, but there are also steady agents\nof speed. Here comes one now! Lending his boundless energy to the Sun,\nSavitar breaks through Raiju’s storm! This golden-handed protector of the\nuniverse can manipulate the elements— and all moving things for that matter! A valiant effort to redirect the wind\nby Idaten... but not valiant enough. The path seems clear for Savitar. But is that the gallop of hooves I hear? What beautiful blindside! It’s Sleipnir hurtling \nout of another dimension! it seems the shamanic steed shares Odin’s\nability to travel between the realms. This racer might not have to play\nby Savitar’s rules. But... wait a second,\nam I watching this in slow motion? No! It appears the god of motion is\nslowing the speed of his opponent, suspending him centimeters\nfrom the course’s conclusion. Sleipnir’s stampede slows\nto a snail’s pace as Savitar leisurely glides\nover the finish line! What a finale! Savitar’s mastery of motion\nimmobilized his fastest foe! It seems Sleipnir’s not too happy\nwith this controversial result, but hey, there’s always next year.

{"page": 103, "lesson": 13, "title": "Do you see a face? You're actually hallucinating - Susan G. Wardle", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-our-brains-see-faces-everywhere-susan-g-wardle", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine opening a bag of chips only\nto find Santa Claus looking back at you. Or turning the corner to see\na smile as wide as a building. Humans see faces in all kinds\nof mundane objects, but these faces aren’t real— they’re illusions due to a phenomenon\nknown as face pareidolia. So why exactly does this happen, and how\nfar can this distortion of reality go? Humans are social animals, and reading faces is an important part\nof our ability to understand each other. Even a glimpse of someone's face can help\nyou determine if you've met them before, what mood they’re in,\nand if they’re paying attention to you. We even use facial features\nto make snap-judgments about a person’s potential trustworthiness\nor aggression. To capture all this vital information, humans have evolved to be very sensitive\nto face-like structures. Whenever we see something, our brain immediately starts working\nto identify the new visual stimuli based on our expectations\nand prior knowledge. And since faces are so important, humans have evolved several regions\nof the brain that enable us to identify them\nfaster than other visual stimuli. Whereas recognizing most objects takes\nour brain around a quarter of a second, we can detect a face\nin just a tenth of a second. It makes sense that we'd prioritize\nidentifying faces over everything else. But brain imaging studies \nhave revealed that regions may actually be too sensitive, leading them to find faces\nwhere they don’t exist. In one study, participants reported\nseeing illusory faces in over 35% of pure-noise images\nshown to them, despite the fact that nothing was there. It might seem concerning that our brains\ncan be so wrong so often, but these illusory faces\nmight actually be a byproduct of something evolutionarily advantageous. Since processing all the visual input\nwe encounter quickly and correctly is an enormous computational\neffort for the brain, this kind of hypersensitivity might\nact as a useful shortcut. After all, seeing illusory faces\nis usually harmless, while missing a real face can\nlead to serious issues. But for hypersensitivity to be\nmore helpful than harmful, our brains also need to be quick \nat determining when a face is real and when it isn’t. So how fast can our brains tell\nwhen they’ve been duped? To answer this question,\nresearchers used a form of brain imaging known as magnetoencephalography. By measuring the magnetic fields caused\nby electric currents in the brain, this technique allows us to track\nchanges in brain activity at the scale of milliseconds. With this tool, researchers revealed\nthat the brain generally recognizes a face as illusory\nwithin a quarter of a second— around the same time that we can identify\nmost non-face visual stimuli. However, even after our brain\nknows the face is fake, we can still see it in the object. And by messing with these brain areas, we can further impact our ability to\ndifferentiate between fact from fiction. In one study, researchers stimulated\na participant’s fusiform face area while they were looking \nat a non-face object. As a result, the participant reported\nmomentarily seeing facial features despite the object remaining unchanged. And while looking at a real face,\nstimulation of this same area created perceived distortions\nof the eyes and nose. These studies suggest that certain\nfeatures are crucial to face detection. Just three dots can be enough\nto represent eyes and a mouth. People will even assign gender, age,\nand emotion to illusory faces. It’s unclear whether a person’s culture\nor individual history impacts these perceptions, but we do know that pareidolia isn’t\nunique to the human experience. Rhesus macaque monkeys show eye movements\nsimilar to our own when observing pareidolia-inducing objects\nand real faces, suggesting that this phenomenon is baked\ndeep into our social primate brains. So, next time you see an unexpected\nface in a coffee, car, or cabinet, remember that it’s just your brain\nworking overtime not to miss the faces that really matter."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is face pareidolia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The ability to recognize faces faster than other objects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The perception of faces in inanimate objects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A condition where people have difficulty recognizing faces"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A part of the brain that responds to faces"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Approximately how long does the brain take to recognize that a face in an object is illusory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ten seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "One second"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Half a second"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Quarter of a second"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which species of animal has been shown to see illusory faces in objects like we do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Apes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rats"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Monkeys"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dogs"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In one study mentioned in the video, what did the person see when researchers stimulated the fusiform face area in their brain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Illusory facial features on an ordinary object"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Distorted eyes and nose of a human face"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Flashes of light everywhere they looked"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both a and b"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the reason why we see illusory faces in objects?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Our brains are hypersensitive to faces"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are funny to look at"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Our vision is better than most other animals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 103, "lesson": 14, "title": "What did people do before anesthesia? - Sally Frampton", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-did-people-do-before-anesthesia-sally-frampton", "transcript": {"en": "With medical students restraining the\npatient and onlookers eagerly awaiting, Scottish surgeon Robert Liston \npoised himself to begin. In quick succession, \nhe cut his patient’s flesh, sawed through their tibia and fibula\nand, within just a few minutes, the amputation was complete. It was the 1830s and Liston was renowned\nfor his surgical speed. This was important because, \nbefore anesthesia was widely used, patients had to consciously endure\nevery moment of surgery. The quest for anesthetics\nthat could induce unconsciousness and enable more meticulous surgeries\nlaunched long before Liston. Around 200 CE, Chinese physician Hua Tuo\ndescribed mixing alcohol with a powder of various ingredients\nto anesthetize patients. And 13th century Arab surgeon Ibn al-Quff\ndescribed patients taking anesthetics, likely inhaling drugs like cannabis, \nopium, and mandrake, from saturated sponges. By the end of the 1700s, \nmany scientists were pondering chemistry’s medical applications. This led to a profusion of anesthetic\nadvancements involving three main players: nitrous oxide, ether, and chloroform. In 1799, English chemist Humphry Davy\nbegan experimenting with nitrous oxide, or laughing gas— inhaling it himself\nand observing its effects on friends. Davy noted that its pain-relieving\nabilities might make it useful for surgical operations— but it would be decades \nbefore that happened. This was, at least in part,\nbecause some surgeons and patients were skeptical of the effectiveness \nand safety of anesthetic drugs. In 1804, Japanese surgeon Seishū Hanaoka\nsuccessfully removed a breast tumor from a patient anesthetized\nwith a mix of medicinal herbs. But the news stayed in Japan indefinitely. Eventually, ether started garnering\nmedical attention. It was first formulated centuries before\nthen came to be used recreationally. During the so-called “ether frolics”\nof the early 1800s, an American physician noted \nthat the fall he suffered while using ether was painless. In 1842, he etherized a patient \nand successfully removed a tumor from his neck. In the meantime, dentists finally began\nrecognizing nitrous oxide’s promise. But, in 1845, when an American dentist\nattempted a public tooth extraction on someone anesthetized\nwith nitrous oxide, he apparently encountered a setback\nwhen his patient screamed. It was probably just an insufficient dose— but it was a bad publicity\nmoment for the drug. Meanwhile, dentists refined ether\nfor tooth extractions. And, in October 1846, an American dentist\nadministered ether to a patient, and a surgeon removed\nthe man’s neck tumor. Two months later, Liston himself performed\nan upper leg amputation on an etherized patient, who reportedly regained consciousness\nminutes after and asked when the procedure would begin. Further ether-enabled successes followed\nfrom India, Russia, and beyond. But ether had issues, \nincluding unpleasant side effects. Scottish obstetrician James Simpson\nheard about an alternative anesthetic called chloroform. And, in 1847, he and two colleagues\ndecided to try some themselves and promptly passed out. Soon after, Simpson\nadministered chloroform to one of his patients during childbirth. It quickly gained popularity\nbecause it was fast-acting and thought to be side-effect-free— though we now know it’s harmful\nand probably carcinogenic. Because anesthetics weren’t\nyet fully understood, they sometimes had lethal consequences. And some doctors held sexist\nand racist beliefs that dictated the amount of anesthesia they’d provide,\nif any at all. American obstetrician Charles Meigs argued\nthat the pain of childbirth was a form of divine suffering and was skeptical that doctors \nshould interfere with it. Throughout the 1840s,\nAmerican physician James Marion Sims conducted experimental gynecological\nsurgeries without pain relief, primarily upon enslaved Black women. By the late 19th century, \nthose who could access anesthetics were undergoing increasingly\ncomplex operations, including some that were\npreviously impossible. Chloroform came to be understood\nas a riskier, more toxic option, and fell out of favor by the early 1900s. Alongside newer drugs, ether\nand nitrous oxide are still used today— but in modified formulations that are\nsafer and produce fewer side effects, while doctors closely monitor\nthe patient’s state. Thanks to these advances, speed is not always of the essence and,\ninstead of acute agony, surgery can feel like just a dream."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What substances did 13th-century surgeon Ibn al-Quff use to create his anesthetic mixture?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nightshade and cocoa leaf"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Alcohol "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cannabis, opium, and mandrake"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Willow bark"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How long might a leg amputation take in the 1830s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5 minutes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15 minutes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30 minutes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "60 minutes"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which group was chiefly responsible for the introduction of ether in surgery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chemists"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dentists"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Surgeons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Physicians"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the main reason chloroform started to become more popular than ether?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Easier to administer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Preferred by patients"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fast-acting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cheaper"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these anesthetics continue to be used in a modified form today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ether and nitrous oxide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nitrous oxide and chloroform"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chloroform and ether"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None "}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

And the reason for that is at least partially genetic, which is why this video is supported by 23andMe, a company that reads sections of your genetic code and then helps you understand, what's in there. Now, they've actually been involved in some research that has identified particular spots on your DNA that make you more or less likely to be attractive to mosquitoes, and in this video I want to put that to the test. So I flew to New Mexico State University to meet mosquito man Professor Immo Hansen. Everyone: Hello! Hansen: We have a collection of lab strains Derek: Here, he maintains colonies of many different species of mosquitoes, and one exotic strain he actually feeds with his own blood(!) Hansen: No, no, I'm serious. These ones are made from my blood. D: Really!?\nH: Yes! Absolutely, yeah. D: You feed these!?\nH: And I'm the only one feeding them - I can't ask my students, you know, that would be a nightmare H: getting permissions to this room here.\nD: How do you blood feed them?

The eggs hatch into these wriggly larvae, which develop into pupae before becoming flying, adult mosquitoes. Then they, once again, seek out vertebrate blood to make more eggs. The whole lifecycle takes just two weeks! But what I wanted to know is: am I a desirable target? D: How can we figure out if I'm attractive to mosquitoes? H: Okay, we have a Y-tube, basically, which has a holding chamber. We put the mosquitoes down here, H: there's a little fan inducing a draft, something like 4 m/s. We're gonna insert a bait into one of these chambers, in the green or the yellow one. D: So, by bait, you're saying me?\nH: Yes, you, exactly.\nD: [laughs] H: You put your hand in there. [It] would be good if you would rub your hand first, so H: If you're sweaty...\nD: Get some oils?\nH: Yes! D: This is the right spot...\nH: That's where the good stuff is, exactly. H: Almost feeds exclusively on humans. They are really specialized on biting humans. D: That's good to know...\nH: Yeah\n[both laugh] H: There's 20 mosquitoes in the holding chamber. D: And they're gonna decide whether to come and find me, or go down the other side and... they find nothing. H: Right.\nD: We're releasing the mosquitoes. I see them coming! D: Oh, he's chosen wrong! H: Do you see that? H: Man, you are attractive! D: Really?\nH: I mean, sorry I-\n[both laugh] H: You are a strong attractant to mosquitoes. They all went in your direction.\nD: None of them went the other way! D: (laughing) This is amazing! H: Well, there's one stranded in here\nD: I did not expect to have such a strong... response, like D: You see all those mosquitoes... D: This type of test was actually used to discover that the basis for our attractiveness to mosquitoes is at least partially genetic. Researchers recruited 18 pairs of identical female twins and 19 pairs of non identical, or fraternal female twins. Then they used the Y-tube Test to evaluate the mosquito attractiveness of each individual, measured by the fraction of mosquitoes who correctly flew to the arm of the tube where the twin was standing. What scientists found is that the mosquito attractiveness of twins is correlated, that is, the more attractive you are to mosquitoes, the more likely your twin is, too. But that's... not all that surprising, and could be caused by environmental factors, or a common diet. But, comparing identical twins to fraternal twins revealed the correlation was higher for identical twins. This strongly suggests genetics influence how attractive you are to mosquitoes. Since the identical twins share more of the same genes than fraternal twins, this explains why their mosquito attractiveness would be more closely correlated if it really is genetics that determines how much mosquitoes like you. D: With that last test, I was clearly attractive to these mosquitoes.\nH: Yes.\nD: Except we weren't comparing me to any other human, D: we were just comparing me to a control, no human.\nH: Exactly, yes. D: So, what if we compare myself with my wife Raquel? [laughs]\nH: Uh-huh? D: Normally, I get bitten and she doesn't.\nH: Okay.\nD: So this should be a good test... maybe? D: To see whether under lab conditions... H: We can we reproduce your...\nD: We'll reproduce our anecdotal finding. That I'm more attractive.\nH: Exactly, anecdotal evidence a little once again H: They are a little...\nD: Once again... D: ...preparing. H: Okay!\nD: Hands in position!\nRaquel: Yeah. H: Yeah, see, they actually start to wake up. They... smelled something. Something's going on here.\nR: Here we go. H: Okay. \nD: What are we seein'? D: Whoa! D: I'm getting a good amount over here, but so are you? D: Let's see. I think I'm getting more. It looks to me like you got three. H: Okay, I'm gonna stop the experiment right now.\nD: Alright. H: *chuck!* Okay, now let's count. I think it's seven on your side here? Lab assistant: Five in the holding.\nH: Five in the holding. H: And quite a few on your side!\n[Hansen and Derek laugh] H: So, who gets bitten?\nD: I get bitten.\nH: You get bitten! H: In reality, we would repeat this experiment, maybe eight times or so. D: Right.\nH: And switching you guys around, but I think this is a good way to show how this works. D: Okay, so that result was not particularly scientifically rigorous, but it did reproduce our experience in the wild, D: which is that I am much more attractive. ....Well at least when it comes to mosquitoes, than Raquel. D: But the question is, I guess, does this come down to our genetics? R: Yeah, so, we spat into some tubes and sent them off to be tested.\nD: Right, and we were interested in seven particular D: locations on our DNA, which were located in a 2017 study that involved 23andMe. D: So the way 23andMe works is, when you sign up, you can opt in to be part of research, D: and 16 000 people agreed to be part of this study and rate their perceived attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So then what the scientists did was a genome-wide association study, that is, they looked at all the DNA D: of all of those participants and tried to see if there were commonalities amongst the people who D: said they were attractive to mosquitoes and that were different to the people who said they weren't attractive to mosquitoes. D: And they identified seven particular locations on the DNA. Seven single letter changes which seemed D: to be associated with different levels of attractiveness to mosquitoes. D: So we have our results back, and do you wanna see them?\nR: I do. I do, I'm very curious. D: Alright, let's pull it up here. D: Okay, so of the seven locations that are related to mosquito attractiveness, it turns out we have the identical DNA at four of them. D: So you can rule those out.\nR: Okay.\nD: Which leaves only three areas where we actually have differing D: DNA. So, at the first location, you have one copy of a letter change which actually makes you significantly D: *protected* from mosquitoes.\nR: Oh, no way! D: Yeah, it's associated with decreased attractive to mosquitoes\nR: Oh, that's cool! D: I do not have any letter changes at that location. Now, at the second location where we differ, I have D: a letter change compared to you that makes *me* less attractive to mosquitoes, so more protected. R: Interesting.\nD: If you look at the significance of those two letter changes, D: yours is about twice as significant than mine.\nR: Okay. D: But still we both have a protective letter switch. So, in the last snip we actually differ significantly. D: And I have two copies of a variant that makes me more attractive to mosquitoes. D: This was the only snip which was associated with being more attractive to mosquitoes, D: and I have two copies of that change, and you have no copies of that change. R: So that makes sense.\nD: So overall, I would say our genetics really adds up here. D: And of course, we can't say that this proves that it is right, but it is definitely consistent D: with these snips actually being associated with your attractiveness to mosquitoes, and that's sort of... D: borne out by our experience.\nR: That's so cool! D: Now, it's unclear exactly how these genetic changes might make us more or less attractive to mosquitoes, but it's likely that it has something to do with the odor or the volatile chemicals that our bodies give off, and due to the microbiome, the bacteria on our skin. One of the main signals that mosquitoes like to follow is carbon dioxide. So that means if you have a higher metabolism, or if you've just been exercising, or if you're a bigger person, or even if you're pregnant, you are more likely to attract mosquitoes. But mosquitoes are also attracted to some other volatiles that we give off, things like lactic acid, acetone and ammonia. But scientists have also found some chemicals that repel, or appear to impair mosquitoes' ability to find us. Those chemicals we naturally give off are octanal, nonanal, decanal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one. So, why is this important? Well the researchers estimate that our attractiveness to mosquitoes is about as hereditary as height or IQ, that is to say genetics play a significant role here, so understanding that relationship is really important, especially when you consider that, of all the animals, mosquitoes have the greatest impact on human health. D: Are mosquitoes the worst animal of all time for humans?\nH: Absolutely. H: Absolutely, there's no question about that. Malaria has killed more people than people have killed people. They are the most dangerous animal in the world. D: By some estimates, mosquitoes have killed more than half of the humans who have ever lived. Now, that estimate has been debated and is likely too high, but even so, this year, over a million people will die of mosquito-borne illnesses. So if not half, certainly a significant number of humans have died due to mosquitoes, probably more than any other single cause, which led me to wonder: D: Do you think humans may have evolved this trait to smell worse to mosquitoes as an adaptation to avoid the diseases? Or... D: is it just by accident that some people are less attractive to mosquitoes than others? H: ....... H: ...That is a really good question!\n[both laugh] D: And while we're on the subject of evolution, consider this: if you ever contract malaria, it actually changes your body chemistry to make you produce an odor that makes you more attractive to mosquitoes. Think about that! The malaria parasite has evolved so that, when it's in its host, it makes the host more attractive to mosquitoes... mosquitoes are the thing that transmit malaria! It's phenomenal! I mean evolution is incredible!

Today, your family is known the world over\nas the world’s greatest fortune tellers. While the deck has increased \nyour fortunes many times over, it came with a terrible cost. Once every 23 years, \na door appears in your house. One member of your family must enter, and face Fate in a duel with arcane rules\nonly known to your opponent. And every time, \ngeneration after generation, the outcome is the same: Fate claims their soul. 23 years ago, your father accepted \nthe challenge and lost. Today, it’s your turn. You’re pacing the dueling room \nwhen you stumble across something that just might change everything: your father hid a camera in the room. The tape shows him lay\nout the 22 cards of the major Arcana. Fate then places an additional card,\nthe Soul, and speaks: “You may take any card that has \nat least one factor on the table. I’ll then receive every factor. Take the Tower, for example. It is 16, with factors 1, 2, 4, and 8. Those now belong to me,\nmaking our score 16 to 15. If your total at the end of the game\nis higher than mine, you’ll win. Play again and know that if you\nrun out of moves, I’ll take all the cards that remain.” As the game continues, Fate remarks that if your father \nwere to win and hold the 10, that would grant him great fortune. 6, true love. And the 2 would end \nthe family curse forever. But none of that matters because \nin the end his total comes up short. As the video turns to static,\nFate arrives. Feeling as if you’re in a dream, you hear her offer you the Tower \nto begin the game. How can you defeat Fate, and what other good fortune\ncan you win for yourself? Pause here to figure it out for yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 If you want to outplay Fate, \nyou’ll need to take the long view. Accepting the 16 gives Fate\nthe 1, 2, 4, and 8. She effectively has the 23, 19,\n17, and 13 too, since you can’t take prime numbers\nonce 1 is off the board. Smaller primes like 11, 7, 5, and 3\nwill also go to Fate, but you’ll be able to take \ntheir multiples, like 22 and 21. That means these are the remaining\ncards in play. You can eventually claim at most\nhalf of them, rounded down, since Fate gets at least one\nfor each card you take. So the best you can possibly do is\ntake the seven largest cards. Add those together with the 16 \nand your total would be 138. And Fate’s total? Also, 138. Ties go to Fate, so it’s clear that\nby offering your ancestors the 16 before explaining the full rules, Fate has been manipulating the game\nto guarantee her victory. But thanks to your father,\nyou now know better. Speaking of your family, if you want \nto take the 2 and break the curse, you’ll have to do it on your first turn,\nsince it’s prime. If you do, Fate will get 1, and once again, \nFate is guaranteed the high primes. In theory, you can get at most \n8 of the remaining 17 cards. Taking the eight largest would give \nyou a nail-bitingly narrow victory of 140 to 136. But is it possible? You need Fate to get as few cards \nas possible for each one you take. You can start with the 22 and 14. With the 7 gone, \nyou can take the 21, then the 15. You still need these, and the next one\nyou take will give Fate two cards. That’s okay though. Try the 16, for example,\nand Fate gets the 4 and the 8, but you’ll still get the 12, the 18,\nand the 20. Following similar reasoning, you could take the 23 on your first turn\nand win the 10 or the 6. But claiming more than one\nreward is impossible. So do you take wealth, love,\nor break the curse?

If left untreated, it kills\nabout half of those it infects. It can spread through pretty much\nevery fluid your body makes, including blood and sweat. Even the dead can transmit the disease,\noften doing so at their own funerals. On December 26th, 2013, a two-year-old boy\nin southern Guinea got sick. Just two days later, he died. It took local doctors working \nwith the international community four months to discover \nthat Ebola was to blame, largely because it had never before been\ndetected outside of Central Africa. In those four months, Ebola gained \na head start that would prove devastating. The outbreak lasted two years and mushroomed into the largest\nEbola epidemic in recorded history. More than 28,000 people contracted\nthe disease and over 11,000 died. In 2013, Guinea had no formal\nemergency response system, few trained contact tracers,\nand no rapid tests, border screenings,\nor licensed vaccine for Ebola. After that epidemic, Guinea, with the support of the US \nand other international partners, completely overhauled \ntheir epidemic response system. And in January 2021, that system\nfaced its first real test. It started when a nurse in southern Guinea\ndeveloped a headache, vomiting, and fever. A few days later, she died. As dictated by traditional\nburial practices, her family prepared her body \nfor the funeral. Within a week, the nurse’s husband\nand other family members started experiencing symptoms. Health officials suspected Ebola much\nquicker than in 2013 and ordered tests. They came back positive, and Guinea activated its epidemic \nalert system the next day. Then, lots of things\nhappened very quickly. Guinea’s National Agency \nfor Health Security activated 38 district-level \nemergency operations centers, as well as a national one. Teams of epidemiologists and\ncontact tracers began the painstaking job of figuring out exactly who was\nexposed and when, generating a list of 23 initial contacts\nthat quickly grew to over 1,100. Advanced rapid testing capacity spun \nup in the city where the outbreak started. At Guinea’s borders\nwith Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, public health workers screened\nmore than 2 million travelers. A large-scale vaccination\ncampaign was started. And, finally, more than 900\ncommunity mobilizers alerted people of the outbreak and suggested alternative burial practices\nthat were acceptable to the community and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola. Thanks to all these measures, the 2021 outbreak ended\njust four months after it began. Only 23 people contracted Ebola;\nonly 12 died. That's less than 1% of the deaths\nin the prior outbreak. The 2021 outbreak cost \n$100 million to control— which sounds like a lot\nbut pales in comparison to the global economic cost\nof the previous outbreak: $53 billion. So should every country just copy\nGuinea’s approach? Not exactly. It is always important to respond\nto an outbreak quickly, so an early warning system is essential. But beyond that, a successful response\ncan look very different for different diseases \nin different countries. For example, Brazil quenched\nan outbreak of yellow fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, primarily by mounting a massive\nvaccination campaign. That strategy worked well for Brazil because it’s one of the major global\nproducers of the yellow fever vaccine, and its population was accustomed\nto regular, routine vaccinations. But for many diseases, you don't even\nneed a mass vaccination program. In August of 2021, a truck driver tested\npositive for cholera in Burkina Faso. Health care workers alerted \nthe government that same day and contact tracing began immediately. Cholera is caused by a bacterium, so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those\nexposed or potentially exposed. This extremely fast response \nstopped the outbreak just a few weeks after it started. Cholera often rears its head\nin West Africa— in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases\nand more than 3,700 deaths. Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared,\nthey had zero deaths that year. Zero. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, \nhealth officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven\noutbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some\nanimal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks. Villagers used an app to alert health\nauthorities about outbreaks in animals. Over the course of 16 months,\n36 animal outbreaks were identified. For any outbreak response system\nto be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued,\nand ultimately used by communities. That means reaching people where they are,\nin the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs,\nand practices with which they live. Perhaps most importantly, we can't\nexpect to do nothing for years and then just swing into action\nwhen an outbreak occurs. One of the best ways to save lives is to\ninvest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When left untreated, Ebola kills what percentage of those it infects?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "75%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100%"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why was the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Guinea so catastrophic?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There was no formal response system."}, {"label": "B", "text": "There were few trained contact tracers."}, {"label": "C", "text": "There was no licensed vaccine."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How long did the 2021 Ebola outbreak in Guinea last?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4 months"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6 months"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 year"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2 years"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How did Burkina Faso prevent a widespread cholera outbreak in 2021?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A mass vaccination program"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Strict quarantine rules"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Quick distribution of antibiotics to those exposed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What should be at the foundation of all outbreak response systems?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vaccine research and development"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Effective communication strategies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prevention of spillover events from animal populations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Investment in lasting health infrastructure"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 103, "lesson": 18, "title": "Why were there three popes at the same time? - Joëlle Rollo-Koster", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-were-there-three-popes-at-the-same-time-joelle-rollo-koster", "transcript": {"en": "For almost two millennia,\nthe Pope has been a figure of supreme spiritual authority\nfor Catholics around the world. But in the late 14th century, \nCatholics found themselves with not one, not two, but three popes. Where did this plethora of popes\ncome from? And who among them was\nthe genuine article? The origins of this papal predicament\nbegan in 1296, when France’s King Philip IV decided\nto raise taxes on the Church. Given the clergy’s political power, this offended Pope Boniface VIII,\nleading him to write the “Unam Sanctam”: a radical decree asserting the Pope’s\ntotal supremacy over earthly rulers. But King Philip struck back. He declared Boniface a heretic and tried\nto have him arrested in a violent raid. Boniface survived the assault,\nbut died soon after. And following a short-lived successor,\nPope Clement V was elected in 1305. A French diplomat seeking peace in the war\nbetween England and his homeland, Clement wanted to stay close\nto the conflict and escape the demands of Rome. So in 1309, he moved the seat \nof the papacy to Avignon— a city close to France but owned\nby a vassal of the Church. The papacy remained here \nfor the terms of seven popes until the reigning Pope finally returned\nto Italy in 1376. But just several months after his arrival,\nhe suddenly died. This shocking development meant a new\npope had to be elected immediately— and in Rome, where there hadn’t been\na papal election in over 70 years. The Romans were determined \nto elect one of their own and restore Rome as the seat\nof Western Christendom. Local officials pressured cardinals\nto choose an Italian pope, while rowdy mobs raided the conclave\nand plundered the papal wine cellar. Amidst this chaos, the cardinals elected\nthe Neapolitan Archbishop of Bari to become Pope Urban VI. Initially, Urban was seen \nas a safe choice. But he quickly proved to be a reformer who\nsought to limit the cardinal’s finances. Desperate to maintain \ntheir luxurious lifestyles, the cardinals declared \nthe recent election illegitimate, since it was decided under pressure\nfrom the Roman mob. They denounced Urban as a usurper and held a new conclave \nto elect Pope Clement VII. Clement attempted to excommunicate Urban, but he refused to recognize\nthe authority of Clement or his greedy cardinals. Urban named new cardinals to his court \nand entrenched himself in Rome while Clement and his supporters \nreturned to Avignon. The schism had officially begun. Western Christendom now had two capitals,\nAvignon and Rome, each with their own Pope\nand court of cardinals. As popes from each line died, \ntheir cardinals appointed successors, continuing the crisis for decades. This strange situation didn't impact\nmost ordinary Catholics, as there were no significant\ndoctrinal splits. Instead, the drama played \nout in the diplomatic realm. European rulers were forced \nto choose sides, as both popes vied \nfor spiritual and political supremacy. Only a pope had the authority \nto call a general council to officially resolve the issue, and both sides refused to take this step. So in 1409, a group of cardinals \nfrom France and Rome took matters into their own hands. They claimed that since both\npopes were disputed, cardinals did have the right\nto call a council. And at their gathering these cardinals\ndeposed the pretenders and elected a new Pope. Unfortunately, both Avignon’s Pope \nand Rome’s Pope refused to recognize this council. So instead of solving the crisis, \nthe number of popes rose to three. This unusual arrangement \nlasted five more years, until the Council of Constance in 1417. Here, the popes from the Roman line\nand recently created third line resigned and agreed to unite the church\nunder a new Pope— Martin V.

To quash the threat, the Sultan brings \nhis war elephants to battle. But it’s said that the explosions \nof Babur’s cannons and muskets startled the elephants and they trampled\nthe Sultan’s own army. Babur had long harbored ambitions\nof building his own empire. Though he was descended from some\nof the world’s most successful conquerors, he struggled to gain a foothold among the many ambitious princes\nin Central Asia. So he turned his attention to India, where his descendants stayed \nand built the Mughal Empire, one of the wealthiest and most powerful\nstates in the early modern world and home to nearly a quarter\nof the global population. Babur died just four years \nafter that fateful battle, but his own memoirs and the work \nof his descendants immortalized him in colorful fashion. His daughter, Gulbadan, recalled\nin her own memoir how Babur— having recently given up drinking— filled a newly-constructed pool \nwith lemonade rather than wine. His grandson, Akbar, commissioned \nexquisite miniature paintings of Babur’s stories— one depicted the empire’s\nfounder riding through his camp, drunkenly slumped over his horse. It was Akbar who consolidated \nMughal power. He established protections for peasants— which in turn increased their productivity\nand generated more tax revenue— and embarked on military campaigns \nto expand Mughal territory. Princes who swore allegiance to him \nwere rewarded, while he made brutal examples \nof those who resisted, killing them and many of their subjects. His conquests opened access \nto port cities on the Indian Ocean, which connected the Mughals to Arab,\nChinese, Ottoman, and European traders, bringing in incalculable wealth, including silver and new crops\nfrom the Americas. As the Muslim ruler of a diverse,\nmultiethnic empire, Akbar worked to create internal cohesion\nby appointing members of the Hindu majority to high positions\nin his government, marrying a Hindu bride, and distributing translated copies \nof the “Mahabharata,” an ancient Indian epic poem,\nto his Muslim nobles. Akbar also hosted lively religious debates\nwhere Sunni and Shia Muslims, Hindus, Jains, Zoroastrians, and the newly arrived \nPortuguese Jesuit missionaries defended the merits \nof their respective faiths. While most participants viewed this\nas an intellectual exercise, Portuguese missionaries were disappointed\nby their failure to convert Akbar. The Mughals built \narchitectural masterpieces such as the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, a palace three kilometers around,\nthat housed 50,000 people and contained the magnificent gold\nand jewel-encrusted Peacock Throne. Just the throne took \nseven years to construct. During its first 180 years,\nthe Mughals had only six rulers, which contributed \nto the empire’s stability. When the fourth emperor, Jahangir, struggled with alcohol \nand opioid addiction, his wife, Nur Jahan, \ntook the reins as co-ruler. When a traitorous general captured \nher husband in an attempted coup, she negotiated his release and rallied\nthe army to stop the rebellion. She once led a hunting party to track down\na tiger that was terrorizing a village, leading one poet to write: “Though Nur Jahan be in form of a woman/\nIn the ranks of men she’s a tiger-slayer.” Following the death of the sixth emperor,\nAurangzeb, in 1707, seven emperors took the throne\nover the next 21 years. These frequent transitions \nof power reflected the larger political, economic, \nsocial, and environmental crises that plagued the empire \nthroughout the 18th century. In response to this turmoil, regional leaders started refusing to pay\ntaxes and broke away from Mughal control. The British East India Company offered\nmilitary support to these regional rulers, which in turn increased the company's\npolitical influence, enabling it to eventually take\ndirect control of Bengal, one of the wealthiest regions in India. By the 19th century, the East India\nCompany had massive political influence and a large standing army, \nwhich included Indian troops. When these troops revolted in 1857, aiming to force out the British\nand restore Mughal influence, the British government intervened, replacing company rule \nwith direct colonial rule, deposing the last Mughal emperor\nand sending him into exile. And so, over three centuries \nafter its founding, the Mughal Empire came to an end."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What enabled Babur to defeat Sultan Ibrahim Lodi in 1526?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Babur employed creative siege tactics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Babur had gunpowder weapons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Babur had a much larger army"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Babur defeated Lodi in one-on-one combat"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which ruler consolidated Mughal power?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Akbar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Babur"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jahangir"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aurangzeb"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who participated in Akbar’s religious debates?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sunni and Shia Muslims"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hindus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jesuit Missionaries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What architectural masterpiece was built by the Mughals?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Blue Mosque"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Hagia Sophia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Taj Mahal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Golden Temple"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who officially ended the Mughal Empire in 1857?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The British"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Guptas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Safavids"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Dutch"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 103, "lesson": 20, "title": "Why do we have crooked teeth when our ancestors didn’t? - G. Richard Scott", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-we-have-crooked-teeth-when-our-ancestors-didn-t-g-richard-scott", "transcript": {"en": "All these ancient skulls have\nperfectly straight teeth, despite almost certainly\nnever sporting braces. And this isn't some strange sample. According to the fossil record, ancient humans usually had straight teeth, complete with third molars—\nor wisdom teeth. In fact, the dental dilemmas\nthat fuel the demand for braces and wisdom teeth extractions today\nappear to be recent developments. So what happened? While it’s nearly impossible\nto know for sure, scientists have a hypothesis. A couple million years ago, the ancestors of modern humans lived\na subsistence lifestyle. Their teeth and jaws had to work hard\nto make the food they ate digestible. Indeed, the surfaces of many of their \nteeth show extensive wear and flattening. They also had larger jaws\nand teeth overall. At some point, they began using tools\nand fire to cook and prepare food, which helped break it down. A lot more time passed and,\naround 12,000 years ago, some humans started farming\nand domesticating animals and plants. Over the course of several thousand years, it became more common for people\nto process and refine their food. Milling technologies helped remove\nthe tougher parts of grains, like the germ and bran\nfrom rice and wheat. Fast forward to the industrial Revolution, and technological innovations dramatically\naccelerated these processes. In a relatively short time, many human mouths were relieved\nof a great deal of their grinding, crushing, \nand pulverizing duties. And interestingly, it was around this time that tooth crookedness\nappears to have become more common. Examining fossils\nspanning millions of years of evolution, researchers have observed\na gradual decrease in tooth and jaw size in humans and our ancestors. Many think that, \nfor most of human history, dietary shifts— like the introduction\nof meat and the advent of cooking— were gradual, and that changes in tooth and jaw size\nbasically kept pace with one another. But with the more recent revolutions\nin agricultural and culinary habits, that relationship changed. As the theory goes, \nover a relatively short period, some human populations saw\na decrease in jawbone size, while teeth stayed roughly the same size, meaning they're left vying\nfor limited space. When they do grow in,\nthey may displace others and get jostled into some\neccentric positions. And then wisdom teeth, which are usually\nthe last to make their debut, seem to only complicate things further. In many cases, they have little\nor no space to emerge. This can lead to impacted wisdom teeth, which may cause discomfort and infections\nif not surgically removed. So larger jaws appear to be associated\nwith greater chewing demands. And many scientists think that as people's\ndiets have become less chewy, their jaws have gotten smaller—\nand that this has led to dental crowding, resulting in dental crookedness\nand impacted wisdom teeth. This hypothesis has been supported\nby some preliminary experimental data. In a 1983 study, researchers\nraised 43 squirrel monkeys on diets of either naturally tough\nor artificially soft food. Those fed softer food had \nmore crowded premolars, rotated or displaced teeth, \nand narrower dental arches. And a 2004 study similarly observed\nthat hyraxes raised on cooked foods experienced roughly 10% less growth\nin facial areas involved in chewing compared to those given raw \nand dried foods. In other words, the issue at large\nseems to be environmental— or one of lifestyle—\ninstead of a genetic one, though heritable factors may be at play\nin some instances. It’s estimated that somewhere \nbetween 30 to 60% of people today experience some level of tooth crowding. But this trend varies \nacross global populations. Some people naturally \nnever have wisdom teeth. And some don’t experience \ntooth crowding or crookedness and still get their wisdom teeth\nwithout a hitch. This seems to coincide with diets\nthat are less processed. So how can we prevent \ntooth crowding early, using lifestyle changes and orthodontics? Well, it’s certainly\nsomething to chew over."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately when did humans switch from a diet based on hunting/gathering to one based on domesticated plants and animals?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50,000 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30,000 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20,000 years ago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12,000 years ago"}, {"label": "E", "text": "6,000 years ago"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What historical age is associated with the production of highly processed foods?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Neolithic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bronze Age"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Age of Discovery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Industrial Revolution"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Space Age"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "About what percent of people in modern populations have some dental crowding?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10-15%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "70-85%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20-40%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30-60%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What experimental animal was used to demonstrate how a diet composed of softer foods led to tooth crowding?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Guinea pig"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Squirrel monkey"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rabbit"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Rhesus monkey"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following innovations in human evolution contributed to a reduction jaw size?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Meat in the diet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fire for cooking"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Domesticated plants and animals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Highly processed foods"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

You know? Terminator? You know, that might be\nsomething to consider, but that's a distant threat. Or, we fret about digital surveillance with metaphors from the past. \"1984,\" George Orwell's \"1984,\" it's hitting the bestseller lists again. It's a great book, but it's not the correct dystopia\nfor the 21st century. What we need to fear most is not what artificial intelligence\nwill do to us on its own, but how the people in power\nwill use artificial intelligence to control us and to manipulate us in novel, sometimes hidden, subtle and unexpected ways. Much of the technology that threatens our freedom\nand our dignity in the near-term future is being developed by companies in the business of capturing\nand selling our data and our attention to advertisers and others: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Tencent. Now, artificial intelligence has started\nbolstering their business as well. And it may seem\nlike artificial intelligence is just the next thing after online ads. It's not. It's a jump in category. It's a whole different world, and it has great potential. It could accelerate our understanding\nof many areas of study and research. But to paraphrase\na famous Hollywood philosopher, \"With prodigious potential\ncomes prodigious risk.\" Now let's look at a basic fact\nof our digital lives, online ads. Right? We kind of dismiss them. They seem crude, ineffective. We've all had the experience\nof being followed on the web by an ad based on something\nwe searched or read. You know, you look up a pair of boots and for a week, those boots are following\nyou around everywhere you go. Even after you succumb and buy them,\nthey're still following you around. We're kind of inured to that kind\nof basic, cheap manipulation. We roll our eyes and we think,\n\"You know what? These things don't work.\" Except, online, the digital technologies are not just ads. Now, to understand that,\nlet's think of a physical world example. You know how, at the checkout counters\nat supermarkets, near the cashier, there's candy and gum\nat the eye level of kids? That's designed to make them\nwhine at their parents just as the parents\nare about to sort of check out. Now, that's a persuasion architecture. It's not nice, but it kind of works. That's why you see it\nin every supermarket. Now, in the physical world, such persuasion architectures\nare kind of limited, because you can only put\nso many things by the cashier. Right? And the candy and gum,\nit's the same for everyone, even though it mostly works only for people who have\nwhiny little humans beside them. In the physical world,\nwe live with those limitations. In the digital world, though, persuasion architectures\ncan be built at the scale of billions and they can target, infer, understand and be deployed at individuals one by one by figuring out your weaknesses, and they can be sent\nto everyone's phone private screen, so it's not visible to us. And that's different. And that's just one of the basic things\nthat artificial intelligence can do. Now, let's take an example. Let's say you want to sell\nplane tickets to Vegas. Right? So in the old world, you could think\nof some demographics to target based on experience\nand what you can guess. You might try to advertise to, oh, men between the ages of 25 and 35, or people who have\na high limit on their credit card, or retired couples. Right? That's what you would do in the past. With big data and machine learning, that's not how it works anymore. So to imagine that, think of all the data\nthat Facebook has on you: every status update you ever typed, every Messenger conversation, every place you logged in from, all your photographs\nthat you uploaded there. If you start typing something\nand change your mind and delete it, Facebook keeps those\nand analyzes them, too. Increasingly, it tries\nto match you with your offline data. It also purchases\na lot of data from data brokers. It could be everything\nfrom your financial records to a good chunk of your browsing history. Right? In the US,\nsuch data is routinely collected, collated and sold. In Europe, they have tougher rules. So what happens then is, by churning through all that data,\nthese machine-learning algorithms -- that's why they're called\nlearning algorithms -- they learn to understand\nthe characteristics of people who purchased tickets to Vegas before. When they learn this from existing data, they also learn\nhow to apply this to new people. So if they're presented with a new person, they can classify whether that person\nis likely to buy a ticket to Vegas or not. Fine. You're thinking,\nan offer to buy tickets to Vegas. I can ignore that. But the problem isn't that. The problem is, we no longer really understand\nhow these complex algorithms work. We don't understand\nhow they're doing this categorization. It's giant matrices,\nthousands of rows and columns, maybe millions of rows and columns, and not the programmers and not anybody who looks at it, even if you have all the data, understands anymore\nhow exactly it's operating any more than you'd know\nwhat I was thinking right now if you were shown\na cross section of my brain. It's like we're not programming anymore, we're growing intelligence\nthat we don't truly understand. And these things only work\nif there's an enormous amount of data, so they also encourage\ndeep surveillance on all of us so that the machine learning\nalgorithms can work. That's why Facebook wants\nto collect all the data it can about you. The algorithms work better. So let's push that Vegas example a bit. What if the system\nthat we do not understand was picking up that it's easier\nto sell Vegas tickets to people who are bipolar\nand about to enter the manic phase. Such people tend to become\noverspenders, compulsive gamblers. They could do this, and you'd have no clue\nthat's what they were picking up on. I gave this example\nto a bunch of computer scientists once and afterwards, one of them came up to me. He was troubled and he said,\n\"That's why I couldn't publish it.\" I was like, \"Couldn't publish what?\" He had tried to see whether you can indeed\nfigure out the onset of mania from social media posts\nbefore clinical symptoms, and it had worked, and it had worked very well, and he had no idea how it worked\nor what it was picking up on. Now, the problem isn't solved\nif he doesn't publish it, because there are already companies that are developing\nthis kind of technology, and a lot of the stuff\nis just off the shelf. This is not very difficult anymore. Do you ever go on YouTube\nmeaning to watch one video and an hour later you've watched 27? You know how YouTube\nhas this column on the right that says, \"Up next\" and it autoplays something? It's an algorithm picking what it thinks\nthat you might be interested in and maybe not find on your own. It's not a human editor. It's what algorithms do. It picks up on what you have watched\nand what people like you have watched, and infers that that must be\nwhat you're interested in, what you want more of, and just shows you more. It sounds like a benign\nand useful feature, except when it isn't. So in 2016, I attended rallies\nof then-candidate Donald Trump to study as a scholar\nthe movement supporting him. I study social movements,\nso I was studying it, too. And then I wanted to write something\nabout one of his rallies, so I watched it a few times on YouTube. YouTube started recommending to me and autoplaying to me\nwhite supremacist videos in increasing order of extremism. If I watched one, it served up one even more extreme and autoplayed that one, too. If you watch Hillary Clinton\nor Bernie Sanders content, YouTube recommends\nand autoplays conspiracy left, and it goes downhill from there. Well, you might be thinking,\nthis is politics, but it's not. This isn't about politics. This is just the algorithm\nfiguring out human behavior. I once watched a video\nabout vegetarianism on YouTube and YouTube recommended\nand autoplayed a video about being vegan. It's like you're never\nhardcore enough for YouTube. (Laughter) So what's going on? Now, YouTube's algorithm is proprietary, but here's what I think is going on. The algorithm has figured out that if you can entice people into thinking that you can\nshow them something more hardcore, they're more likely to stay on the site watching video after video\ngoing down that rabbit hole while Google serves them ads. Now, with nobody minding\nthe ethics of the store, these sites can profile people who are Jew haters, who think that Jews are parasites and who have such explicit\nanti-Semitic content, and let you target them with ads. They can also mobilize algorithms to find for you look-alike audiences, people who do not have such explicit\nanti-Semitic content on their profile but who the algorithm detects\nmay be susceptible to such messages, and lets you target them with ads, too. Now, this may sound\nlike an implausible example, but this is real. ProPublica investigated this and found that you can indeed\ndo this on Facebook, and Facebook helpfully\noffered up suggestions on how to broaden that audience. BuzzFeed tried it for Google,\nand very quickly they found, yep, you can do it on Google, too. And it wasn't even expensive. The ProPublica reporter\nspent about 30 dollars to target this category. So last year, Donald Trump's\nsocial media manager disclosed that they were using Facebook dark posts\nto demobilize people, not to persuade them, but to convince them not to vote at all. And to do that,\nthey targeted specifically, for example, African-American men\nin key cities like Philadelphia, and I'm going to read\nexactly what he said. I'm quoting. They were using \"nonpublic posts whose viewership the campaign controls so that only the people\nwe want to see it see it. We modeled this. It will dramatically affect her ability\nto turn these people out.\" What's in those dark posts? We have no idea. Facebook won't tell us. So Facebook also algorithmically\narranges the posts that your friends put on Facebook,\nor the pages you follow. It doesn't show you\neverything chronologically. It puts the order in the way\nthat the algorithm thinks will entice you to stay on the site longer. Now, so this has a lot of consequences. You may be thinking\nsomebody is snubbing you on Facebook. The algorithm may never\nbe showing your post to them. The algorithm is prioritizing\nsome of them and burying the others. Experiments show that what the algorithm picks to show you\ncan affect your emotions. But that's not all. It also affects political behavior. So in 2010, in the midterm elections, Facebook did an experiment\non 61 million people in the US that was disclosed after the fact. So some people were shown,\n\"Today is election day,\" the simpler one, and some people were shown\nthe one with that tiny tweak with those little thumbnails of your friends who clicked on \"I voted.\" This simple tweak. OK? So the pictures were the only change, and that post shown just once turned out an additional 340,000 voters in that election, according to this research as confirmed by the voter rolls. A fluke? No. Because in 2012,\nthey repeated the same experiment. And that time, that civic message shown just once turned out an additional 270,000 voters. For reference, the 2016\nUS presidential election was decided by about 100,000 votes. Now, Facebook can also\nvery easily infer what your politics are, even if you've never\ndisclosed them on the site. Right? These algorithms\ncan do that quite easily. What if a platform with that kind of power decides to turn out supporters\nof one candidate over the other? How would we even know about it? Now, we started from someplace\nseemingly innocuous -- online adds following us around -- and we've landed someplace else. As a public and as citizens, we no longer know\nif we're seeing the same information or what anybody else is seeing, and without a common basis of information, little by little, public debate is becoming impossible, and we're just at\nthe beginning stages of this. These algorithms can quite easily infer things like your people's ethnicity, religious and political views,\npersonality traits, intelligence, happiness,\nuse of addictive substances, parental separation, age and genders, just from Facebook likes. These algorithms can identify protesters even if their faces\nare partially concealed. These algorithms may be able\nto detect people's sexual orientation just from their dating profile pictures. Now, these are probabilistic guesses, so they're not going\nto be 100 percent right, but I don't see the powerful resisting\nthe temptation to use these technologies just because there are\nsome false positives, which will of course create\na whole other layer of problems. Imagine what a state can do with the immense amount of data\nit has on its citizens. China is already using\nface detection technology to identify and arrest people. And here's the tragedy: we're building this infrastructure\nof surveillance authoritarianism merely to get people to click on ads. And this won't be\nOrwell's authoritarianism. This isn't \"1984.\" Now, if authoritarianism\nis using overt fear to terrorize us, we'll all be scared, but we'll know it, we'll hate it and we'll resist it. But if the people in power\nare using these algorithms to quietly watch us, to judge us and to nudge us, to predict and identify\nthe troublemakers and the rebels, to deploy persuasion\narchitectures at scale and to manipulate individuals one by one using their personal, individual\nweaknesses and vulnerabilities, and if they're doing it at scale through our private screens so that we don't even know what our fellow citizens\nand neighbors are seeing, that authoritarianism\nwill envelop us like a spider's web and we may not even know we're in it. So Facebook's market capitalization is approaching half a trillion dollars. It's because it works great\nas a persuasion architecture. But the structure of that architecture is the same whether you're selling shoes or whether you're selling politics. The algorithms do not know the difference. The same algorithms set loose upon us to make us more pliable for ads are also organizing our political,\npersonal and social information flows, and that's what's got to change. Now, don't get me wrong, we use digital platforms\nbecause they provide us with great value. I use Facebook to keep in touch\nwith friends and family around the world. I've written about how crucial\nsocial media is for social movements. I have studied how\nthese technologies can be used to circumvent censorship around the world. But it's not that the people who run,\nyou know, Facebook or Google are maliciously and deliberately trying to make the country\nor the world more polarized and encourage extremism. I read the many\nwell-intentioned statements that these people put out. But it's not the intent or the statements\npeople in technology make that matter, it's the structures\nand business models they're building. And that's the core of the problem. Either Facebook is a giant con\nof half a trillion dollars and ads don't work on the site, it doesn't work\nas a persuasion architecture, or its power of influence\nis of great concern. It's either one or the other. It's similar for Google, too. So what can we do? This needs to change. Now, I can't offer a simple recipe, because we need to restructure the whole way our\ndigital technology operates. Everything from the way\ntechnology is developed to the way the incentives,\neconomic and otherwise, are built into the system. We have to face and try to deal with the lack of transparency\ncreated by the proprietary algorithms, the structural challenge\nof machine learning's opacity, all this indiscriminate data\nthat's being collected about us. We have a big task in front of us. We have to mobilize our technology, our creativity and yes, our politics so that we can build\nartificial intelligence that supports us in our human goals but that is also constrained\nby our human values. And I understand this won't be easy. We might not even easily agree\non what those terms mean. But if we take seriously how these systems that we\ndepend on for so much operate, I don't see how we can postpone\nthis conversation anymore. These structures are organizing how we function and they're controlling what we can and we cannot do. And many of these ad-financed platforms, they boast that they're free. In this context, it means\nthat we are the product that's being sold. We need a digital economy where our data and our attention is not for sale to the highest-bidding\nauthoritarian or demagogue. (Applause) So to go back to\nthat Hollywood paraphrase, we do want the prodigious potential of artificial intelligence\nand digital technology to blossom, but for that, we must face\nthis prodigious menace, open-eyed and now. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

They noted that Kenya had repeatedly\nrequested the return of stolen papers, which the British government had refused. In fact, many historians suspected\nthere were gaps in the archives. As a result, the court ordered the release\nof any relevant documents. And, days later, British officials\nacknowledged that 1,500 pertinent files were being held \nin a high-security archive. It soon became clear that these \nwere just a small sample of documents Britain hid\nbetween the 1950s and 70s, while former colonies \ndeclared independence, as part of a widespread colonial British \npolicy called Operation Legacy. The policy was for British colonial\nofficers to destroy or remove documentation that \nmight incriminate Britain and be of strategic value\nto the new governments. They were instructed to destroy, alter, or secretly transport\nthese papers to the UK. Documents slated for destruction\nwere to be burnt to ashes or sunk in weighted crates far from shore. During the trial, between 2010 and 2013, an independent historian revealed \nthey had located more than 20,000 previously hidden \nOperation Legacy files from 37 former colonies. Finally, an estimated 1.2 million \ncolonial files, sprawling kilometers in the archive’s \nso-called “Special Collections,” were also exposed. And these were only the documents\nthat British forces kept. How many were destroyed— \nand what information they contained— remains unknown. About 3.5 tons of colonial documents \nwere slated for incineration in Kenya. Ultimately, Operation Legacy’s objective\nwas to obscure critical aspects of the truth. In the words of Britain’s\nattorney-general in Kenya, “If we are going to sin, \nwe must sin quietly.” So, what really happened in Kenya? Beginning in 1895, the British\nadministration forcibly removed people from their traditional lands, giving the most fertile areas to European\nsettlers to establish large-scale farms. They mandated forced labor systems, implemented reservations \nfor Indigenous African peoples, and restricted their movement. Kenyan people resisted \nthese incursions from the start and grew increasingly organized over time. One movement, \nthe Kenya Land and Freedom Army, aimed to forcibly remove white settlers\nand overthrow the colonial government. When the British declared \na state of emergency in 1952, they were giving themselves permission \nto take otherwise illegal special measures to regain control. The newly revealed \nOperation Legacy documents confirmed that people suspected \nof participating in the resistance were subjected to horrible abuses. Between 1952 and 1959, the British imprisoned \nover 80,000 people without trial, sentenced over 1,000 people convicted\nas terrorists to death, and imposed extreme surveillance\nand interrogation tactics. Some people were beaten to death. Others were raped or castrated. Many were shackled at the wrist for years. Children were killed. One person was burnt alive. Ndiku Mutwiwa Mutua testified \nto being castrated while handcuffed and blindfolded. Wambugu Wa Nyingi said he was\nsuspended upside-down, beaten, and had water thrown on his face\nuntil he could barely breathe. Jane Muthoni Mara said she was \nsexually violated with a hot bottle, and imprisoned for years without cause. In response to the new evidence, the British government issued\na formal apology, and made an out-of-court \nfinancial settlement with the 5,228 Kenyan claimants \nultimately involved in the case. The original five claimants \nhad made history— and paved the way for it \nto be rightfully rewritten. The uncovered files challenge fundamental\nmyths about British colonialism as a benevolent institution that brought\nfreedom and democracy to its subjects, then graciously gave them independence. Instead, the newly exposed evidence\nconfirms what many people knew to be true, because they lived it— and survived to rescue history\nfrom the ashes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In what year did a group of Kenyan citizens bring a petition to the British Prime Minister claiming human rights abuses dating back to the 1950s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1979"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1989"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1999"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2009"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Documents that would otherwise have been inherited by the British empire's former colonies were hidden or destroyed as part of what governmental program?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Operation Independence"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Operation Legacy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Operation Crown"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Operation Archive"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT part of the British occupation of Kenya at the end of the 19th century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Removal of Kenyans from traditional lands"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Forced labor systems"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Election of new local representatives"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Implementation of reservations for Indigenous Africans"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When the British declared a state of emergency in 1952, what tactics did they give themselves permission to use in response to Kenyan uprisings?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prison without trial"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Extreme surveillance and interrogation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Death sentences for individuals convicted as \"terrorists\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which myth about British colonialism is undermined by the discovery of documents recording human rights abuses in Kenya?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It was a benevolent institution that spread freedom and democracy."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It was a minor project in British history."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It was a lucrative endeavor for the British government."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It never happened.

But by the late 1960s, \nthey’d become extinct in the wild— the last herds struggling \nin meager habitats against hunters and competition \nfrom local livestock. Some small groups of Takhi\nsurvived in European zoos, but their extinction \nstill seemed inevitable. To prevent this terrible fate, a coalition of scientists and zoos\npulled together to start an international \nTakhi breeding program. By the 1990s, these collaborators\nin Europe and the US began releasing new generations \nof Asia’s ancient wild horse back into their native habitat. This Takhi revival was a world-famous\nconservation victory, but the full story is much more\ncomplicated than it first appears. And its twists and turns raise serious\nquestions about the role of zoos and what conservation even means. To get the whole story, \nwe need to start in the late 1800s when Russian explorer Nikolay Przhevalsky\nwas gifted the remains of one of these wild horses. Though the Takhi had long been\nknown to local Mongolians, European scientists were intrigued\nby the remains, which looked more like those of a donkey\nor zebra than any known domestic horse. They concluded the species was a sort\nof missing link between wild asses and modern horses. And as reports of the newly dubbed \nPrzhevalsky’s horse circulated through Europe and America, zoo proprietors became eager to acquire\nthe previously unknown species. At this time, zoos were focused primarily\non drawing visitors with exotic animals, and their exhibitions were more concerned\nwith entertainment than animal welfare. But in the early 1900s, the near\nextinction of the American bison and the total extinction of other species\nlike the passenger pigeon inspired zoos to rebrand \nas centers for conservation. And as it became clear that Przhevalsky’s\nhorse might be headed for a similar fate, zoos began breeding programs to sustain\nthe captive population. However, the individuals behind these\nprograms came to an interesting conclusion about how the horses should be bred. Like their colleagues, they believed\nthe species represented a missing link between modern domestic horses \nand their more primitive ancestors. They also knew that some of the horses in\ntheir collections weren’t purebred Takhi, and many didn’t even resemble \nthe species’ standard description. So breeders felt it was up to them\nto determine what a wild Takhi should look like, and breed them accordingly. Basing their work on just a few specimens\nand broad beliefs about what a primitive horse \nmight look like, they created a rigorous model \nfor the ideal Takhi. And over the 20th century, breeders in western zoos \nand private collections created a population \nof thousands of horses all carefully bred to share the same\nphysical characteristics. Of course, in their native habitat, wild Takhi had regularly interbred \nwith domesticated horses for millennia, producing a population with much\nmore diverse appearances. So when it was time to introduce \nthe Takhi to their ancestral home, they were quite different from the horses who’d been taken from those steppes\na century earlier. Complicating things even further, while these new Takhi herds were\nno longer in zoos, to this day, almost all \nremain closely monitored and controlled for their own protection. So in a strange way, it’s hard to say \nif these animals are actually in the wild or even if they’re truly Takhi. The story of the Takhi horse \nis not unique. In many of our conservation victories, it’s difficult to say exactly\nwhat was saved, and the role that zoos play \nin conservation can be very complicated. It's clear that zoos have been and can\ncontinue to be significant forces for animal preservation, especially efforts to save \ncharismatic animals from extinction. But today, the most direct\ncause of animal extinctions are humanity’s impacts on animal habitats\nand Earth’s climate. So if zoos truly want to help protect the\ndiversity of animal life on this planet, perhaps they should redirect their efforts to preserving the natural habitats\nthese animals so desperately need."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Takhi is what kind of animal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dog"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Horse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Antelope"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ox"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When did the Takhi become extinct in the wild?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In the late 1800s"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the early 1920s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the late 1960s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Around the year 2000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Although the Takhi being reintroduced into the wild are the descendants of specimens brought into captivity over a century ago, how should they be seen as quite different animals?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are the results of selective breeding programs that led to changes in the appearance of the animals."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Generations of living in captivity led to behavioral changes among the animals."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A focus on maintaining Takhi purity in zoos disregarded the fact that there had been a deep history of interbreeding between Takhi and domestic stock."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT one of the major goals of zoos in the 1800s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Education"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Science"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Conservation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Recreation"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What saved the Takhi from total extinction in the twentieth century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pocket populations of wild Takhi that survived with careful protection by conservation organizations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stopping the hunting of Takhi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Breeding programs primarily located in zoos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The killing of predators like wolves"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Suskind", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-a-poop-transplant-and-how-does-it-work-kathryn-m-stephenson-and-david-l-suskind", "transcript": {"en": "1,700 years ago, a Chinese\nalchemist named Ge Hong was renowned for his special soup that\ncould cure diarrhea-stricken patients. The stew was deep yellow,\nand had an intense aroma. And, like many family recipes,\nit had a secret ingredient. But in this case, that ingredient\ndidn’t come from the kitchen— it came from the bathroom. It might seem unwise to consume feces, and today, there aren’t many doctors \nwho would prescribe Ge Hong’s recipe. However, exciting new research suggests\nthat taking poop into the body in other ways might benefit our health. One such treatment \nis fecal microbial transplantation, and the secret to how it works\nlives in your gut. Trillions and trillions of bacteria, \nviruses, fungi, and archaea consider your bowels their home. Collectively, these microbes make \nup what’s known as your gut microbiome, and each of these organisms\npossesses dynamic, specialized abilities that seem to be essential for human life. They break down our food, make vitamins, train our immune system\nand circadian rhythm, and even protect us from infections. In return, they receive \na nice warm place to live, complete with an all-you-can-eat buffet. Some research suggests our microbiomes\nmight start forming in the womb, but if not, they certainly get\nstarted when we're born. During a vaginal birth, infants take \nin some of their mother’s fecal matter and microbe-filled fluids. From then on, our microbiomes \nare constantly diversifying with exposure to various \nfoods and environments. This is essential for maintaining \ngut health. If poor nutrition, chronic disease or\nantibiotics disturb this delicate balance, the body can become vulnerable to problems like bacteria and fungal overgrowth \nor infectious diarrhea. But infusing a new batch\nof microorganisms into the intestine seems to help reset the gut microbiome— this is where fecal microbial transplants\ncome into play. This line of treatment is still very new, and there are tons of unanswered\nquestions about how it works. So currently, the US Food and Drug\nAdministration only allows doctors to use fecal transplants experimentally for battling one of the toughest \ngut infections— antibiotic-resistant \nClostridiodes difficile. This infectious bacterium forms spores in\nthe colon that are immune to antibiotics and very difficult to destroy. Patients dealing with this infection can\nexperience months of intermittent fevers alongside bouts of abdominal cramping \nand extreme diarrhea despite antibiotic treatment. So when symptoms get this bad, it’s time\nfor a fecal microbial transplant. To start the process, a gastroenterologist first retrieves \nsome feces, typically from a stool bank. These frozen samples are particularly\nimpressive number twos— the selected donors go \nthrough a strict process to ensure their samples \nare infection-free. In fact, these protective protocols\nare so stringent, one prominent stool bank’s \nacceptance rate is less than 3%. Next, the gastroenterologist gets \nthat sample inside the patient via a pill, or, more commonly, a tube \ninto the stomach or colon. Finally, the transplanted microbes \nmigrate through the tract until they find the colon, where they quickly multiply\nand displace the infectious invader. This process is so effective that it cures\nover 80% of patients in just one treatment. Because each stool sample is unique, the FDA still classifies fecal transplants\nas an experimental treatment rather than a formal medication. But promising research in rodents \nsuggests new ways we might use fecal bacteriotherapy\nin the future. For example, fecal transplants \nfrom non-diabetic mice improved insulin resistance in mice\nwith type 2 diabetes. Similarly, some studies have shown\nmice exhibiting anxiety and depression become calmer after transplants \nfrom their less anxious peers. Scientists studying humans have \neven started finding different microbial patterns associated with various intestinal,\nautoimmune, oncologic, and even psychiatric disorders. So, it seems entirely possible\nthat altering a patient’s microbiome could allow for multiple new modes\nof treatment. We still have a lot to learn about what\nmakes the “best” gut microbiome, or the most beneficial fecal transplants. But for now, at least we can say\nthat our feces have a bright future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the #1 disease doctors currently recommend treating with a fecal microbial transplant?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Constipation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Inflammatory bowel disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A brand-new clostridium difficile infection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A treatment-resistant clostridium difficile infection "}, {"label": "E", "text": "Obesity"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Medical treatments have risks and benefits.
