{"page": 40, "lesson": 1, "title": "Should you trust unanimous decisions? - Derek Abbott", "category": "Data Analysis & Probability", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/should-you-trust-unanimous-decisions-derek-abbott", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine a police lineup\nwhere ten witnesses are asked to identify a bank robber\nthey glimpsed fleeing the crime scene. If six of them pick out the same person, there's a good chance \nthat's the real culprit, and if all ten make the same choice, you might think the case is rock solid, but you'd be wrong. For most of us, \nthis sounds pretty strange. After all, much of our society\nrelies on majority vote and consensus, whether it's politics, business, or entertainment. So it's natural to think\nthat more consensus is a good thing. And up until a certain point, \nit usually is. But sometimes, the closer you start to get\nto total agreement, the less reliable the result becomes. This is called the paradox of unanimity. The key to understanding \nthis apparent paradox is in considering the overall level \nof uncertainty involved in the type of situation \nyou're dealing with. If we asked witnesses to identify\nthe apple in this lineup, for example, we shouldn't be surprised \nby a unanimous verdict. But in cases where we have \nreason to expect some natural variance, we should also expect varied distribution. If you toss a coin one hundred times, you would expect to get heads\nsomewhere around 50% of the time. But if your results started \nto approach 100% heads, you'd suspect that something was wrong, not with your individual flips, but with the coin itself. Of course, suspect identifications aren't\nas random as coin tosses, but they're not as clear cut \nas telling apples from bananas, either. In fact, a 1994 study found \nthat up to 48% of witnesses tend to pick the wrong \nperson out of a lineup, even when many \nare confident in their choice. Memory based on short glimpses\ncan be unreliable, and we often overestimate \nour own accuracy. Knowing all this, a unanimous identification starts to seem\nless like certain guilt, and more like a systemic error, or bias in the lineup. And systemic errors don't just appear\nin matters of human judgement. From 1993-2008, the same female DNA was found \nin multiple crime scenes around Europe, incriminating an elusive killer\ndubbed the Phantom of Heilbronn. But the DNA evidence was so consistent\nprecisely because it was wrong. It turned out that the cotton swabs\nused to collect the DNA samples had all been accidentally contaminated\nby a woman working in the swab factory. In other cases, systematic errors arise\nthrough deliberate fraud, like the presidential referendum held\nby Saddam Hussein in 2002, which claimed a turnout of 100% of voters\nwith all 100% supposedly voting in favor of another seven-year term. When you look at it this way, the paradox of unanimity isn't actually\nall that paradoxical. Unanimous agreement \nis still theoretically ideal, especially in cases when you'd expect very\nlow odds of variability and uncertainty, but in practice, achieving it in situations where \nperfect agreement is highly unlikely should tell us that there's probably\nsome hidden factor affecting the system. Although we may strive for harmony\nand consensus, in many situations, error and disagreement\nshould be naturally expected. And if a perfect result seems too good\nto be true, it probably is."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Consider a bank robber fleeing from a bank and jumping into a car.

But there was something Charles Darwin\nfound even more impressive: the brain of an ant, which he called one of the most\nmarvelous atoms of matter in the world. If you find it hard to believe that\nsomething so tiny could have a complex brain, you're not alone. In his project to classify and describe\nall living things, Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus\nassumed insects had no brains at all. He was wrong, but understandably so. Insect brains are not only miniscule, but in many respects, \nthey function differently than our own. One of the most noticeable differences is that an insect that loses its head\ncan still walk, scratch itself, breathe, and even fly. This is because while our nervous system\nworks like a monarchy, with the brain calling the shots, the insect nervous system works\nmore like a decentralized federation. Many insect activities,\nlike walking or breathing, are coordinated by clusters of neurons,\nalso known as ganglia, along their bodies. Together with the brain, these local \nganglia form the insect nervous system. While an insect can do a lot with just\nits local ganglia, the brain is still crucial \nfor its survival. An insect's brain lets it perceive\nthe world through sight and smell. It also chooses suitable mates, remembers locations of food sources\nand hives, regulates communication, and even coordinates navigation\nover huge distances. And this vast diversity of behaviors is controlled by an organ \nthe size of the head of a pin, with less than one million neurons, compared to our 86 billion. But even though the insect brain\nis organized very differently from ours, there are some striking similarities. For example, most insects have\nsmell detectors on their antennae, similar to those found in human noses. And our primary olfactory brain regions\nlook and function rather similarly, with clusters of neurons activated\nand deactivated in precise timing to code for specific scents. Scientists have been astonished\nby these similarities because insects and humans are not\nvery closely related. In fact, our last common ancestor\nwas a simple worm-like creature that lived more than 500 million\nyears ago. So how did we end up\nwith such similar brain structures when our evolution took almost\nentirely different paths? Scientists call this phenomenon\nconvergent evolution. It's the same principle behind birds,\nbats, and bees separately evolving wings. Similar selective pressures can cause\nnatural selection to favor the same evolutionary strategy in species with vastly different \nevolutionary pasts. By studying the comparison between\ninsect and human brains, scientists can thus understand which of\nour brain functions are unique, and which are general solutions \nto evolutionary problems. But this is not the only reason scientists\nare fascinated by insect brains. Their small size and simplicity makes it \neasier to understand exactly how neurons work together \nin the brain. This is also valuable for engineers, who study the insect brain to help design\ncontrol systems for everything from self-flying airplanes\nto tiny search-and-rescue roach bots. So, size and complexity are not always\nthe most impressive things. The next time you try to swat a fly, take a moment to marvel at the efficiency\nof its tiny nervous system as it outsmarts your fancy brain."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Most insects smell using their:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "antennae"}, {"label": "B", "text": "nostrils"}, {"label": "C", "text": "feet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "tongue"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which features of insect brains are of particular interest for robotics engineers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hypothalamus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Simplicity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Evolutionary origin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Small size"}, {"label": "E", "text": "a) and b)"}, {"label": "F", "text": "b) and d)"}, {"label": "G", "text": "c) and d)"}], "correct_option": "F"}, {"question": "What do we call the independent evolution of similar features (such as sense of smell) in species of different origin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Convergent evolution"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Intelligent design"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Divergent evolution"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Parallel evolution"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Most insects smell using their:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Antennae"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nostrils"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Feet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tongue"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In the insect nervous system:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The brain controls almost all body functions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Local ganglia control all aspects of behavior"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Control of behavior is shared between the brain and local ganglia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is no brain"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which 18th-century naturalist, who formalized our current system of naming organisms, thought that insects didn’t have brains?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Charles Darwin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Carl Linnaeus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ernst Haeckel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Jean-Baptiste Lamarck"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 40, "lesson": 4, "title": "What is Minimalist Art And Why Does it Matter?", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/6JwHeTD1", "transcript": {"en": "So you see a few cubes sitting in an art gallery, and you think to yourself, \"This is the greatest hoax that anyone has ever pulled off.\" You immediately walk away, discouraged by the wide gulf between what you hope for when you walk into a museum and what they've presented to you. How did we get here? How could these cubes that the artist didn't even make with their own hands be important? This is the case for minimalism. First off, we're not talking about minimalism as a general sensibility\nor the life-changing magic of tidying up. We're talking about the art of a particular moment in time. Namely, the 1960s, when all of a sudden,\nthere was a lot of geometric, abstract art. Some of it was painting by artists\nlike Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly, but most of it was sculpture by artists like Donald Judd, Carl Andre, Dan Flavin, Anne Truitt, Robert Morris, Tony Smith,\nRonald Bladen, and Sol LeWitt. Art critics called it ABC art, object art, primary structures, and cool art, but the term minimalism prevailed. These artists never called their art minimalist, by the way, nor did they like the term, or the implication that the work\nwas so reductive that it was minimally art. But minimalism was a rejection of what came before. Specifically, abstract expressionism, which dominated the art market in the 1950s. These new artists wanted to remove expression completely, remove emotion, empty the work of idiosyncratic gesture, make it resistant to biographical reading. Their hard-edged, basic shapes and forms avoided allusion, metaphor, and overt symbolism. The forms were often repeated, one thing after another in regular, non-hierarchical arrangements, rejecting compositional balancing. No artist hemming and hawing over the canvas here. The objects were impersonal, many of them machine-made, fabricated from new and industrial materials. Sometimes this entailed ready-made units, like Andre's bricks, or Flavin's fluorescent tubes. They didn't want you to ooh and ah,\nor admire the handling of paint. As LeWitt once said, \"It is best that the basic unit \"be deliberately uninteresting.\" Robert Morris wrote that he could\nhear a resounding no at the time. \"No to transcendence and spiritual values, \"heroic scale, anguished decisions, \"historicizing narrative, valuable artifact, \"intelligent structure, interesting visual experience.\" But what they were saying yes to\nwas a new and startling realness. Abandoning the pedestal to dismantle\nthe separation between you and the art. Judd claimed these works are neither painting nor sculpture, but instead specific objects occupying real space. These objects aren't pointing to anything\nor referencing anything. Andre called his work a kind of plastic poetry, in which elements are combined to produce space. So there is no illusion of space, it just is space. Minimalism had its haters from the start. In 1967, art critic Michael Fried\nattacked the work for being theatrical. For him it was an object in a room\nthat had presence before a viewer, but it did not have what good art has, which is presentness, or, \"an instant of aesthetic experience \"which occurs in no real space or time at all.\" But Fried really just ended up affirming\nexactly what the artists were trying to do: proving how radical it really was. Despite its detractors, minimalism became all the rage. This geometric, unadorned style flowed throughout the worlds of fashion, theater, and design. In short, it was cool. And then because these artists were never trying to be minimalist to begin with, they moved on to other things\nand other kinds of art had its day. But minimalism changed things. For centuries, art had been trying to trick you, convince you that the hunk of rock\nwas something other than a hunk of rock. But not this. You feel like there's gotta be some secret to it, but there isn't. There's nothing to interpret. This is what it is. It wasn't supposed to look like art of the past, and it wasn't supposed to function like it either. With minimalism, meaning doesn't rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked. The meaning is in the context,\nand exists in your interaction with it. But minimalism is a resistant lover. It's just not that into you. It encourages observation, but doesn't draw you in, and it was never trying to. Remember, these objects were supposed to be emptied of prevention, of mastery, of the usual seduction between art and viewer, and of the grand, glorious traditions that preceded them. But the fetishization and commodification of minimalist art has complicated and polluted these ideas. What's less real than million-dollar plywood boxes? And yet, for me at least, minimalist art\ncan still impart a strong feeling, a feeling for space, light, for presence and absence. You're aware of your own body in the gallery\nas you've never been before. You notice that your position in the room\nshapes your perception of the thing. You appreciate the architecture and the spareness, and in a world filled with complexity and information and lots and lots of stuff, this is a balm. This is a world more simplified than the actual world is, and that I can appreciate."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What decade sparked the Minimalist art movement?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the 1950s"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the 1920s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the 1960s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the 1890s"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What were some other contemporary terms for Minimalist abstract art?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "ABC Art"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cool Art"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Object Art"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Primary Structures"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What were Minimalist artists embracing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "idiosyncratic gesture, biographical reading, personal experience"}, {"label": "B", "text": "allusion, illusion, metaphor, symbolism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "compositional narrative balance "}, {"label": "D", "text": "regular non-hierarchical arrangement of objects, \"realness\", industrial materials"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What decade sparked the Minimalist art movement?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the 1950s"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the 1920s"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the 1960s"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the 1890s"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What were some other contemporary terms for Minimalist abstract art?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "ABC Art"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cool Art"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Object Art"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Primary Structures"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What were Minimalist artists embracing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "idiosyncratic gesture, biographical reading, personal experience"}, {"label": "B", "text": "allusion, illusion, metaphor, symbolism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "compositional narrative balance "}, {"label": "D", "text": "regular non-hierarchical arrangement of objects, \"realness\", industrial materials"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t\nthere because you need them but because your animal ancestors did.\nNo longer serving their previous function but not costly enough to have disappeared,\nthese remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by\nnatural selection. With your arm on a flat surface, push your\nthumb against your pinky and tip your hand slightly up.\nIf you see a raised band in the middle of the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle\nin your forearm. That tendon you see connects to the palmaris\nlongus, a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing\non one or both of their arms. It doesn’t make them any weaker though.\nThere’s no difference in grip strength. In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that\nsurgeons will take out so they can use it in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries.\nYou can find the palmaris longus across mammal species, but it’s most developed among those\nthat use their forelimbs to move around. In primates, that means the muscle is longer\nin lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps, gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a\nlot of scrambling through trees. It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look\nat the three that are attached to our outer ear.\nWe can’t get much movement out of these muscles, especially compared to some of our\nmammal relatives who use them to locate the sources of sounds.\nPresumably this would have been quite helpful for early nocturnal mammals.\nIn humans, you can still detect the remnants of this adaptation with electrodes.\nIn one study researchers recorded a spike of activity in the ear muscle cells in response\nto a sudden sound. Not enough to move the ear, but detectable.\nAnd you can probably guess the location of the sound based on the results - it came from\na speaker to the left of the study subjects. So this is their left ear subconsciously trying\n(and failing) to pivot toward the sound. You can see another futile effort by our vestigial\nbody parts when you get goosebumps. When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to\nour body hairs contract, pulling the hair upright which causes the surrounding skin\nto form a bump. For our furry mammal relatives, the raised\nhair increases the amount of space for insulation, helping them stay warm.\nBirds can do this too. you’ve probably seen a puffy pigeon on a cold day.\nAdrenaline is one of the hormones involved in the body’s response to cold temperatures,\nand it’s also part of the fight or flight response.\nSo it helps some animals appear larger when they’re threatened.\nAnd it may be why surprising and emotional turns in music can give some people goosebumps.\nAnd then there’s our tail. At the end of our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some\npeople have 3, some have 5. We call it the tailbone.\nIt now serves as an anchor for some pelvic muscles but it’s also what’s left of our\nancestors’ tails. Every one of us actually had a tail at one\npoint. When the basic body plan is being laid out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans\nembryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates.\nAnd that includes a tail with 10-12 developing vertebrae.\nIn many other animals it continues to develop into a proper tail.\nBut in humans and other apes, the cells in the tail are programmed to die a few weeks\nafter they appear. Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the\nancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until\nthey’re about 6 months old have this incredible grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s\na similar reflex for their feet. I wanted to show you this great piece of footage from\nthe 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior.

{"page": 40, "lesson": 6, "title": "The Philosophy of The Buddha", "category": "Philosophy & Religion", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/TD8y3Rwg", "transcript": {"en": "The story of the Buddha’s life, like all\nof Buddhism, is a story about confronting suffering. He was born between the sixth and fourth century\nB.C., the son of a wealthy king in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. It was prophesied that the young Buddha — then\ncalled Siddhartha Gautama — would either become the emperor of India or a very holy\nman. Since Siddhartha’s father desperately wanted\nhim to become the former, he kept the child isolated in a palace. Young Gautama had every imaginable luxury:\njewels, servants, lotus ponds, even beautiful dancing women. For 29 years, Gautama lived in bliss, protected\nfrom the smallest misfortunes of the outside world But then, he left the palace for short excursions. What he saw amazed him: first he met a sick\nman, then an aging man, and then a dying man. show these kind of people in India—add them\nto the same image one by one He was astounded to discover that these unfortunate\npeople represented normal—indeed, inevitable—parts of the human condition that would one day\ntouch him, too. Horrified and fascinated, Gautama made a fourth\ntrip outside the palace walls—and encountered a holy man, who had learned to seek spiritual\nlife in the midst of the vastness of human suffering. Inspired by the holy man, Gautama left the\npalace for good. He tried to learn from other holy men. He almost starved himself to death by avoiding\nall physical comforts and pleasures, as they did. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it did not bring him\nsolace from suffering. Then he thought of a moment when he was a\nsmall boy: sitting by the river, he’d noticed that when the grass was cut, the insects and their eggs were trampled and destroyed. As a child, he’d felt a deep compassion for\nthe tiny insects. Reflecting on his childhood compassion, Gautama felt a profound sense of peace. He\nate, meditated, and finally reached the highest state of enlightenment: Nirvana It refers to the “blowing out” of the\nflames of desire. With this, Gautama had become the Buddha,\n“the awakened one”. The Buddha awoke by recognising that all of\ncreation, from distraught ants to dying human beings, is unified by suffering. Recognising this, the Buddha discovered how\nto best approach suffering. First, one shouldn’t bathe in luxury, nor abstain from food and comforts altogether. Instead, one ought to live in moderation . The Buddha called this the middle way This allows for maximal concentration on cultivating\ncompassion for others and seeking enlightenment Next, the Buddha\ndescribed a path to transcending suffering called The four noble\ntruths The first noble truth is the realisation that\nfirst prompted the Buddha’s journey: that there is suffering and constant dissatisfaction\nin the world. The second is that this suffering is caused\nby our desires. As the Buddha said, “attachment is the root of all suffering.” The third truth is that we can transcend suffering\nby removing or managing these desires. The Buddha thus made the remarkable claim that we must change our outlook, not our circumstances. We are unhappy not because we don’t have\nenough money, love or status but because we are greedy, vain, and insecure. By re-orienting\nour mind we can grow to be content. The people become happier—superimpose smiles\nor use a second image of their face With the correct behaviour and what we now\nterm a mindful attitude, we can also become better people. We can invert negative emotions\nand states of mind, turning ignorance into wisdom, anger into compassion, and greed into\ngenerosity. The fourth and final noble truth the Buddha\nuncovered is that we can learn to move beyond suffering through what he termed the noble\neightfold path. The eightfold path involves a series of aspects\nof behaving “right” and wisely: right view, right intention, right speech, right\naction, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. What strikes the western observer is the notion\nthat wisdom is a habit, not merely an intellectual realisation. One must exercise one’s nobler\nimpulses on a regular basis, as one would train a limb. The moment of understanding\nis only one part of becoming a better person. After his death, The Buddha’s followers\ncollected his “sutras” (sermons or sayings) into scripture, and developed texts to guide\nfollowers in meditation, ethics, and mindful living. The monasteries that had developed during\nthe Buddha’s lifetime grew and multiplied, throughout China and East Asia. For a time, Buddhism was particularly uncommon\nin India itself, and only a few quiet groups of yellow-clad monks and nuns roamed the countryside,\nmeditating quietly in nature. But then, in the 3rd century B.C., an Indian\nking named Ashoka grew troubled by the wars he had fought and converted to Buddhism. He sent monks and nuns far and wide to spread the practice. Buddhist spiritual tradition spread across\nAsia and eventually throughout the world. Buddha’s followers divided into two main\nschools: Theravada Buddhism which colonised Southeast Asia, and Mahayana Buddhism which took hold in China and Northeast Asia. Today, there are between a half and one and\na half billion Buddhists in both East and West following the Buddha’s teachings and\nseeking a more enlightened and compassionate state of mind. Intriguingly, the Buddha’s teachings are\nimportant regardless of our spiritual identification.

Suddenly, the text below was transformed. The words magically became clear. But it wasn't until a millennium later\nthat that same principle would be used to create \nthe earliest glasses. Today, glasses can help millions of people\nwith poor vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The key to understanding what that means\nlies with the term refraction, the ability of a transparent medium,\nlike glass, water, or the eye to change the direction\nof light passing through it. The eye has two main refractive surfaces: the cornea and the lens. Ideally, these surfaces work together to refract light in a way that accurately\nfocuses light onto the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue\nat the back of the eye that works with the brain\nto give rise to vision. But many people develop refractive errors, either during childhood \nas their eyes are growing, or in later life as their eyes age. Imperfections in the cornea and lens cause refracted light to be focused\nin front of or behind the retina, making images appear blurry. People with refractive errors\ncan still see color, movement, and light, but the details of what they're looking at\nare out of focus. People experience refractive \nerrors in different ways, owing to differences in their eyes. In some, light refracts too much, and in others, too little. Eyes with a focal point \nin front of the retina are called myopic, or short-sighted. They can see close objects clearly, but those far away are out of focus. But when the focus point \nis behind the retina, people are hyperopic,\nor long-sighted. For them, objects close up\nare unfocused, but distant objects are crystal clear. Finally, some people have a cornea\nwith a non-spherical shape that causes astigmatism, a form of out-of-focus vision\nthat makes all objects seem blurred, whether close or far. As we age, our eyes face new challenges. When we're young, the lens of the eye\nis flexible and can change shape to bring\nimages into focus, something called accommodation. This keeps objects in focus when we\nshift our gaze from far to near. But as we get older, the lens becomes\nless flexible, and can't change shape when we want\nto look at near objects. This is called presbyopia, and it affects adults starting\naround the age of 40 years. Myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Each of these is a refractive error. Nowadays we can fix them all with glasses\nor contact lenses, which work by refocusing light\nso it strikes the retina precisely. It's even possible to correct vision\nwith surgery using lasers that change the shape\nof the cornea and alter its refractive properties. But glasses remain the most popular. By using carefully crafted lenses to steer light to exactly \nthe right spot on the retina, a person's clear vision can be restored. We've come a long way \nsince Seneca's discovery and the crude glasses of yesteryear. In 1727, a British optician named\nEdward Scarlett developed the modern style of glasses which are kept in place with arms\nwhich hook over each ear. Today's glasses take their inspiration\nfrom that design, but they're also much more precise\nand personal. Each pair is tailored for an individual\nto bring out their unique powers of sight. So if you're one of the 500 million people\nwith a problem with close or far vision, or both, there's a pair of glasses out there\nwaiting to reveal a whole new world that's hiding in plain view."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is NOT a solution for correcting refractive errors?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "contact lenses"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eye exercises"}, {"label": "C", "text": "glasses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "laser ey"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which part of the eye refracts light?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eyelash"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eyelid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cornea"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Retina"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Approximately how many people in the world are living with uncorrected refractive errors?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5,000,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100,000,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "500,000,000"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "At what age do people typically start to need reading glasses (presbyopia)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "8 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "21 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "40 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "70 years"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a solution for correcting refractive errors?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Contact lenses"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eye exercises"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Glasses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Laser eye surgery"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which condition can be described as over-refracting light so that the focal point is in front of the retina?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Myopia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hyperopia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Astigmatism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Presbyopia"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Jacobs", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-schools-of-fish-swim-in-harmony-nathan-s-jacobs", "transcript": {"en": "How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain\ngive rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have\nthe same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of\nsophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, \nfish stick together in groups, but that's not just because\nthey enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit \ncomplex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out\nas easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader\nis the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly\ntwisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks \nlike deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually\njust following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close\nto your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on\nthe minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group,\nsomething remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish \nis eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own\nunique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled\nby any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish\nfollowing the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over\nand over again, allowing fish all across the ocean\nto reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many\ncomplex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which\nmillions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same\nbasic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes\nin the atmosphere, the specific binding properties\nof water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices\nthat form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it\nby simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step\nto understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish\nto individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain \nto individual neurons, you're left with something that is\nnotoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about\nright now isn't reliant on a single neuron\nlodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from\nthe collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons \nin the human brain, and trillions of connections between\nall those neurons. When you turn such a complicated\nsystem like that on, it could behave in all sorts\nof weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow\nsimple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity\nself-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things \nlike recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task\nover and over again, and keep all those silly little habits\nthat everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules \nwhen it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron\nin the brain is to either excite or inhibit\nother neurons. If you connect a few neurons together\ninto a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns\nof activity, feedback loops that ramp up\nor shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons\ncan actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns \nof activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting\nin so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity\ncannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits\ndescribed earlier. And yet, from this chaos,\npatterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again\nin a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent\npatterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying\ntheir own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena\nat vastly different scales is that same remarkable\ncharacteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require\nsomeone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into\nthe same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium\nthat lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons\nthat produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and\neconomies of our cities across the planet."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What about a school of fish does emergence describe?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The type of fish in the school"}, {"label": "B", "text": "What food the fish eat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Which muscles that control swimming behavior"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How the combined movements of all the fish produce group behavior"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What two simple rules do individual fish follow that allows them aggregate into schools (pick two of the below)?

He wanted to leave \nall of his money to you, but he knew that if he did,\nyour relatives would pester you forever. So he is banking on the fact that he taught you everything \nyou need to know about riddles. Your uncle left the following \nnote in his will: \"I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it together,\nyou will share the money evenly. However, if you are the first to find\nthe pattern and solve the problem without going through all of the leg work, you will get the entire inheritance \nall to yourself. Good luck.\" The lawyer takes you and your 99 relatives\nto a secret room in the mansion that contains 100 lockers, each hiding a single word. He explains: Every relative is assigned a number\nfrom 1 to 100. Heir 1 will open every locker. Heir 2 will then \nclose every second locker. Heir 3 will change the status\nof every third locker, specifically if it's open, \nshe'll close it, but if it's closed, she'll open it. This pattern will continue until\nall 100 of you have gone. The words in the lockers that remain\nopen at the end will help you crack the code for the safe. Before cousin Thaddeus can even start\ndown the line, you step forward and tell the lawyer\nyou know which lockers will remain open. But how? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is realizing that the number\nof times a locker is touched is the same as the number of factors\nin the locker number. For example, in locker #6, Person 1 will open it, Person 2 will close it, Person 3 will open it, and Person 6 will close it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 \nare the factors of 6. So when a locker has an even number\nof factors it will remain closed, and when it has an odd number of factors, it will remain open. Most of the lockers \nhave an even number of factors, which makes sense because factors\nnaturally pair up. In fact, the only lockers that have\nan odd number of factors are perfect squares because those have one factor that when\nmultiplied by itself equals the number. For Locker 9, 1 will open it, 3 will close, and 9 will open it. 3 x 3 = 9, but the 3 can only be counted once. Therefore, every locker that is \na perfect square will remain open. You know that these ten lockers \nare the solution, so you open them immediately\nand read the words inside: \"The code is the first five lockers\ntouched only twice.\" You realize that the only lockers \ntouched twice have to be prime numbers since each only has two factors: 1 and itself. So the code is 2-3-5-7-11. The lawyer brings you to the safe, and you claim your inheritance.

But look deep into the atomic structure\nof any of them, and you'll see a world in constant flux. Stretching, contracting, springing, jittering, drifting atoms everywhere. And though that movement may seem chaotic,\nit's not random. Atoms that are bonded together, and that describes almost all substances, move according to a set of principles. For example, take molecules,\natoms held together by covalent bonds. There are three basic ways \nmolecules can move: rotation, translation, and vibration. Rotation and translation \nmove a molecule in space while its atoms stay \nthe same distance apart. Vibration, on the other hand, \nchanges those distances, actually altering the molecule's shape. For any molecule, you can count up\nthe number of different ways it can move. That corresponds to \nits degrees of freedom, which in the context of mechanics basically means the number of variables\nwe need to take into account to understand the full system. Three-dimensional space is defined by\nx, y, and z axes. Translation allows the molecule to move\nin the direction of any of them. That's three degrees of freedom. It can also rotate around \nany of these three axes. That's three more, unless it's a linear molecule, \nlike carbon dioxide. There, one of the rotations just spins\nthe molecule around its own axis, which doesn't count because it doesn't\nchange the position of the atoms. Vibration is where it gets a bit tricky. Let's take a simple molecule,\nlike hydrogen. The length of the bond that holds the two\natoms together is constantly changing as if the atoms were connected \nby a spring. That change in distance is tiny,\nless than a billionth of a meter. The more atoms and bonds a molecule has,\nthe more vibrational modes. For example, a water molecule \nhas three atoms: one oxygen and two hydrogens,\nand two bonds. That gives it three modes of vibration: symmetric stretching, asymmetric stretching, and bending. More complicated molecules have even\nfancier vibrational modes, like rocking, wagging, and twisting. If you know how many atoms a molecule has,\nyou can count its vibrational modes. Start with the total degrees of freedom, which is three times the number\nof atoms in the molecule. That's because each atom can move\nin three different directions. Three of the total correspond \nto translation when all the atoms \nare going in the same direction. And three, or two for linear molecules,\ncorrespond to rotations. All the rest, 3N-6\nor 3N-5 for linear molecules, are vibrations. So what's causing all this motion? Molecules move because they absorb\nenergy from their surroundings, mainly in the form of heat\nor electromagnetic radiation. When this energy gets transferred\nto the molecules, they vibrate, rotate, or translate faster. Faster motion increases the kinetic energy\nof the molecules and atoms. We define this as an increase \nin temperature and thermal energy. This is the phenomenon your microwave oven\nuses to heat your food. The oven emits microwave radiation,\nwhich is absorbed by the molecules, especially those of water. They move around faster and faster, bumping into each other and increasing\nthe food's temperature and thermal energy. The greenhouse effect is another example. Some of the solar radiation \nthat hits the Earth's surface is reflected back to the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, like water vapor\nand carbon dioxide absorb this radiation and speed up. These hotter, faster-moving molecules\nemit infrared radiation in all directions, including back to Earth, warming it. Does all this molecular motion ever stop? You might think that would happen\nat absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature. No one's ever managed to cool\nanything down that much, but even if we could, molecules would still move due to\na quantum mechanical principle called zero-point energy. In other words, everything has been moving\nsince the universe's very first moments, and will keep going long, \nlong after we're gone."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many rotational ‘degrees of freedom’ does a non-linear molecule have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "3N"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3N-5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3N-6"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The movement of any given molecule around its axes is known as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vibration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rotation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Translation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Infatuation"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Carbon dioxide has ____ rotational and ____ translational modes of motion.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4; 3"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3; 2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2; 3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3; 3"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A large protein consisting of 94 atoms has ____ vibrational ‘degrees of freedom.’", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "277"}, {"label": "B", "text": "276"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "282"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When molecules move faster their thermal energy ______ and their temperature _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increases; Decreases"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decreases; Decreases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Decreases; Increases"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increases; Increases"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Perfection and extreme motivation in his prce practice often wasn't seen by his fans in order to perform his mind-blowing stuns Houdini had to train intensely both physically and mentally he trained himself to be ambidextrous making his left hand as able as his right he was said to practice untying knots with his toes so much so that his toes had the dexterity of his fingers he would swallow large objects and regurgitate them back up again he practiced slight of hand and misdirection in front of a large mirror for hours and hours at a time and his practice sessions were so constant that he would frequently forget to eat change and even bathe of course all this dedication consumed most of his time meaning there was hardly time to sleep 4 hours a night was said to be a lion for Houdini but if in his short hours of sleep he did awake with an idea for a new stun or trick there was always a notebook by his bedside in order for him to write it down he even had a large sunken bathtub installed in his house where he could practice his breath holds and would fill it with ice in order to prepare his body for his handcuffed free ing River plunges he built himself into the man he wanted to become and you can't help but respect every ounce of that his bizarre interest in the maab he would study murder cases and used to enjoy performing to inmates on death row he even bought a

I've attended I have never seen or heard anything that could convince me that there is a possibility of communications with the loved ones who have gone beyond despite saying this Houdini still believed in the afterlife he just wasn't convinced that communication was possible Houdini's imaginary son now it's unsure why Houdini and his wife of 32 years Bess didn't have children some say Bess was unable to carry and others say that Houdini was x-rayed many times by his brother who was remarkably New York's first x-ray specialist and the constant exposure to radiation made Houdini sterile but just because they couldn't have a child it didn't mean they couldn't invent one yep they invented a son and he was called mayor Samuel Houdini named after Harry's father while Harry was away he would write letters to Bess asking how his son was getting on and what he'd been up to Bess would let Harry know that mayor was doing well the final letters written about their son was that he was doing well and had now become the president of the United States now lots of people say that they were both just nuts but I see it as a cute way to bring each other closer together and help brighten the fact that he couldn't have children Houdini was killed by one of his own fans Harry died of peritonitis secondary to a ruptured appendix on October the 31st Halloween in 1926 he was aged just 52 his insurance company concluded that the death was due to him being punched in the stomach by a university student called Jay Gordon Whitehead Whitehead was witnessed delivering several heavy blows to Houdini's stomach before he had the chance to prepare after the incident Houdini continued performing his upcoming show in a great deal of pain the pain lasted for 2 days and when he finally visited a doctor he was told he had a fever and acute appendicitis he was advised to have immediate surgery but Houdini being so dedicated to his craft ignored the advice and decided to go on with another show when Houdini arrived at the Garrick theater in Detroit Michigan on October the 24th 1926 for what would be his last performance he had a fever of 104 and must have felt awful but despite this he took to the stage he was reported to have passed out during the show but was revived and continued to perform afterwards he was hospitalized at Detroit's Grace Hospital where he died shortly after his last words were said to be I am weaker I guess I have lost the fight the Houdini paranormal ritual despite Houdini not seeing any firsthand proof of communication with the afterlife he certainly believed in life after death and always told his wife B that if he died he would attempt to communicate with her if he was able to do so he gave her a secret code that if she heard being whispered one day or if a spiritualist said the secret code was coming through during a seance Bess would know it was her husband every Halloween Bess would haul a seance in an attempt to contact him but after 10 years with no success she gave up incredibly though the Seance still continues to this day every year on October the 31st a group of spiritualists hold a ritual in an attempt to communicate with Houdini

It's one of the toughest sequences\nin ballet, and for those thirty seconds or so, she's like a human top \nin perpetual motion. Those spectacular turns\nare called fouettés, which means \"whipped\" in French, describing the dancer's incredible\nability to whip around without stopping. But while we're marveling at the fouetté,\ncan we unravel its physics? The dancer starts the fouetté by pushing\noff with her foot to generate torque. But the hard part \nis maintaining the rotation. As she turns, friction between her pointe shoe \nand the floor, and somewhat between her body and the air, reduces her momentum. So how does she keep turning? Between each turn, the dancer pauses\nfor a split second and faces the audience. Her supporting foot flattens, and then twists as it rises \nback onto pointe, pushing against the floor to generate\na tiny amount of new torque. At the same time, her arms sweep open\nto help her keep her balance. The turns are most effective if her center\nof gravity stays constant, and a skilled dancer will be able to keep\nher turning axis vertical. The extended arms \nand torque-generating foot both help drive the fouetté. But the real secret and the reason\nyou hardly notice the pause is that her other leg never stops moving. During her momentary pause, the dancer's elevated leg straightens\nand moves from the front to the side, before it folds back into her knee. By staying in motion, that leg is storing\nsome of the momentum of the turn. When the leg comes back in \ntowards the body, that stored momentum gets transferred\nback to the dancer's body, propelling her around as she rises\nback onto pointe. As the ballerina extends and retracts\nher leg with each turn, momentum travels back and forth\nbetween leg and body, keeping her in motion. A really good ballerina can get more\nthan one turn out of every leg extension in one of two ways. First, she can extend her leg sooner. The longer the leg is extended,\nthe more momentum it stores, and the more momentum it can return\nto the body when it's pulled back in. More angular momentum means\nshe can make more turns before needing to replenish\nwhat was lost to friction. The other option is for the dancer to bring her arms \nor leg in closer to her body once she returns to pointe. Why does this work? Like every other turn in ballet, the fouetté is governed \nby angular momentum, which is equal to the dancer's angular\nvelocity times her rotational inertia. And except for what's lost to friction, that angular momentum has to stay\nconstant while the dancer is on pointe. That's called conservation\nof angular momentum. Now, rotational inertia can be thought of as a body's resistance \nto rotational motion. It increases when more mass is distributed\nfurther from the axis of rotation, and decreases when the mass is distributed\ncloser to the axis of rotation. So as she brings her arms closer\nto her body, her rotational inertia shrinks. In order to conserve angular momentum, her angular velocity,\nthe speed of her turn, has to increase, allowing the same amount \nof stored momentum to carry her through multiple turns. You've probably seen ice skaters\ndo the same thing, spinning faster and faster\nby drawing in their arms and legs. In Tchaikovsky's ballet, the Black Swan\nis a sorceress, and her 32 captivating fouettés do seem\nalmost supernatural. But it's not magic that \nmakes them possible. It's physics."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is a fouetté?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Turn"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Slice"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whip"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Strike"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A fouetté turn usually begins with a preceding turn in order to generate a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lowering of the center of gravity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Torque needed for rotational momentum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Horizontal force"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vertical force"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "___ between the pointe shoe (or foot) and the floor reduces momentum.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Friction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vertical force"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Horizontal force"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When the dancer brings the arms and leg in to the body (mass) during the turn, the result is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The turn slows down"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The turn speeds up"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The turn stops"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Fouettés are governed by the conservation of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Horizontal force"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Angular (rotational) momentum"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Friction"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

However, there's an early 20th century\ngreat French poet whose name you may not know: Guillaume Apollinaire. He was a close friend and collaborator\nof artists like Picasso, Rousseau, and Chagall. He coined the term surrealism, and he was even suspected of stealing\nthe Mona Lisa in 1911. During his short lifetime, he created poetry that combined\ntext and image in a way that seemingly predicted\nan artistic revolution to come. In the late 19th \nand early 20th century Paris, the low-rent districts of Montmartre\nand Montparnasse were home to every \nkind of starving artist. It was all they could afford. These painters, writers, \nand intellectuals, united in their artistic passion\nand counterculture beliefs, made up France's bohemian subculture. And their works of art, literature,\nand intellect would shake up the world. At the turn of the 20th century, within this dynamic scene, art critic, poet, \nand champion of the avant-garde, Guillaume Apollinaire \nwas a well-known fixture. As an art critic, Apollinaire explained the cubist \nand surrealist movements to the world, and rose to the defense \nof many young artists in the face of what was often\na xenophobic and narrow-minded public. As a poet, Apollinaire was passionate\nabout all forms of art and a connoisseur of medieval literature, especially calligraphy \nand illuminated initials. As a visionary, Apollinaire saw a gap\nbetween two artistic institutions. On one side was the popular, highly \nlauded traditional art forms of the time. On the other, the forms \nof artistic expression made possible through surrealism, cubism, and new inventions, \nlike the cinema and the phonograph. Within that divide, through the creation of his most important\ncontribution to poetry, the calligram, Guillaume Apollinaire built a bridge. Apollinaire created the calligram\nas a poem picture, a written portrait, a thoughts drawing, and he used it to express his modernism and his desire to push poetry beyond\nthe normal bounds of text and verse and into the 20th century. Some of his calligrams are funny, like the \"Lettre-Océan.\" Some of them are dedicated\nto his young dead friends, like \"La Colombe Poignardée \net le jet d'eau.\" Some of them are the expression\nof an emotional moment, as is \"Il Pleut\": \"It's raining women's voices\nas if they had died even in memory, and it's raining you as well,\nMarvellous encounters of my life, o little drops. Those rearing clouds begin to neigh\na whole universe of auricular cities. Listen if it rains while regret\nand disdain weep to an ancient music. Listen to the bonds fall off\nwhich hold you above and below.\" Each calligram is intended\nto allow readers to unchain themselves from the regular experience of poetry, and feel and see something new. \"Lettre-Océan\" is first an image to be seen\nbefore even the words are read. Text-only elements combine with words\nin shapes and forms. Two circular forms, \none locked in a square, the other, morph beyond\nthe page in the shape of a spiral. Together they create a picture\nthat hints towards cubism. Then on closer reading of the text, the descriptive words within suggest the image of an aerial view \nof the Eiffel Tower. They give tribute to electromagnetic waves\nof the telegraph, a new form of communication at the time. Undoubtedly, the deeply layered artistic \nexpressions in Apollinaire's calligrams are not just a brilliant display\nof poetic prowess from a master of the form. Each calligram itself is also\na snapshot in time, encapsulating the passion, the excitement, and the anticipation of all the \nbohemian artists of Paris, including Apollinaire, most of whom are well ahead of their time, and with their innovative work, eagerly grasping for the future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Guillaume Apollinaire was both a poet and a(n):", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Novelist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Journalist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Art critic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Painter"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Guillaume Apollinaire was close to a young painter by the name of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dali"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Toulouse-Lautrec"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Magritte"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Picasso"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Guillaume Apollinaire wanted to push the “quest of another reality.” This is not defined by science and reason, so he created a new word:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hyperrealism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Surrealism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Expressionism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fantasy"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A calligram can be defined as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A text written in a decorative hand; for example, calligraphy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A text with short sentences, as in a telegram"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A text in which the poet has the liberty to set his words and letters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A text in which the poetry forms pictures by means of the placement of letters and words on the page"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

These two materials are essential to so\nmuch of our infrastructure and technology, and they have a complementary set\nof strengths and weaknesses. Steel is strong and hard, but difficult to shape intricately. While plastic can take on \njust about any form, it's weak and soft. So wouldn't it be nice if there\nwere one material as strong as the strongest steel and as shapeable as plastic? Well, a lot of scientists \nand technologists are getting excited about a relatively\nrecent invention called metallic glass with both of those properties, and more. Metallic glasses look shiny and opaque,\nlike metals, and also like metals,\nthey conduct heat and electricity. But they're way stronger than most metals, which means they can withstand\na lot of force without getting bent or dented, making ultrasharp scalpels, and ultrastrong electronics cases, hinges, screws; the list goes on. Metallic glasses also \nhave an incredible ability to store and release elastic energy, which makes them perfect \nfor sports equipment, like tennis racquets, golf clubs, and skis. They're resistant to corrosion, and can be cast into complex shapes\nwith mirror-like surfaces in a single molding step. Despite their strength \nat room temperature, if you go up a few hundred \ndegrees Celsius, they soften significantly, and can be deformed into\nany shape you like. Cool them back down, and they regain the strength. So where do all of these wondrous\nattributes come from? In essence, they have to do with\nmetallic glass' unique atomic structure. Most metals are crystalline as solids. That means that if you zoomed in\nclose enough to see the individual atoms, they'd be neatly lined up\nin an orderly, repeating pattern that extends throughout \nthe whole material. Ice is crystalline, and so are diamonds, and salt. If you heat these materials up enough\nand melt them, the atoms can jiggle freely\nand move randomly, but when you cool them back down, the atoms reorganize themselves, reestablishing the crystal. But what if you could cool \na molten metal so fast that the atoms couldn't \nfind their places again, so that the material was solid, but with the chaotic, amorphous internal\nstructure of a liquid? That's metallic glass. This structure has the added benefit\nof lacking the grain boundaries that most metals have. Those are weak spots where the material\nis more susceptible to scratches or corrosion. The first metallic glass was made\nin 1960 from gold and silicon. It wasn't easy to make. Because metal atoms \ncrystallize so rapidly, scientists had to cool the alloy down\nincredibly fast, a million degrees Kelvin per second, by shooting tiny droplets\nat cold copper plates, or spinning ultrathin ribbons. At that time, metallic glasses could\nonly be tens or hundreds of microns thick, which was too thin \nfor most practical applications. But since then, \nscientists have figured out that if you blend several metals\nthat mix with each other freely, but can't easily crystallize together, usually because they have very different\natomic sizes, the mixture crystallizes much more slowly. That means you don't have to cool\nit down as fast, so the material can be thicker, centimeters instead of micrometers. These materials are called bulk\nmetallic glasses, or BMGs. Now there are hundreds of different BMGs, so why aren't all of our bridges\nand cars made out of them? Many of the BMGs currently available\nare made from expensive metals, like palladium and zirconium, and they have to be really pure because any impurities \ncan cause crystallization. So a BMG skyscraper or space shuttle\nwould be astronomically expensive. And despite their strength, they're not yet tough enough\nfor load-bearing applications. When the stresses get high,\nthey can fracture without warning, which isn't ideal for, say, a bridge. But when engineers figure out\nhow to make BMGs from cheaper metals, and how to make them even tougher, for these super materials, the sky's the limit."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the key structural difference between metallic glasses and metals in general?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Most metals are crystalline whereas metallic glasses have disordered atomic structure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Metals are good conductors of heat and electricity whereas metallic glasses are not"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Metallic glasses are resistant to chemical corrosion whereas metals are not"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Metals shrink during solidification while metallic glasses don’t"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How can you make metals or mixtures of metals glassy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By coating metals with glass"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By melting the metal(s) and cooling the liquid down fast enough to prevent crystallization"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By welding metals together"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How did materials scientists manage to produce bulk metallic glasses?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By carefully choosing alloying metals that are happier together than separate (i.e., have negative heats of mixing)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By carefully choosing alloying metals with very different atomic sizes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both a) and b)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are some of the impressive properties of bulk metallic glasses?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are significantly stronger and springier than most metals at room temperature"}, {"label": "B", "text": "At higher temperatures, they soften a lot and can easily be shaped into intricate shapes in solid state"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Solidification shrinkage is negligible, so they can be cast into precise shapes in a single molding step"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lack of ‘grain boundaries’ makes them resistant to chemical corrosion"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What is currently preventing metallic glasses from being used extensively in load bearing applications?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Expensive raw materials and relatively high cost of production"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lack of adequate toughness; failure without warning"}, {"label": "C", "text": "None of the above"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both a) and b)"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What advantage does a BMG golf club head have over its traditional counterpart?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A metallic glass club head could add distance to your swings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Metallic glass club heads are shinier"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Metallic glass club heads are stronger"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 40, "lesson": 16, "title": "Is radiation dangerous? - Matt Anticole", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-radiation-dangerous-matt-anticole", "transcript": {"en": "When we hear the word radiation, it's tempting to picture huge explosions\nand frightening mutations, but that's not the full story. Radiation also applies to rainbows and a doctor examining an x-ray. So what is radiation really, and how much should we worry\nabout its effects? The answer begins with understanding\nthat the word radiation describes two very different \nscientific phenomena: electromagnetic radiation and nuclear radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is pure energy consisting of interacting electrical\nand magnetic waves oscillating through space. As these waves oscillate faster, they scale up in energy. At the lower end of the spectrum,\nthere's radio, infrared, and visible light. At the higher end are ultraviolet, X-ray, and gamma rays. Modern society is shaped by sending\nand detecting electromagnetic radiation. We might download an email to our phone\nvia radio waves to open an image of an X-ray print, which we can see because our screen\nemits visible light. Nuclear radiation, on the other hand, originates in the atomic nucleus, where protons repel each other\ndue to their mutually positive charges. A phenomenon known as\nthe strong nuclear force struggles to overcome this repulsion and keep the nucleus intact. However, some combinations\nof protons and neutrons, known as isotopes, remain unstable, or radioactive. They will randomly eject matter\nand/or energy, known as nuclear radiation, to achieve greater stability. Nuclear radiation comes from natural\nsources, like radon, a gas which seeps up from the ground. We also refine naturally occurring\nradioactive ores to fuel nuclear power plants. Even bananas contain trace amounts\nof a radioactive potassium isotope. So if we live in a world of radiation, how can we escape its dangerous effects? To start, not all radiation is hazardous. Radiation becomes risky when it rips\natoms' electrons away upon impact, a process that can damage DNA. This is known as ionizing radiation because an atom that has lost\nor gained electrons is called an ion. All nuclear radiation is ionizing, while only the highest energy \nelectromagnetic radiation is. That includes gamma rays, X-rays, and the high-energy end of ultraviolet. That's why as an extra precaution\nduring X-rays, doctors shield body parts \nthey don't need to examine, and why beach-goers use sunscreen. In comparison, cell phones and microwaves\noperate at the lower end of the spectrum, so there is no risk of ionizing radiation\nfrom their use. The biggest health risk occurs\nwhen lots of ionizing radiation hits us in a short time period, also known as an acute exposure. Acute exposures overwhelm the body's\nnatural ability to repair the damage. This can trigger cancers, cellular dysfunction, and potentially even death. Fortunately, acute exposures are rare, but we are exposed daily to lower levels\nof ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources. Scientists have a harder time quantifying\nthese risks. Your body often repairs damage\nfrom small amounts ionizing radiation, and if it can't, the results of damage may not manifest\nfor a decade or more. One way scientists compare ionizing\nradiation exposure is a unit called the sievert. An acute exposure to one sievert\nwill probably cause nausea within hours, and four sieverts could be fatal. However, our normal daily exposures\nare far lower. The average person receives \n6.2 millisieverts of radiation from all sources annually, around a third due to radon. At only five microsieverts each, you'd need to get more \nthan 1200 dental X-rays to rack up your annual dosage. And remember that banana? If you could absorb \nall the banana's radiation, you'd need around 170 a day\nto hit your annual dosage. We live in a world of radiation. However, much of that radiation\nis non-ionizing. For the remainder that is ionizing, our exposures are usually low, and choices like getting your home\ntested for radon and wearing sunscreen can help reduce \nthe associated health risks.

chief in ireland and served him for six years it was during his captivity that he became a christian one day he heard what he described as a voice compelling him in his sleep to leave his master and find a ship that awaited him he fled to the coast of ireland and eventually made it back to his home he then decided to study in the monastery and stayed there for 12 years during which he decided that his calling was to convert the pagans to christianity eventually he adopted his christian name patricius or patrick as we now know it and returned to ireland after being appointed a bishop patrick was very successful at winning converse which upsetted the celtic druids who had him arrested several times but he managed to escape each arrest patrick traveled through ireland establishing

being vanquished by his former slave there are a lot of legends surrounding saint patrick some say that he raised people from the dead others say that he drove snakes out of ireland but since there aren't any fossil records of snakes in ireland at that time it's highly unlikely unless he drove out the fossils as well many think that snakes was a metaphor for the conversion of the pagans meaning that he drove paganism out from ireland green wasn't the original color associated with st patrick it was first blue it eventually changed for various reasons probably because of being used in various irish flags and how green is associated with ireland itself patrick worked in ireland for 30 years afterwards he retired and then died on march 17th in ad-461 there wasn't a canonization process when patrick died that didn't come up until the 12th century he would have been declared his same by acclamation and his sainthood approved by a local bishop soon after he died st patrick's day was originally a catholic holiday and still is but has also evolved into a secular holiday being celebrated by non-irish non-catholics and ironically enough even atheists today when people think of st patrick they imagine a leprechaun in a green jacket hat pipe clover and a pot of gold not a man who devoted 30 years of his life to teaching and helping the irish hopefully you now know a little more

It's called \"Las Meninas,\"\nor \"The Maids of Honor,\" painted by Diego Velázquez in 1656, and it depicts a scene in the life\nof the Spanish Royal Court. A well-dressed child princess refuses\na glass of water from a handmaid, while a dwarf teases a dog. A second dwarf stands next to them, while the artist himself \npauses at his canvas. Two more people whisper in the background, while a third appears \nto be exiting the room, and why wouldn't he when there seems\nto be so little going on? Even the dog looks bored. But look more closely. The two people reflected\nin the blurry mirror at the back, easily missed at first glance, are none other than\nKing Philip IV and Queen Mariana, seemingly changing the scene from a simple\ndepiction of court life to that of a royal portrait. And with this piece of information, we can begin to understand far more\nabout the painting and why it has captivated viewers\nfor centuries. First, there's the historical context. When \"Las Meninas\" was painted\nat the end of Philip's reign, the Spanish Empire \nwas in a period of decline, having suffered defeat in\nThe Thirty Years War, as well as economic \nand political difficulties. The King himself had also \nsuffered misfortune, losing both his first wife and his only \nheir to the throne before remarrying. But the painting obscures their struggle\nto provide food for their household. Even the monarch's advanced \nage is concealed through the blurring of the mirror. What we do see in the geometric center\nof the canvas, brightly illuminated by the light\nfrom the window, in the Infanta Margarita Teresa, the King's only living legitimate child\nat the time. Her glowing and healthy appearance is an idealized view of the struggling\nempire's future. However, the Infanta is not the only\ncenter of the painting. Through the clever use of perspective, as well as painting the work life-sized,\non a 10.5 x 9 foot canvas, Velázquez blurs the boundary\nbetween art and reality, creating the sense of a three-dimensional\npicture that we can walk into. The line between the ceiling and the wall\nconverges to the open door, further creating the perception\nof the painting as a physical space seen from the viewer's perspective. In this sense, the audience\nand the real world are the focus, underlined by the three figures\nlooking straight at the viewer. But there is still another focal point. The line formed by the light fixtures\nleads to the center of the back wall to the mirror reflecting the royal couple. And its positioning relative to the viewer has led to radically different \ninterpretations of the entire work. The mirror could be reflecting the King\nand Queen posing for their portrait, or is it reflecting the canvas? And what do we make of the fact that Velázquez never painted\nthe royal portrait implied here? Could the painting actually be\ndepicting its own creation instead? With the incorporation of the mirror\ninto his work, Velázquez elevated the art of painting from its perception as a simple craft to an intellectual endeavor. With its three competing center points, \"Las Meninas\" captures the contrast \nbetween the ideal, the real, and the reflected worlds, maintaining an unresolved tension\nbetween them to tell a more complex story than any mirror can provide."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who painted \"Las Meninas\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Velazquez"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Picasso"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ferdinand II"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Philip IV"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Whose reflection is rendered in the mirror?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The artist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "King and Queen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prince and Princess"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bridesmaid"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In which war did Spain suffer defeat around the time of this painting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30 Years War"}, {"label": "B", "text": "7 Years War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "War of the Roses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100 Years War"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which character is describe as an “idealized view of the struggling empire's future?”", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The artist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "King and Queen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The dog"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Infanta"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which character is describe as an “idealized view of the struggling empire's future?”", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The artist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "King and Queen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The dog"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Infanta"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who stands at the vanishing point of this painting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "King and Queen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The artist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The man at the door"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Infanta"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 40, "lesson": 19, "title": "A shark-deterrent wetsuit (and it's not what you think)", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/kqXKPm5e", "transcript": {"en": "Scientific breakthrough, the kind that can potentially save lives, can sometimes be lying right out in the open for us to discover, in the evolved, accumulated body of human anecdote, for example, or in the time-tested adaptations that we observe in the natural world around us. Science starts with observation, but the trick is to identify the patterns and signatures that we might otherwise dismiss as myth or coincidence, isolate them, and test them with scientific rigor. And when we do, the results will often surprise. Western Australia has had a particular problem with shark attacks over the last three years, unfortunately and tragically culminating in five fatal shark attacks in a 10-month period during that time. But Western Australia is not alone in this. The incident of shark engagements on humans is escalating worldwide. And so it's not surprising, perhaps, that in July of this year, Shark Attack Mitigation Systems in collaboration with the University of Western\nAustralia Oceans Institute made an announcement which captured the attention of the worldwide media and of ocean users worldwide, and that was around the development of technology to mitigate or reduce the risk of shark attack based on the science of what sharks can see. And I have for you today the story of that journey, but also the notion that science can be as powerful as a translator as it can be for invention. When we began this process, we were looking, it was about three years ago, and we'd just had the first two fatal shark attacks in Western Australia, and by chance, in a previous role, I happened to be having dinner with Harry Butler. Now Harry Butler, who most Australians\nwould know is a famous naturalist, had spent a lot of time in the marine environment. Harry Butler is a precursor, if you like, to the late Steve Irwin. When I asked him about what the solution to the problem might be, the answer was quite surprising. He said, \"Take a black wetsuit, band it in yellow stripes like a bumblebee, and you'll be mimicking the warning systems of most marine species.\" I didn't think about that much at the time, and it wasn't until the next three\nfatal shark attacks happened, and it caused me to think, maybe there's some merit to this idea. And I turned to the web to see if there might be some clues. And it turns out the web is awash with this sort of evidence that supports this sort of thinking. So biologically, there are plenty of species that display banding or patterns, warning patterns, to either be cryptical in the water or warn against being attacked, not the least of which is the pilot fish which spends a big slab of its life around the business end of a shark. On the human side, Walter Starck, an oceanographer, has been painting his wetsuit since the 1970s, and anthropologically, Pacific island tribes painted themselves in bands in a sea snake ceremony to ward off the shark god. So what's going on here? Is this an idea lying wide out in the open for us to consider and define? We know that sharks use a range of sensors when they engage, particularly for attack, but the sight sensor is the one that they use to identify the target, and particularly in the last number of meters before the attack. It makes sense to pay attention\nto the biological anecdote because that's time-tested evolution over many millennia. But isn't human anecdote also an evolution of sorts, the idea that there's a kernel of truth thought to be important, passed down from generation to generation, so that it actually ends up shaping human behavior? I wanted to test this idea. I wanted to put some science to this anecdotal evidence, because if science could support this concept, then we might have at least part of the solution to shark attack right under our very nose. To do that, I needed some experts in shark vision and shark neurology, and a worldwide search, again, led to the University of W.A. on the doorstep here, with the Oceans Institute. And professor Nathan Hart and his team had just written a paper which tells us, confirms that predatory sharks see in black and white, or grayscale. So I called up Nathan, a little bit sheepishly, actually, about this idea that maybe we could use these patterns and shapes to produce a wetsuit to try and\nmitigate the risk of shark attack, and fortunately, he thought that was a good idea. So what ensued is a collaborative bit of research supported by the West Australian State Government. And we did three key things. The first is that we mapped the characteristics, the physical characteristics of the eyes of the three main predatory sharks, so the great white, tiger and bull shark. We did that genetically and we did that anatomically. The next thing we did was to understand, using complex computer modeling, what that eye can see at different depths, distances, light conditions, and water clarity in the ocean. And from there, we were able to pinpoint two key characteristics: what patterns and shapes would present the wearer as hidden or hard to make out in the water, cryptic, and what patterns and shapes might provide the greatest contrast but provide the greatest breakup of profile so that that person wasn't confused for shark prey or shark food. The next thing we needed to do was to convert this into wetsuits that people might actually wear, and to that end, I invited Ray Smith, a surfer, industrial designer, wetsuit designer, and in fact the guy that designed\nthe original Quiksilver logo, to come over and sit with the science team and interpret that science into aesthetic wetsuits that\npeople might actually wear. And here's an example of one of the first drawings. So this is what I call a \"don't eat me\" wetsuit. So this takes that banding idea, takes that banding idea, it's highly visible, provides a highly disruptive profile, and is intended to prevent the shark from considering that you would be ordinary food, and potentially even create confusion for the shark. And this one's configured to go with a surfboard. You can see that dark, opaque panel on the front, and it's particularly better for the surface, where being backlit and providing a silhouette is problematic. Second iteration is the cryptic wetsuit, or the one which attempts to hide the wearer in the water column. There are three panels on this suit, and in any given conditions, one or more of those panels will match the reflective spectra of the water so as to disappear fully or partially, leaving the last panel or panels to create a disruptive profile in the water column. And this one's particularly well-suited to the dive configuration, so when you're deeper under the water. So we knew that we had some really solid science here. We knew, if you wanted to stand out, you needed to look stripy, and we knew if you wanted to be cryptic, you needed to look like this. But the acid test is always going to be, how would sharks really behave in the context of these patterns and shapes. And testing to simulate a person in a wetsuit in the water with a predatory shark in a natural environment is actually a lot harder than you might think. (Laughter) So we have to bait the rig, because we need to get the statistical number of samples through to get the scientific evidence, and by baiting the rig, we're obviously changing shark behavior. We can't put humans in the water. We're ethically precluded from even using humanoid shapes and baiting them up in the water. But nevertheless, we started the testing process in January of this year, initially with tiger sharks and subsequently with great white sharks. The way we did that was to get a perforated drum which is full of bait, wrap it in a neoprene skin, and then run two stereo underwater cameras to watch how the shark\nactually engages with that rig. And because we use stereo, we can capture all the statistics\non how big the shark is, what angle it comes in at, how quickly it leaves, and what its behavior is in an empirical rather than a subjective way. Because we needed to\npreserve the scientific method, we ran a control rig which was a black neoprene rig just like a normal black wetsuit against the, what we call, SAMS technology rig. And the results were not just exciting, but very encouraging, and today I would like to just give you a snapshot of two of those engagements. So here we've got a four-meter tiger shark engaging the black control rig, which it had encountered about a minute and a half before. Now that exact same shark had engaged, or encountered this SAMS rig, which is the Elude SAMS rig, about eight minutes before, and spent six minutes circling it, hunting for it, looking for what it could\nsmell and sense but not see, and this was the final engagement. Great white sharks are more\nconfident than the tigers, and here you see great white shark engaging a control rig, so a black neoprene wetsuit, and going straight to the bottom, coming up and engaging. In contrast to the SAMS technology rig, this is the banded one, where it's more tactile, it's more investigative, it's more apprehensive, and shows a reluctance to come straight in and go. (Applause) So, it's important for us that all \nthe testing is done independently, and the University of W.A. is doing the testing. It'll be an ongoing process. It's subject to peer review and subject to publication. It's so important that this concept is led with the science. From the perspective of Shark \nAttack Mitigation Systems, we're a biotechnology licensing company, so we don't make wetsuits ourselves. We'll license others to do that. But I thought you might be interested in seeing what SAMS technology looks like embedded in a wetsuit, and to that end, for the first time, live, worldwide -- (Laughter) — I can show you what biological adaptation, science and design looks like in real life. So I can welcome Sam, the surfer, from this side. Where are you, Sam? (Applause) And Eduardo. (Applause) Cheers, mate. Cheers. Thanks, gentlemen. (Applause) So what have we done here? Well, to my mind, rather than take a blank sheet and use science as a tool for invention, we've paid attention to the biological evidence, we've put importance to the human anecdotal evidence, and we've used science as a tool for translation, translation of something that was already there into something that we can \nuse for the benefit of mankind. And it strikes me that this idea of science as a tool for translation rather than invention is one that we can apply much more widely than this in the pursuit of innovation. After all, did the Wright brothers discover manned flight, or did they observe the biological fact of flight and translate that mechanically, replicate it in a way that humans could use? As for the humble wetsuit, who knows what oceanwear will look like in two years' time, in five years' time or in 50 years' time, but with this new thinking, I'm guessing there's a fair chance it won't be pure black. Thank you.

For centuries, such rituals\nwere commonplace for European nobility. And while they've gone out of fashion, we recognize the components\nunder a familiar label: ballet. Ballet, from Italian \"balletto,\"\nor little dance, originated in Renaissance Italy\nas a combination of social dance and choreographed display\nat aristocratic gatherings. In many aspects, it was a way\nof controlling people in court with acceptable forms of behavior, such as the manner in which people\nstepped, bowed, or took someone's hand. It also involved rules governing\neverything from attire to where one could walk or sit\nin relation to the King. Over time, the study of ballet became\na central element of court life, and proper grasp of the etiquette could\nmake or break one's success as a courtier. Many of these court gestures can still\nbe seen in modern ballet techniques. Ballet was brought to France\nin the 16th century by Catherine de' Medici, the Italian wife of King Henry II. As celebrations became more lavish,\nso did the dance, with dancing masters teaching\nelaborate steps to young nobles and story elements providing\na unifying theme. The focus shifted from participation\nto performance, and the form acquired \nmore theatrical trappings, such as professionally designed sets and a slightly raised platform or stage\nwith curtains and wings. But it was in the 17th century court\nof Louis XIV that ballet was refined into the art\nwe know today. Louis himself had been trained\nin ballet from childhood. His early role as the sun god\nApollo at age fifteen cemented the central role ballet\nwould play during his reign. It also earned him the title\nof Sun King, with his splendid golden costume\nand choreography that promoted the idea of the king\nas a divinely ordained ruler. Louis would go on to perform\n80 roles in 40 major ballets, either as a majestic lead, or sometimes playing minor \nor comedic parts before emerging in the lead role\nas the end. He trained daily in ballet, as well as fencing and riding, and through his example, dancing became an essential skill\nfor all gentlemen of the era. But Louis XIV's main contribution \nto ballet was not as a performer. His founding of \nthe Royal Academy of Dance in 1661 shifted control of ballet\nfrom local guilds to the royal court. As director, he appointed his personal ballet master \nand frequent performance partner Pierre Beauchamp, who codified the five main positions \nof the body still used today. Through is collaborations\nwith Jean-Baptiste Lully, the director of the Royal Music Academy, and famed playwright Molière, Beauchamp helped establish ballet\nas a grand spectacle. And in 1669, a separate ballet academy\nwas founded. The Paris Opera Ballet survives today\nas the oldest ballet company in the world. Ballet moved away from the royal court\nto the theater and survived the democratic revolutions\nand reforms that followed over the next century. With the advent of the romantic movement, fantasy and folklore themes \nbecame common motifs. And though the influence of ballet\nin France would decline, other countries, such as Russia, would play a major role \nin its further development. Fortunately, today most of us don't\nhave to learn a complicated set of steps just to socialize at a wedding. Instead, we can go to the theater\nto see professionals who spend their lives training rigorously to perform feats that would have been\nunimagineable in Louis XIV's day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Ballet was brought to France in what century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "14th"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15th"}, {"label": "C", "text": "16th"}, {"label": "D", "text": "17th"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Louis XIV’s main contribution to ballet was as (a):", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Scenic designer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Performer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ballet master"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Founder of the Royal Academy of Dance"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In addition to Ballet, Louix XIV also studied:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Folk dancing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fencing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Acting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Horseback riding"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both B and D"}, {"label": "F", "text": "Both A and C"}, {"label": "G", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "At the time of Louis XIV, knowing ballet was a key component element of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Behavior and etiquette"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fitness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Peasant life"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "King Louis XIV was best known for his role as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Zeus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Apollo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Poseidon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dionysus"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

To save your life, you need the antidote\nexcreted by a certain species of frog. Unfortunately, only the female \nof the species produces the antidote, and to make matters worse, the male and female occur in equal\nnumbers and look identical, with no way for you to tell them apart, except that the male \nhas a distinctive croak. And it may just be your lucky day. To your left, you've spotted a frog\non a tree stump, but before you start running to it, you're startled by the croak\nof a male frog coming from a clearing \nin the opposite direction. There, you see two frogs, but you can't tell which one \nmade the sound. You feel yourself starting \nto lose consciousness, and realize you only have time to go\nin one direction before you collapse. What are your chances of survival\nif you head for the clearing and lick both of the frogs there? What about if you go to the tree stump? Which way should you go? Press pause now\nto calculate odds yourself. 3 2 1 If you chose to go to the clearing,\nyou're right, but the hard part is correctly \ncalculating your odds. There are two common incorrect ways\nof solving this problem. Wrong answer number one: Assuming there's a roughly equal\nnumber of males and females, the probability of any one frog being\neither sex is one in two, which is 0.5, or 50%. And since all frogs are independent\nof each other, the chance of any one of them being female\nshould still be 50% each time you choose. This logic actually is correct \nfor the tree stump, but not for the clearing. Wrong answer two: First, you saw two frogs in the clearing. Now you've learned that at least\none of them is male, but what are the chances that both are? If the probability of each individual frog\nbeing male is 0.5, then multiplying the two together\nwill give you 0.25, which is one in four, or 25%. So, you have a 75% chance \nof getting at least one female and receiving the antidote. So here's the right answer. Going for the clearing gives you\na two in three chance of survival, or about 67%. If you're wondering how this \ncould possibly be right, it's because of something called\nconditional probability. Let's see how it unfolds. When we first see the two frogs, there are several possible combinations\nof male and female. If we write out the full list, we have what mathematicians call\nthe sample space, and as we can see, out of the four possible combinations,\nonly one has two males. So why was the answer of 75% wrong? Because the croak gives \nus additional information. As soon as we know \nthat one of the frogs is male, that tells us there can't be \na pair of females, which means we can eliminate\nthat possibility from the sample space, leaving us with \nthree possible combinations. Of them, one still has two males, giving us our two in three,\nor 67% chance of getting a female. This is how conditional probability works. You start off with a large sample space\nthat includes every possibility. But every additional piece of information\nallows you to eliminate possibilities, shrinking the sample space and increasing the probability \nof getting a particular combination. The point is that information\naffects probability. And conditional probability isn't just\nthe stuff of abstract mathematical games. It pops up in the real world, as well. Computers and other devices use\nconditional probability to detect likely errors in the strings\nof 1's and 0's that all our data consists of. And in many of our own life decisions, we use information gained from \npast experience and our surroundings to narrow down our choices\nto the best options so that maybe next time, we can avoid eating that poisonous \nmushroom in the first place."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "You spot a random frog.
