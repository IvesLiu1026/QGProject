we squeezed a the spear of the nation called us Caesar was formed after Sharpeville when 67 people were killed men women and children and over 180 were wounded during a peaceful demonstration it is at that time that Mandela realized and it was a very difficult decision for him that nonviolent resistance was not enough since he was wanted by the government he traveled abroad secretly gaining support for the cause when he returned to South Africa he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison while in prison he was also charged with sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government Mandela stood trial but refused to defend himself because this would legitimize the state's case Mandela received a life sentence to be served in the prison on Robben Island a desolate Rock Island seven miles off the coast of Cape Town instead of being forgotten in jail Mandela became a symbol for the movement to end apartheid during the 1980s several offers of release were made to Mandela on the condition that he renounce violence he refused in February of 1990 the government declared the ANC legal and announced Mandela was to be released here's this man who hasn't been seen for over a quarter century walking out into the world now free at the age of 71 Mandela was named the head of the ANC his work to help bring an end to apartheid earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 in 1994 for the first time in more than 300 years blacks in South Africa would have the opportunity to vote for their rulers at the age of 75 Mandela was elected president in a landslide becoming the president I think he really really moved the world because this was a place that most of us didn't think would ever see black leadership and so for him to rise to power after being in jail for 27 years I think it was just a really historical moment Mandela proved to be a master politician knowing when to be unyielding and when to compromise unfortunately his marriage to Winnie came to an end in 1996 in 1998 Mandela married his third wife on his 80th birthday the following year he stepped down as president of the ANC Nelson used his stature to help mediate the civil war in Burundi he continues to work with human rights organizations and for AIDS awareness and I think that he will be known as you know one of the peaceful freedom fighters of our time Nelson Mandela continues to be a defining symbol of how one man can truly make a difference in the world"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "During college, Nelson Mandela ran away to Johannesburg to try to avoid:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A pre-arranged marriage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A civil war uprising"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A village famine"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was Nelson Mandela charged with when he was arrested in 1956?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Treason"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Murder"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Libel"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How old was Nelson Mandela when he was eventually released?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "58"}, {"label": "B", "text": "65"}, {"label": "C", "text": "71"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "During college, Nelson Mandela ran away to Johannesburg to try to avoid:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A pre-arranged marriage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A civil war uprising"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A famine"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was Nelson Mandela charged with when he was arrested in 1956?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Treason"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Aggravated Assault"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Libel"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How old was Nelson Mandela when he was eventually released from prison?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "58"}, {"label": "B", "text": "65"}, {"label": "C", "text": "71"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

been around Sydney and I've asked people what causes the phases of the moon and you know what they say how do we get the faces of the Moon uh because of the the Earth blocks the the light that comes from the Sun a full moon is basically where we're seeing the full uh circle of the Moon reflected back to Earth but the light is actually coming from the Sun and the Cresent with the crants are caused by the Shadows of the Earth from the Sun onto the moon the phases of the moon is that about the Sun and the Moon and the and the something goes in front of something the Earth between this moon and the sun we won't see the moon and then it as it goes around the earth gets out of the way so More Of The Sun Shines on the moon and we can see the moon I think so let's try to resolve it what really causes the phases of the moon phases of the moon um for we need to know a couple of things first one is there's only one source of light in the solar system and that's the Sun so at the center of the solar system it produces all the light so both the Earth and the moon are half illuminated by that one source of light as the moon moves around the earth our perspective on it changes because sometimes we see just the unlet face of the moon when the moon is between us and the sun that's a new moon other times we'll see the moon has moved around the earth and we see the moon half illuminated and half dark we'd call that first quar water at other times still when the moon is moved further around the earth we see the full illuminated face of the Moon and we call that full moon but it's just because the Moon is half illuminated by the Sun and it's our perspective on that half illuminated Moon which gives the phases why doesn't the Earth block the light when we're seeing a full moon you know if it's Sun Earth Moon why doesn't the Earth block out the light so we can't see the moon you would think that would happen every full moon you would think the Earth the moon would go through the Earth's Shadow at every full moon but in fact the moon's orbit is tilted slightly to the orbit of the Earth around the Sun how much is it tilted by about 5° so virtually every Full Moon the Moon is moving just above or just below the Earth's Shadow I'm here with Andrew Jacobs at the cydney observatory and we've just witnessed a total lunar eclipse so can you tell me what that is so total lunar eclipse is when normally there would be a full moon but the full moon happens when the moon is in Earth's Shadow so the Moon is passed through Earth's shadow um it's gone through the outer fainter part of the Shadow gone into the inner darker part and turned red so why does it look red when it's in the middle of Earth Shadow ah there three three effects here going on one is that the Earth's atmosphere is refracting the light into towards the moon bit like a prism is it bit like a prism yes exactly like that um it the blue light however is being scattered out by the Earth's atmosphere just like a sunset you see a red sunset because the blue light is scattered outwards um so that leaves the red light preferentially to get through to the moon and then if there's dust perhaps volcanic dust in the Earth's atmosphere that dims the light so um leads to either a brighter or darker red color on the face of the moon what can we use the lunar eclipse 4 why is it important to us a few years ago I would have said it was had no importance at all not much importance anyway beautiful thing to look at but not much scientific importance but nowadays um we know that there are planets orbiting around other stars alien ex exoplanets we call them and if we can measure um the light that's going through Earth's atmosphere and reflecting off the Moon it can give us an idea of what we might expect to see if the light is coming through the atmosphere of an exoplanet orbiting around another star so we can use the observations of a lunar eclipse around the earth to infer what's what the atmosphere of a exoplanet may be like we can detect things like ozone or carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere by looking at the Spectrum that reflects off the moon and if we see a similar Spectrum when we look at a exoplanet around another star we could infer there is um ozone or carbon dioxide in that atmosphere could you detect water vapor as well you could detect water vapor as well yes and that would obviously be a pretty exciting sign if we saw that that would be a very exciting sign yes yes all those things together and perhaps a methane as well might suggest that

{"page": 3, "lesson": 4, "title": "How well do masks work?", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/GsuClwql", "transcript": {"en": "[coughing sounds]\nThis is how COVID-19 is spread. Through air currents, potentially carrying\nmicroscopic droplets full of coronavirus. When we talk. Breathe. Or cough. We can see this thanks to an imaging technique\nthat lets us peer into the invisible world of airflow. And using this same technique, we can see\nif masks really do help to stop the spread of coronavirus [MUSIC] Hey smart people, Joe here. If you’ve been feeling confused about masks,\nwhat they do, what they don’t do, and whether or not you should wear one – I hope this\nvideo will help. And since I’m all by myself at the moment,\nI don’t need to wear this. Or this. This is Matthew Staymates, a fluid dynamicist\nand mechanical engineer at the National Institute of Standards and Technology. And while stuck at home he turned his garage\ninto a lab. Using a technique called schlieren imaging\nhe captured some incredible images of a world invisible to our eyes. If you’ve ever seen wavering distortions\nabove a hot road, that fluttery mirage happens because different temperatures and densities\nof air bend light in different ways, like a fluid lens. And when we talk, warm air streams out of\nour mouths meeting the sea of colder air around us. A schlieren setup lets us see these tiny differences. A narrow source of light is bounced off a\nconcave mirror towards a camera, with a thin metal blade blocking some of the focused light. As that light interacts with air in the space\nbetween, it’s bent in ever-so-slightly different ways, creating shadows and bright spots in\nthe final image. As you can see in this Veritasium video from\nmy friend Derek, it lets us see everything from shockwaves to heat rising off a candle. And at 250 frames per second, it shows us\nexactly why masks work to slow airborne infection. Now, it’s important to remember that we\ncan’t see viral particles in these images. They are too small. But the viruses are carried on that breath\njust like a river carries fish. In fact, an individual viral particle is smaller\nthan the weave of most fabrics. So why does this work? Well, masks help in two interesting ways. First, it’s important to understand that\nviruses don’t float around alone. They fly out in droplets of moisture. Most droplets are heavy enough that they fall\nwithin 2 meters or so, but any person or object within that distance can get bathed in virus. And without a mask, some of those droplets\ncan evaporate into super tiny particles of infection that can float on air currents far\nfrom your mouth or nose, and these microdroplets are extremely hard for any mask to filter\nout. But with a mask on, in the warm, humid space\nbetween your mouth and the mask, those larger droplets don’t have time to evaporate, and\nthey can be captured by common fabrics. If it feels hot and humid in here, that means\nit’s working. And the second way masks work, is that any\ndroplets that do get through now have less momentum. The air currents disperse in eddies and swirls\ninstead of flowing away in streams, which means droplets won’t travel as far. So, which mask is the best mask? If it seems like recommendations change all\nthe time, that’s because doctors and scientists know more now than they did months ago. And they will know more months from now, than\nthey do today. Which is exactly how science is supposed to\nwork. What we do know is whether you’re using\na bandana, an N95 mask, or a cloth mask you sewed at home, they all still have a lot of\ndroplet-blocking power. But that mask has to fit. This is almost like not wearing a mask at\nall. A mask that’s too tight, or has too many\nthick layers can actually force more air out the sides. A good test is to see if you can blow a candle\nout through your mask from about 1 foot away. [blowing] These schlieren images are clear evidence\nthat masks are effective. But the best science relies on multiple lines\nof evidence. Here's an experiment that we did with a person\ntalking through a sheet of laser light, illuminating all of the microdroplets released as we speak. With a mask, those droplets are all caught. And this microbiologist sneezed, sang, talked,\nand coughed over petri dishes. A simple mask blocked nearly all of the germs,\nand even though this experiment detected bacteria and not viruses, they both leave our airway\nin the same respiratory droplets. It should be pretty clear to you now why masks\nwork, and the body of research that proves that is getting stronger all the time. Links down in the description! But really, the most important question is\nwhy should you wear a mask? You know, it’s often said that masks aren’t\nto keep you from getting sick, but to keep you from getting others sick. Wearing a mask can dramatically reduce the\nchance of spreading COVID. But that’s a strange thing to think about,\nbecause you might think “Well, I’m not sick, I’ve got a strong immune system…\nso I don’t need to wear this.” But we know that COVID-19 can go undetected,\nand almost half of infections may come from people who don’t show symptoms. That could be you. Or it could be the person next to you. And if it is, wouldn’t you want them wearing\na mask? They probably feel the same way about you. Can masks harm your health, like lowering\nyour body’s oxygen levels? No, that’s a myth, and it’s been tested\nover and over again by healthcare workers who work all day in masks. And masks won't stop the pandemic on their\nown. They’re best used in combination with other\nsafety measures, like handwashing and physical distancing. Stereotypically \"macho\" people have actually\nbeen shown to resist masks more. I get it: Dudes, you don’t feel cool, even\nthough lots of cool dudes wear masks. Or maybe your nose itches, and your glasses\nfog up, your face is sweaty. No fun. I get it. For most people wearing masks is new, and\nweird, and different. But there are lots of things that used to\nbe weird and different, until everyone just started doing them. I mean umbrellas used to be viewed as completely\nfeminine accessories for rich people, and only to shade the sun. Until one day some masculine men decided they\nwere tired of getting rained on and suddenly enough people were using umbrellas that they\nbecame like the most boring, socially acceptable thing ever. It's true, look it up. Most people didn’t use condoms in sexual\nrelationships until the risks of HIV and other infections pushed people to change their behavior,\nand now it’s not only normal, it’s a way to say I respect you, and I want to protect\nboth of us. This is also a sign you want to protect others\nand have them protect you. And the sooner that this becomes part of everyone’s\nnormal, everyday life, the sooner we can all get back to normal, everyday life. In every pandemic in history, it’s the actions\nand choices of individual people that have made the difference. A mask can stop a virus, but it also sends\na message: We’re all in this together. And that’s something we all need to hear\nright now and every day. Stay curious. Thanks for watching this video and I hope\nthat you'll send it to somebody that you know that needs to hear this message. But remember, what we know from social psychology\nis that shaming people into wearing masks, that's not going to work. SO come at it with an open mind and an open\nheart, and we can all do this together. And like always, I'd like to thank everyone\nwho supports the show on Patreon.

If that sounds familiar, maybe you might consider\nyourself a visual learner. Or, if reading or listening does the trick,\nmaybe you feel like you’re a verbal learner. We call these labels learning styles, but\nis there /really/ a way to categorize different types of students? Well, it actually seems like /multiple/ presentation\nformats, especially if one of them is visual, help most people learn. When psychologists and educators test for\nlearning styles, they’re trying to figure out whether these are inherent traits that\naffect how well students learn, instead of just a preference. Usually, they start by giving a survey to\nfigure out what style a student favors, like visual or verbal learning. Then, they try to teach the students something\nwith a specific presentation style, like using visual aids, and do a follow-up test to see\nhow much they learned. That way, the researchers can see if the self-identified\nverbal learners really learned better when the information was just spoken aloud, for\nexample. But, according to a 2008 review, only /one/\nstudy that followed this design found that students actually learned best with their\npreferred style… And it had some pretty big flaws. The researchers excluded two-thirds of the\noriginal participants because they didn't seem to have /any/ clear learning style from\nthe survey at the beginning. Plus, they removed outliers from the data\nif they thought they were “extreme,” without defining exactly what that meant. And, they didn't even report the actual test\nscores in the final paper. So ... it doesn’t really seem like learning\nstyles are an inherent trait that we all have. But, that doesn't mean that all students will\ndo amazingly if they just spend all their time reading from a textbook. Instead, /most people/ seem to learn better\nif they’re taught in several ways – especially if one is visual. In one study, researchers tested whether students\nremembered lists of words better if they heard them, saw them, or both. And everyone seemed to do better if they got\nto see the words in print, even the self-identified auditory learners. That preference didn't seem to matter. Similar studies tested whether students learned\nbasic physics and chemistry concepts better by reading plain text or viewing pictures,\ntoo. And everyone did better with the help of pictures. So the question of whether or not you're a\nvisual learner could best be answered with: \"Well, yeah, kinda. But so are most people.\" Thanks for asking, and thanks especially to\nall of our patrons on Patreon who keep these answers coming.

But is binge watching bad for your brain and body? In the past, it may have actually been deadly. In 1967, an error in manufacturing led to the selling of TVs which emitted harmful X-Rays with radiation levels 100,000 times higher than what is considered safe today. But even modern televisions cause a strain on your eyes. Under normal circumstances, humans blink around 18 times per minute, but when staring at a screen, this rate decreases drastically causing sore and tired eyes. Fortunately, these symptoms are generally short-term. In children, however, simply spending extended hours indoors can have developmental effects. A condition called Myopia, where the eyes cannot focus properly, is seen much more frequently in children who spend more time inside. Not only are you constantly forced to focus on nearby objects as opposed to far off landscapes and distances, but scientists believe that the sun itself may actually play a role in healthy eye regulation. And while TV may feel like a nice way to relax your body and brain, that may not always be a good thing. Not only is a sedentary lifestyle a major contributor to obesity, but studies have shown that people who watch less TV tend to burn more calories, even if they aren't doing more physical activity. Simply doing more mentally rigorous tasks like reading, playing a board game, or simple household activities, requires more energy and burns more calories. And if you want to truly relax, TV before bed may also be hurting you. Studies have shown that it may actually reduce the hours of quality sleep, contributing to chronic sleep debt. It may also affect other bedtime activities. Researchers have found that those who watch more than 20 hours of TV a week have, on average, a 44% reduction in sperm. But perhaps the most significant findings relate directly to your life span. Not only is there a documented correlation between TV viewing time and risk for diabetes and heart disease, but as shocking as it may be, multiple studies have found a correlation between TV viewing time and ALL causes of death. One study concluded that every hour spent in front of the TV may cut as much as 22 minutes off your life. Of course, correlation does not equal causation, and you can have a healthy relationship with TV if consumed in moderation like anything else. At the root of many of these claims is the physical inactivity associated with prolonged TV watching. Ultimately, the more you move, the more you live.

It’s a stunning view of a U-turn in the\nColorado River near the border of Arizona and Utah. In the early 90s, this spot was a hidden gem\n— accessible by an unmarked dirt trail off the side of the highway. Locals described it as “nearly empty”\n— and that “hardly anybody knew about it.” But over the years, its popularity grew: first\nslowly... … and then suddenly. Until it became this. In this past this used to be that this place would get maybe a few thousand visitors every single year. Now, that number is more like 1.5 million. And it keeps growing. That change didn’t happen because of any\nbig marketing push. It happened because of geotagged pictures\nlike these. Digital popularity is physically changing\nthe landscape. This place — and other public lands like\nit — are trying to adjust. Social media — I believe — was the\nmain trigger. That explosion — just — has been overwhelming. You can see that social media explosion when\nyou look at the rate of Google searches for Horseshoe Bend. But it isn't the only previously-hidden spot\nthat's become internet famous. Similar increases have happened at Devil’s\nBathtub, a swimming hole in Virginia... … Kanarraville Falls, a waterfall trail\nin Utah... … and Vance Creek Bridge, an old railroad\noverpass in Washington. So why are these places getting so much attention? For outdoor photographers searching for the\nperfect shot, Instagram made things easy: The app’s interface put geotagging — the\npractice of attaching location data to a picture — front and center. And if a hidden spot didn’t already have\na location tag available, anyone could create one. These Instagram hotspots were often located\neither just outside protected lands, or far off the beaten path. So as America’s National Parks became more\npopular than ever, these places started getting National\nPark-level crowds without having National Park-level infrastructure. Federally protected areas require a ton of\nplanning and work to keep people and the environment safe. There wasn't a developed trail here. There weren't any restroom facilities. There was no railing. It was an undeveloped site. Without that infrastructure, the natural landscape\ncan be damaged — and people following geotagging trends are at risk of injury or death. At Conundrum Hot Springs in Colorado, visitors\ndisturbed wildlife, cut down trees for firewood, and left behind an overwhelming amount of\nhuman waste. And at Kaaterskill Falls in New York, at least\nfour people have died while taking or posing for pictures. So at Horseshoe Bend, trail designers are\ngetting to work. The park service and the city of Page are\ncreating over 400 parking spaces, a welcome center, bathrooms, a viewing deck with safety\nrailings, and laser-equipped signs to count attendance. And they’re building a new ADA-compliant\ntrail, lined with limestone to protect the surrounding environment and reinforced with\nmagnesium chloride to keep gravel in place. Throughout the trail, all the improvements\nthat we're doing are aimed at creating as natural an environment as possible. It's a difficult balance. You're not going to stop people from going\nto the rim's edge and trying to capture that iconic photo. We don't want to wall it off. So all we can do is implore that people be safe. For places like Kanarraville Falls in Utah,\nthat concern for safety extends to their residents, too. The town’s water comes from a spring near\nthe falls, where’s it’s piped to tanks near the canyon entrance. It used to be a local secret — but in 2016,\n40,000 people hiked that trail, disturbing the water source and leaving debris behind. It shares so quick, and it gets out\nthere so fast, that people can look at it and say “Oh wow, look at that!” Then they tap on the photo, and it’ll tell\nwhere it was from or where it was taken. Things like that, and people go wild over it. You can imagine what that does to\nthe canyon floor, the trail, the water — people in and out. We've just tried to take adequate measures\nto try to work with the ecosystem, and not have it ruin our water source. Others are taking a different approach: there’s\nnow a growing movement in the nature photography scene against geotagging. So, in 1999 this organization called Leave\nNo Trace came up with a set of guidelines for people to use while they’re in the outdoors. These are things like don’t leave trash\nbehind, don’t interfere with wildlife, leave everything as it was when you saw it. And now in 2018 they’ve announced that they’re\nencouraging people not to geotag photos while they’re in nature. We’ve always had the tendency to explore\n— and sometimes be irresponsible in nature. Modern technology just amplifies those\nurges. With so many natural wonders at our fingertips\ntoday, it’s even more urgent that we treat them with respect and care — before it’s\ntoo late.

[♪ INTRO] Imagine: You’re having a good time \naround a fire when out of nowhere, the smoke blows straight into your face. Naturally, you just get up, \nyou move to get out of the way. You go back to having a good time again, and the smoke is suddenly \nblowing right back in your face! It was over there when I was over there! Now I’m over here, it’s over here! You and the people near you, you move out \nof the way, everything’s fine for a bit. Until, once again, your eyes start to sting. Eventually, everyone gets huddled in the one place that seems like it’s been smoke free. But you know what happens next. Your friends say that you are cursed because you brought the \nsmoke with you as you moved. There is no curse, which is honestly too bad. Because curses can be broken, \nbut laws of physics cannot. So all that smoke starts with fire. And fires release a lot of energy as heat, and air molecules nearby absorb some \nof that heat and start to move faster. Since temperature is just an \naverage measurement of how much energy molecules have, that means \nthe air starts heating up too. Those speedy molecules collide \nwith their slower neighbors and send those neighbors flying \noff in the opposite direction, freeing up space for the hot \nair near the fire to expand. This whole chain of events \nresults in the air near the fire becoming less dense than the air around it. Now, you may have heard that \nless-dense air rises, and that is true. It's usually better to live \non the top floor in the winter and in the basement in the summer. You also may have heard that less-dense air rises because it weighs less than the air it replaces, which is also true, but it's more \nof a definition than an explanation. It just means that less-dense air \nrises because it's less dense. The reason dense stuff sinks is because as you get farther above the ground, there \nis less and less air above you. So air down at the ground has \nto push with a lot of force to support the weight of all the air above it. And it's not just air! Everything down here at the ground pushes \nagainst the weight of the air above it. Now, if you were light enough that the \nforce of gravity on your body pulled you down less than that air pushed you up, \nyou would lift off like a hot air balloon. But you’re not: gravity pulls you \ndown more than the air pushes you up. So you sink. The hot air around a fire, on the other \nhand, is less dense than the air around it. Gravity pulls it down less than \nthe air around it pushes it up, and it rises into the sky. This is called convection. It happens \nin the Sun; it happens in the Earth; it happens in your oven, whether \nor not you have a convection oven. And, most importantly, it happens around a fire. And the real key to understanding why \nsmoke keeps blowing in your face is that the rising air doesn’t just rise on its own. It is pushed by the air around it. Because when hot air moves away from \nthe fire, the air that pushed it keeps right on going and fills the \ngap that the hot air left behind. And this is where you come in. You might think that you’re just sitting \nby the fire roasting some marshmallows. The fire is affecting you, but \nyou’re not affecting the fire. But you are. You form a wall that creates a kind of vacuum. If you were not there, air that \ncomes from where you’re sitting and air that comes from across the fire \nwould meet up at the fire and stop there. But you are there, so your body blocks the air behind you from moving toward the fire. So there’s nothing to stop the air coming \ntoward you from moving right on through the fire and into your face, bringing any \nsmoke or soot from the fire along with it. And since it’s you that’s blocking the air, \nyou block the air wherever you move to. Even more annoyingly, the \nvacuum is stronger when you have more people in one place because more \npeople block more of that airflow. So you’re better off on your own \nthan huddled with your friends if you want to avoid getting all \nthat smoke in your eyes and lungs. Or you could just get rid of \nthe smoke in the first place. Then, the vacuum would just \nsend warm air your way. And that’s the idea behind smokeless fire pits. Smoke is mostly compounds in \nwood that didn’t burn completely, either because the fire isn’t hot enough \nor because there isn’t enough oxygen. Smokeless fire pits solve the second \nproblem by creating additional paths for incoming air, reducing or even eliminating \nhow much smoke a fire produces. If that’s not an option, your next \nbest bet is to bring a protractor. And the more protractors, the better the party. That’s what I always say. Without any outside wind, having \neveryone spaced out equally means that the same amount of air \nis blocked from all directions, and nobody’s vacuum is \nstronger than anyone else’s. It’s really like a perfect \npandemic activity: you’re outside, you’re breathing into a fire \nplus, if you get too close to your friend, you get punished with \na bunch of smoke in your eyes.

{"page": 3, "lesson": 9, "title": "Does aloe vera really treat a sunburn?", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/68llseTM", "transcript": {"en": "[ INTRO ] It’s advice as old as time: if you get a\nsunburn, start lathering on the Aloe Vera. And when we say ‘old as time’, we mean\nit. Humans have been using aloe vera medicinally\nfor thousands of years. But does the slimy gel actually have skin-healing\nproperties? Well, the research is surprisingly scarce,\nbut it seems like it may help boost your skin’s natural healing process. Sunburns themselves really aren’t all that\ndifferent than burns from a campfire, a curling iron, or stepping on a George Foreman grill. So studies looking at burn healing tend to\nlump them together. And there is some evidence that applying the\nmucus innards from Aloe plants helps you heal faster after a burn. A review from 2007 in the journal Burns found\nthat in 127 burn victims, those who used aloe healed almost 9 days faster on average than\nthose in control groups. But what aloe actually does is a little less\nclear. In general, there are three main concerns\nwhen treating burns: reducing pain, actually healing the wound, and preventing infection. Aloe’s antibacterial and antifungal activities\nare well documented, so it might simply help because it keeps pesky microbes at bay. But ask just about anyone who slathers on\nthe aloe after a sunburn, and they’ll swear it’s an analgesic, meaning that it reduces\npain. And that might be because it reduces inflammation—your\nbody’s immune response that makes things like sunburns all red and painful. For example, an experiment in 1993 was able\nto isolate an enzyme in aloe that breaks down bradykinin, an inflammatory substance linked\nwith pain. But there’s not all that much clinical research\non aloe pain-killing effects, so the jury is still out on whether they’re real, or\nit’s just acting as a placebo. There’s a bit more evidence that it boosts\nskin healing. Studies in rats have shown that aloe extract\nhelps new skin cells move into burned areas, so they can rebuild the damaged tissue. And the gooey gel in aloe vera contains a\nlarge amount of glucomannan, a fiber comprised mostly of the sugar mannose, which stimulates\nthe production of fibroblastic growth factor. It helps stimulate the formation of collagen\nand new blood vessels, which speed up how quickly the skin heals. That said, human studies to date are kind\nof flimsy. A 2012 Cochrane review noted that the few\ntrials that have been conducted aren’t high quality—they’re all small, and their results\nare potentially biased by things the patients or caregivers knowing aloe was being used. So, it might work, or it might just be that\npeople think it’ll work. And when it comes to your over the counter\nsunburn gel, it might not even be the aloe itself. Researchers have found that it can speed up\nthat absorption of vitamins and drugs through the skin. So if your aloe gel also has things like Vitamin\nE, or some other anti-inflammatory drug, that substance gets into your skin faster. But whether aloe works or not, I think we\ncan all agree it’s just better to avoid needing it. So if you’re going to spend some time in\nthe sun this summer, maybe take steps to avoid overexposure instead of relying on aloe to\nsoothe your beet-red skin afterwards.

{"page": 3, "lesson": 10, "title": "The physics of a pool vortex", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/jgB2nT1w", "transcript": {"en": "[SQUEAKING] [POP] Check this out. I'm just gonna drag this plate\nthrough the water in the pool. That's it. But look what forms--\nperfect black circles on the bottom of the pool. And it's so weird. They don't die. They just keep going\nright next to each other. I sped this footage\nup because the circles took 3 minutes to cross\nthe pool and didn't seem to be dying out. These got sharper as they went\nand made it all the way across. So cool. And look closer. You can see what's causing them. There are two almost\nunnoticeable dips in the surface of the water. Why don't they die out? And how do these\ndark spots form? And why do the\ndips move together? So many questions. Let's first look\nat what they are. When I dragged the\nplate through the water, you could see it\nforming little vortices, like you get when you move\na paddle through the water. A vortex is a gas\nor a liquid moving in circles with what we\ncall a vortex line going up through the circles. They are everywhere--\ntornadoes, water flowing down the drain, hurricanes,\nor the movement of air over an airplane wing. Vortices often form when there's\na difference in fluid speed, like fast wind moving\nover slow wind. As you move the plate\nforward, the water right next to the boundary\nmoves with the plate because of friction. The water further\nout is not moving. It's that difference in velocity\nthat causes a shear force and starts the water spinning. This is accentuated by the water\nin front of the plate being forced around the\nsides and the water behind the plate\nbeing sucked forward as the plate moves along. In this coherent\nvortex, our dips can travel much further\nacross the pool than a ripple without dissipating. Why? The vortex wants to keep\nits angular momentum. So it continues spinning as\nit moves through the water and only loses some\nenergy through friction to the surrounding\nstationary water. So what we appear to\nhave here is two vortices moving across the pool. But it seems weird that\nthey stay right together. Well, when we\ncreate this vortex, we're forcing water to move\naround the whole plate, not just on the\nsurface of the water. Our vortex line is curved. We're creating a\nhalf vortex ring. You know, like a smoke ring,\nbubble ring, or even the plume rising up from an\nexplosion, but half of that. These two dips on\nthe water's surface are just the ends\nof the half ring. They're connected. And that's why\nthey stay together. We can see this if we put\na little food coloring into the ends. The food coloring travels\nfrom one end to the other. And you can see the\nentire half ring. So cool. We just made a bubble\nring without the bubble. This also tells you\nsomething interesting. The half ring is not a wave. A wave is a disturbance\nmoving through a medium that transfers energy but\ndoesn't transfer matter. When we added food\ncoloring, we saw clearly that the vortex is\ntransferring matter, just like a smoke ring does. So sadly, it's not a wave. It's cooler than a wave. Now back to this\nhalf-ring vortex. Isn't it weird? You've probably never seen\nhalf of a smoke ring before. Why? Well, according to\nHelmholtz's law, a vortex line cannot\nstart or end in a fluid. So a vortex line either\nwants to close into a loop or end at a boundary. If you tried to cut\na smoke ring in half, it would either break\nup or, even cooler, it would break up into\ntwo smaller smoke rings. I don't know if that happens. It would be awesome. Since the line can't end in the\nfluid, it ends at the surface. You almost never see\nthese half vortices though because\nthey have to occur on the boundary of two media. If you can think of another\nway to make the entire half ring visible, like a smoke ring\nor a bubble ring, let me know. So now, why does our vortex\ncreate those cool dark spots? Well, the balance between\ngravity, centripetal forces, and surface tension\ncreates a funnel shape which acts like a lens. Lenses often work by\nfocusing light to a point, like this Fresnel lens, which\ncan melt pennies in the sun. But I digress. Our vortex lenses focus the\nsunlight away from the center, like so. And you have a bright ring\nsurrounding a dark circle. The ring highlights the\ndark circle further. And you get these incredibly\nclear black spots. So cool. Now I highly recommend\ntrying this at home, especially if it's too\ncold to swim in the pool. Here are some tips. The water has to be very still. Even a small breeze makes\nit harder to create these. The sun has to be\nout, or it won't work. And you can try some\nother really cool things. Send your vortices at a wall. You'll see the dark\nspots spread out. Or try colliding two of them. Happy physics-ing.

{"page": 3, "lesson": 11, "title": "The fascinating physics of boat wakes", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/kEQUGWqB", "transcript": {"en": "If you look at the wake behind a duck, or\na kayak, or a ship, you might notice two unusual things: first, the wake isn’t simple (like\nthe perfectly straight shock wake of a supersonic projectile is) - it’s a fascinating, feathery,\nripple-y pattern. And second, that feathery pattern looks the\nsame - same angle, same repeating pattern of ripples along the edge, same reverse arcs\nin the middle - it looks more or less the same regardless of whether it’s made by\na duck, a kayak or a ship, even though they’re all moving at different speeds and the waves\nare very different sizes. The reason water wakes always have this particular\nshape and pattern is because of the surprising physics of water waves. While there's a single speed of light waves,\nand a single speed of sound waves, there's no single speed of water waves. In water, longer waves travel faster, while\nshorter waves travel slower. This phenomenon where different wavelength\nwaves travel at different speeds is known as dispersion, and it makes water waves both\ninteresting and complicated. Like a boat wake. To explain the shape of a boat wake, we’ll\nstart by looking at water waves of just a single wavelength (and speed). A boat traveling across this simpler water\ncreates a series of circular waves - if the water waves are faster than the boat, the\nwaves encircle it, but you don’t get a wake. If the waves are slower than the boat, the\nboat outruns them and the circles all add together to create a V-shaped wake. And if the waves are even slower, the boat\nwill outrun them even more and they’ll add together to a narrower V shape. Slower waves make narrower wakes. Faster waves make wider wakes. But we need to remember that water waves are\nwaves, that is, they repeat themselves. So every circular wave is really the first\nof a series of circular waves. This means that instead of creating just one\nv-shaped wake, a moving boat creates a train of v-shaped wakes that are each exactly one\nwavelength apart. The reason a real boat doesn’t make straight\nv-shaped wakes is that a real boat makes waves of many different wavelengths. And because of dispersion, different wavelengths\ntravel at different speeds: the longer ones travel faster and shorter ones travel slower. Faster waves create wider wakes, and because\nfaster waves also have longer wavelengths, that means that wider wakes are further apart. Similarly, slower waves create narrower wakes,\nand because slower waves also have shorter wavelengths, narrower wakes are closer together. When you add together narrow, closely spaced\nwakes, with wider, more widely spaced wakes, with even wider, even more widely separated\nwakes, and so on, voilá! The shape of a boat wake! Look at the beautiful repeating feathery ripples\nout on the edge, and the wider repeating arcs inside the wake itself. If you replace these sharp lines with smoother\nwaves at the appropriate angles and spacings, you get an even more convincing boat wake. And we can do the same again in 3D to get\na really realistic-looking boat wake. So in summary: wakes have the shape they do\nbecause water waves travel at different speeds. Slower water waves create narrow, closely\nspaced V-shaped wakes, and faster water waves create wider V-shaped wakes that are further\napart. When you add all these different v-shaped\npatterns together, at the correct angles and spacings determined by water's dispersion\nrelation, you end up with the unique shape of a water wake.

Termites, prairie dogs, and people are all\ngreat builders, each in their own way. And we all share one crucial problem. Put a bunch of us in a closed space, breathing\nOxygen in and CO2 out… and it doesn’t end well. Our tallest skyscrapers and deepest mines\nare almost completely cut off from outside air. To keep those inside from suffocating, human\nengineers use giant machines to bring in fresh air and pump stale air out. Termite mounds have the same problem. The largest are more than 10 meters high. On a human scale, that’s like a skyscraper\nthree and a half kilometers tall! Only instead of condos and offices, it holds\none big farm. The termites collect wood, which grows fungus,\nthat the termites eat. All that fungus and the millions of termites\nthat tend to it create a ton of CO2, which would suffocate the colony *and* their crops\nif it builds up. To keep the air fresh, the whole mound acts\nlike a big lung. During the day, the sun heats the outer chambers\nmore rapidly than the core, moving air up the outside and down the middle. During the night, this current reverses as\nthe outer chambers lose heat to the cool night air. The whole time, CO2 and oxygen are exchanged\nthrough tiny holes in the outer walls. What’s amazing is this is all constructed\nwithout a boss. No central architect designing the structure. Just instinct and cooperation lets termites\nbuild huge ventilation engines powered by nothing but daily temperature cycles. Leafcutter ants farm fungus on massive scales\ntoo. One colony in South America covered nearly\n50 square meters and was home to over 8 million ants! But unlike those towering termites, the ant\nlabyrinth reached 8 meters underground. So how do they ventilate their agricultural\ncity? Before we answer that, I want you to try something. Take a piece of paper, hold it under your\nlips, and let the other end curl down. If you blow only across the top of the paper,\nwhat do you think will happen? The force of the air hitting the paper should\npush it down, right? Well watch this. Here’s what’s happening: Air is a fluid. When I force air across the top of the paper,\nthat stream pulls other air along, due to viscosity, which is like the friction of\nfluids. This leaves an area of low pressure behind, and the paper is pulled up to fill\nit. This is called the Coandă effect. What does that have to do with ants? Check this out. When a breeze flows over a hill, the air is\ndeflected over the top. This pulls air along too, just like when I blew over the paper, drawing air out of the ant hill along the\nway. The ants build lower entrances nearby, where\nair is drawn in to replace it, ventilating the whole colony with a little breeze. Prairie dogs get the same effect from their\nmounds. Breezes over taller hills draw air through\nthe connected tunnel system, keeping the whole town breathing fresh. There’s even a tiny shrimp that uses this\nsame system to keep fresh water flowing through its burrows. Persian and Egyptian architects have used\nsimilar structures to cool buildings for centuries, but tiny animals beat us to that technology\nby millions of years Nature is full of species that build their\nenvironment to suit them, countless expert animal architects. Sometimes, all you need to solve the most\ncomplex engineering problems is the awesome power of evolution, …and that’s a breath of fresh air. Stay curious.

motivations are unbelievably interesting I mean I find I've been working on this for a few years and I just find the topic still so amazingly engaging and interesting so I want to tell you about that the science is really surprising the science is a little bit freaky okay if we are not as endlessly manipulable and as predictable as you would think there's a whole set of unbelievably interesting studies I want to give you two that call into question this idea that if you reward something you get more of the behavior you want if you punish something you get less of it so let's talk let's go from London to the mean streets of Cambridge Massachusetts in the northeastern part of the United States and let's talk about a study done at MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology here's what they did they took a whole group of students and they gave them a set of challenges things like um memorizing strings of digits solving word puzzles other kinds of spacial puzzles even physical tasks like throwing a ball through a hoop okay they gave him these challenges and they said to incentivize their performance they gave them three levels of rewards okay so if you did pretty well you got a small monetary reward if you did medium-well you've got a medium monetary reward and if you did really well if you were one of the top performers you've got a large cash prize okay we've seen this movie before this is essentially a typical motivation scheme within organizations right we reward the very top performers we ignore the low performers and the other folks kind of in the middle okay you get a little bit so what happens they do the test they have these incentives here's what they found out one as long as the tasks involved only mechanical skill bonuses worked as they would be expected the higher the pay the better their performance okay that makes sense but here's what happens but once the tasks call for even rudimentary cognitive skill a larger reward led to poorer performance now this is strange right a larger reward led to poorer performance how can that possibly be now what's interesting about this is that these folks here who did this are all economists at two at MIT one at the University of Chicago one at Carnegie Mellon okay the top tier of the economics profession they're reaching this conclusion that seems contrary to what a lot of us learned in economics which is which is that the higher the reward the better their performance and they're saying that once you get above rudimentary cognitive skill it's the other way around which seems like this kind of the idea that these rewards don't work that way seems vaguely the left-wing and socialist doesn't it it's kind of this kind of weird socialist conspiracy for those of you who have those conspiracy theories I want to point out the so the notoriously left-wing socialist group that financed the research the Federal Reserve Bank so this is the mainstream of the mainstream coming to a conclusion that's quite surprising seems to defy the laws of behavioral physics so this is strange it's strange funny so what do they do they say let's this is this is freaky let's go test it somewhere else maybe that fifty dollars a sixty dollar prize isn't sufficiently motivating for an MIT student right so let's go to a place where fifty dollars is actually more significant relatively all right so we take the experiment we're gonna go to mathura india rural india where $50 $60 whatever the number was is actually significant sum of money so they replicated the experiment in india roughly as follows small rewards the equivalent of two weeks salary i'm sorry small performance low performance two weeks salary medium performance about a month salary high performance about two months salary okay so there's a real good incentives okay so you're gonna get a different result here well what happened though was that the people offered the medium reward did no better than the people offered the small reward but this time around the people offered the top reward they did worst of all higher incentives led to worse performance what's interesting about this is that it actually isn't all that anomalous this has been replicated over and over and over again by psychologists by some extent by sociologists and by economists over and over and over again for simple straightforward tasks those kinds of incentives if you do this then you get that they're great for the task that our algorithmic set of rules where you have to just follow along and get a right answer if then rewards carrots and sticks outstanding but when the task gets more complicated when it requires some conceptual creative thinking those kinds of motivators demonstrably don't work fact money is a motivator at work but in a slightly strange way if you don't pay people enough they won't be motivated what's curious about there's another paradox here which is that the best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table pay people enough so that they're not thinking about money and they're thinking about the work now once you do that it turns out there are three factors that the science shows lead to the better performance not to mention personal satisfaction autonomy mastery and purpose autonomy is our desire to be self-directed to direct our own lives now in many ways traditional notions of management run afoul of that management is great if you want compliance but if you want engagement which is what we want in the workforce today as people are doing more complicated sophisticated things self-direction is better let me give you some examples of this almost radical forms of self direction in the workplace that lead to good results let's start with this company right here Atlassian an Australian company it's a software company and they do something really cool once a quarter on a Thursday afternoon they say to their developers for the next 24 hours you can work on anything you want you can work on it the way you want you can work on it with whomever you want all we ask is that you show the results to the company at the end of those 24 hours and this fun kind of meeting not a Star Chamber session but this fun meeting with beer and cake and fun and other things like that it turns out that that one day of pure undiluted autonomy has led to a whole array of fixes for existing software a whole array of ideas for new products that otherwise had never emerged one day now this is not an if-then incentive this is not the sort of thing that I would have done three years ago before I knew this research I would have said you want people to be creative and innovative give them a freaking innovation bonus if you could do something cool I'll give you $2,500 they're not doing this at all they're essentially saying you probably want to do something interesting let me just get out of your way one day of autonomy produces things that had never emerged let's talk about mastery masteries are urged to get better at stuff we like to get better at stuff this is why people play musical instruments on the weekend you got all these people who are acting in ways at sea irrational economically they play musical instruments on weekends why it's not gonna get them a mate it's not gonna make them any money why are they doing it cuz it's fun cuz you get better at it and that's satisfying go back in time a little bit imagine I imagine this if I went to my first economics professor a woman named Mary Alice Shulman and I went to her in 1983 and said professor Shulman can I talk to you after class for a moment yeah just I got this inkling I got this idea for a business model I just want to run it past you here's how it would work you get a bunch of people around the world who are doing highly-skilled work but they're willing to do it for free and volunteer their time 20 sometimes 30 hours a week okay she's looking at you somewhat skeptically there oh but but I'm not done and then what they create they give it away rather than sell it it's gonna be huge I mean she would have she truly would have thought I was insane okay it seemed to fly in the face of so many things but what do you have you have Linux powering one out of four corporate servers and fortune 500 companies Apache powering more than the majority of web servers Wikipedia what's going on why are why are people doing this why are they why are these people many of whom are technically sophisticated highly skilled people who have jobs okay they have jobs they're working at jobs for pay doing challenging doing sophisticated technical technological work and yet during their limited discretionary time they do equally if not more technically sophisticated work not for their employer but for someone else for free that's a strange economic behavior economists would look into it why are they doing this it's overwhelmingly clear challenge and mastery along with making a contribution that's it what you see more and more is a rise of what you might call the purpose motive is that more and more organizations want to have some kind of transcendent purpose partly because it makes coming to work better partly because that's the way to get better talent and what we're saying now is in some ways when the profit motive becomes unmoored from the purpose motive bad things happen bad things ethically sometimes but also bad thing just like not good stuff like crappy products like lame services like uninspiring places to work that when the profit motive is is is paramount or when it becomes completely unhitch from the purpose motive it's just people don't do great thing more and more organizations are realizing this and sort of disturbing the categories between what's profit and what's and what's purpose and and I think that that actually heralds something interesting and I think that the companies that organizations that are flourishing whether they're profit for profit are somewhere in between are animated by this purpose motor let me give you a couple of examples here's the founder of Skype he says our goal is to be disruptive but in the cause of making the world a better place pretty good purpose here's Steve Jobs I want to put a ding in the universe all right that's the kind of thing that might get you up in the morning racing to go to work so I think that um that we our purpose maximizers not only profit maximizers I think the science shows that we care about mastery very very deeply and the science shows that we want to be self-directed and I think that the big takeaway here is that if we start treating people like people and not assuming that they're simply horses you know slower smaller better smelling horses if we get past this kind of ideology of carrots and sticks and look at the science I think we can actually build organizations and work lives that make us better off but I also think they have the promise to make our world just a little bit better you"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In one of the tests conducted at MIT, as long as the task only required mechanical skill, the following

{"page": 3, "lesson": 14, "title": "The importance of a breakdown", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/ZX4V0iKL", "transcript": {"en": "one of the great problems of human beings is that we're far too good at keeping going where experts are surrendering to the demands of the external world living up to what's expected of us and getting on with the priorities as others around us to find them we keep showing up and being an excellent boy or girl and we can pull this magical feat off for up to decades at a time without so much as an outward twitch or crack until suddenly one day much to everyone's surprise including our own we break the rupture can take many forms we can no longer get out of bed we fall into a catatonic depression we develop all-consuming social anxiety we refuse to eat we babble incoherently we lose command over part of our body we're compelled to do something extremely scandalous and entirely contrary to our normal selves we become wholly paranoid in a given area we refuse to play by the usual rules in our relationship we have an affair ramp up the fighting or otherwise poke a very large stick into the wheels of day-to-day life breakdowns are hugely inconvenient for everyone and so unsurprisingly there is an immediate rush to medicalize the problem and attempt to excise it from the scene so that business as usual can restart but this is to misunderstand what's going on when we break down a breakdown is not merely a random piece of madness or malfunction it's a very real albeit very inarticulate bid for health it is an attempt by one part of our minds to force the other into a process of growth self understanding and self-development which it has hitherto refused to undertake if we can put it paradoxically it's an attempt to jumpstart a process of getting well properly well through a stage of falling very ill the danger therefore if we merely medicalize a breakdown and attempt to shift it away at once is that we're going to miss the lesson embedded within our sickness a breakdown isn't just a pain though it is that too of course it's an extraordinary opportunity to learn the reason we break down is that we have not over many years flexed very much there were things we needed to hear inside our minds that we deftly put to one side there were messages we needed to heed bits of emotional learning and communicating we didn't do and now after being patient for so long far too long the emotional self is attempting to make itself heard in the only way it now knows how it has become entirely desperate and we should understand and even sympathise with its mute rage what the breakdown is telling us above anything else is that it must no longer be business as usual that things have to change or and this can be properly frightening to witness that death might be preferable why can't we simply listen to the emotional need calmly and in good time and avoid the melodrama of a breakdown because the conscious mind is inherently lazy and squeamish and so reluctant to engage with what the breakdown eventually has to tell us with brutality for years it refuses to listen to a particular sadness or there is a dysfunction in a relationship we're in flight from or there are desires we sweep very far under the proverbial carpet we can compare the process to a revolution for years the people press the government to listen to their demands and adjust for years the government makes token gestures but shuts its ears until one day it's simply too much for the people who stormed the palace gates destroy the fine furnishings and shoot randomly at the innocent and the guilty mostly in revolutions there is no good outcome the legitimate grievances and needs of the people are not addressed or even discovered there's an ugly civil war sometimes literally suicide the same is true of breakdowns yet a good mental physician is hard to listen to rather than censor the illness they detect within its oddities a plea for more time for ourselves for a closer relationship for a more honest fulfilled way of being for acceptance of who we really are sexually that's why we started to drink or to become reclusive to grow entirely paranoid or manically seductive a crisis represents an appetite for growth that hasn't found another way of expressing itself many people after a horrific few months or years of breakdown will say you know I don't know how I'd ever have gotten well if I hadn't fallen ill in the midst of a breakdown we often wonder whether we have gone mad we have not we're behaving oddly no doubt but beneath the surface agitation we are on a hidden yet logical search for health we haven't become ill we were ill already our crisis if we can get through it is an attempt to dislodge us from a toxic status quo and it represents an insistent call to rebuild our lives on a more authentic and sincere basis thank you for commenting liking and subscribing we also offer

{"page": 3, "lesson": 15, "title": "Why you don’t hear about the ozone layer anymore", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/auTA0397", "transcript": {"en": "\"1980.\" The 80s were all about \nbig hair, neon, MTV. And then there was this: \"Every October a hole appears in the \nozone layer over the south pole.\" \"...hole in the ozone shield is the size\nof the continental United States.\" \"The protective ozone layer is \nbeing threatened as never before.\" \"We are all at risk.\" Scientists warned that humanity was on track\nto completely destroy the ozone layer by 2050. Without it ecosystems would collapse, skin cancer rates would skyrocket, and life as we knew it would cease to exist. But today, the ozone layer is healing. In an unprecedented act, the world came together\nto prevent an environmental catastrophe. So how did we do it? And what can we learn from it? The ozone layer is a sort of “belt” around\nthe Earth made up of gaseous molecules. It protects every living thing by absorbing two types of \nultraviolet radiation from the Sun. It’s a powerful shield, but \nit’s also fragile. In 1985, scientists discovered a \nmassive loss of ozone here:  right over Antarctica. 40% of the layer had dissipated,\ncreating a “hole”. Scientists realized the hole formed in the\nspring and every year it got worse. This was a wake up call. It wasn't small and far in the future. It was now and way bigger \nthan anybody ever imagined. That’s Dr. Solomon, an atmospheric chemist. In 1986, she flew to Antarctica, \nalong with other scientists to investigate the cause of the ozone hole. “Leading the team is Susan Solomon, a young atmospheric chemist \nfrom Boulder, Colorado.\" You know once you step off the plane in Antarctica, if you've never been there before, your main goal is to get out \nwithout getting frostbite. \"Do you want to do the next one?\" But what really our goal was to take measurements, not just of ozone, but also of different chemicals\nthat would help to show why it was going away. Some scientists released balloons in the sky\nto take ozone measurements. While others took measurements on the ground. And they all came to the same conclusion. The biggest problem was chlorine from a man-made\ncompound called Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. On the ground CFCs aren’t harmful. But once they float up to the stratosphere\nthe Sun breaks them down into chlorine. They bind with ozone to make \noxygen and chlorine monoxide. Then the loose oxygen atoms \nbump the chlorine atom out, freeing it to destroy more ozone molecules. And that causes a chain reaction. The long lifetime of the chlorofluorocarbons\nis a big part of the problem. They live anywhere between 50 and 150 years\nin our atmosphere so... It means that every year that you use what you use the year before \nis almost entirely still there. So it just builds up and builds up exponentially. And back then we used a lot of CFCs. The US had already moved away \nfrom CFCs in aerosol cans. But most of the world hadn’t yet. And they were still in everything from refrigerators\nand air conditioners and styrofoam. The entire world needed to make a big change\nquickly or we’d face-- Catastrophe. Catastrophe. Unmitigated catastrophe. In 1987, ozone levels had dropped \nby 50 percent. This growing threat led to some of the fastest\ncollective action on climate we've ever seen. So I like to think of it as, there's three\nP's that when, they’re met we do very well at addressing environmental problems. So it was personal. It was perceptible and the solutions \nwere practical. If you've been sunburned, you know that \nskin cancer is not a good thing. So everybody understands skin cancer. The personal nature of the threat is huge. The perceptible was easy to do \nwith satellite measurements. You can just watch it get \ncompletely destroyed and go to zero where there should have been a lot of ozone. And we have practical solutions. It was easy to find substitutes for \nchlorofluorocarbons in spray cans that took, you know, less than a year to do. It was a very straightforward switch, And I think the main unifying factor \nin all of that is the public. Scientists like Dr. Solomon held \npress conferences to inform the public. \"I think we will eventually see large scale\ndepletions of the ozone layer in other latitudes.\" The ozone hole started showing up \nin TV shows and movies. “It’s those damn fluorocarbons, they’ve\nbeen kicking the hell out of the ozone.” “Macaroni, it will burn off.” “Well so will the ozone, eventually.” And all this public awareness put pressure\non leaders around the world to act. “We are here today because we recognize\nthat urgent action is necessary.” And the Montreal Protocol made it official. It recognized “that world-wide emissions\ncan significantly deplete the ozone layer and result in adverse effects on human health\nand the environment.\" It listed control measures to reduce ozone\ndepleting substances in a series of steps. Including help for developing countries who need alternative technology \nand substituting products. Every single country eventually \nsigned the protocol. Making it the only universal treaty \nto ever be ratified. And the most successful environmental agreement\nin human history. Soon after, the world’s largest CFC producer\nbegan to phase them out. Since the protocol went into effect \non January 1st, 1989 the consumption of ozone-depleting substances  including CFCs, plummeted. Today, more than thirty years after \nthe Montreal Protocol was signed the ozone hole has stopped growing \nand is now shrinking. And by 2065 it is expected to \nhave recovered completely. But there’s more to be done. After the CFC ban we began using \nHydrofluorocarbons or HFCs. HFCs don’t deplete the ozone layer but they\nare a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. And it’s the fastest growing one. So in 2016, the Montreal Protocol \nwas amended to include HFCs and now they are being phased out too. But they are only one part \nof a larger issue. \"Climate change is already happening, \nright here, right now.\" \"Experts say that we have until 2030 \nto avoid catastrophe.\" \"People are suffering.\" \"People are dying.\" \"Entire ecosystems are collapsing.\" \"Unprecedented and even irreversible changes\nare happening to this planet.\" \"It is beyond any doubt that \nhuman activity is to blame.\" Climate change, our most challenging environmental\nproblem is still in need of big solutions. So I think people in most parts \nof the world, now understand and are concerned about, \nthe personal impact. They found it to be perceptible. And we are finding practical solutions. It's not true that we can't do it anymore. We need to keep our eye on the ball \non climate change. And if we do we will get the environment \nthat we demand."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Scientists in the 1980s warned that humanity was on track to completely destroy the ozone layer by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2015"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2025"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2050"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2060"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The biggest problem was _______, from a manmade compound called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carbon monoxide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Free radicals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fluoride"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chlorine"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Chlorofluorocarbons live for ________ years in our atmosphere.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50 to 150"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15 to 25"}, {"label": "C", "text": "75 to 95"}, {"label": "D", "text": "200 to 300"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "By _____ the ozone layer is expected to have recovered completely.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2035"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2065"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2045"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2075"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

If you live outside of Can-merica then you\nmight not know what a groundhog is so... here you go: this is a groundhog. They're basically giant grumpy squirrels who\ndig burrows underground. Burrows large enough, in fact, to occasionally\nmake their comfy home a structural hazard to your comfy home. This explains the first half of their name. The second half is because they're kind of\nfat -- though unlike their fellow Can-mericans -- when winter arrives they need their excess\nweight to go into hibernation. The story of the holiday is that on February\n2nd the wise groundhogs wake from hibernation to peek out of their burrow and look at the\nworld. If they see their shadow they go back inside\nwhich predicts six more weeks of winter. If they don't, then spring will come early. The holiday started in the 1800s as a Pennsylvania\nDutch custom of weather prediction and today is celebrated in Canada and 49 of the fifty\nstates, the exception being Alaska which in 2009 decided to forgo groundhog day in favor\nof marmot day. Outside of Alaska, many groundhogs contend\nwith each other to be the King of Seasonal Weather prediction their their main weapon\nin this war being their delightful names such as: Queen Charlotte and Sir Walter Wally in North\nCarolina, Shubenacadie Sam of Nova Scotia Staten Island Chuck from New York French Creek Freddie in West Virginia And... Gus from Athens Georgia though this last groundhog\nis somewhat overshadowed by his neighbor, General Beauregard Lee, who one must assume\nhas stylish facial hair and fans himself on the veranda of his plantation home while drinking\nMint Julep and pining for the day when the south will rise again. 1,000 miles north of the General, Wiarton\nWillie is the groundhog king of Canada, who throws an annual party to help him stay on\ntop and make sure that people keep building epic statues of him. But, if there could be only one, Punxsutawney\nPhil would be him. Not only is his name the most fun to say but\nhe also has quite a posse of top-hatted, tuxedoed men who look after him and call themselves\nthe inner circle. According to them, Punxsutawney Phil has been\nmaking predictions since the 1880s. Not a Punxsutawney Phil, mind you, but this\nPunxsutawney Phil who is functionally immortal because of a magic life-extending elixir the\ninner circle members prepare for him so that he can continue to make predictions -- and\nbring in tourist revenue -- until the end of time. He also speaks a language called groundhogese\nthat only the president of the inner circle can understand. If you think that Groundhog day is a dumb,\npointless holiday then, there are two things you should consider: 1st: you have no sense of fun and 2nd, you\nbetter be careful on Groundhog day, because in addition to their weather predicting day\njobs, these groundhogs also have the magical power to trap you in a infinite time loop\nuntil you learn to be less of a jerk.

But what about our bodies? Here are 5 crazy ways that social media and the internet are affecting your brain right now! Can’t log off? Surprisingly, 5-10% of internet users are actually unable to control how much time they spend online. Though it’s a psychological addiction as opposed to a substance addiction, brain scans of these people actually show a similar impairment of regions that those with drug dependence have. Specifically, there is a clear degradation of white matter in the regions that control emotional processing, attention and decision making. Because social media provides immediate rewards with very little effort required, your brain begin to rewire itself, making you desire these stimulations. And you begin to crave more of this neurological excitement after each interaction. Sounds a little like a drug, right? We also see a shift when looking at multi-tasking. You might think that those who use social media or constantly switch between work and websites are better at multitasking, but studies have found that when comparing heavy media\nusers to others, they perform much worse during task switching tests. Increased multi-tasking\nonline reduces your brains ability to filter out interferences, and can even make it harder\nfor your brain to commit information to memory. Like when your phone buzzes in the middle\nof productive work. Or wait...did it even buzz? Phantom Vibration Syndrome is a relatively\nnew psychological phenomenon where you think you felt your phone go off, but it didn’t.\nIn one study, 89% of test subjects said they experienced this at least once every two weeks.\nIt would seem that our brains now perceive an itch as an actual vibration from our phone.\nAs crazy as it seems, technology has begun to rewire our nervous systems - and our brains\nare being triggered in a way they never have been before in history. Social Media also triggers a release of dopamine\n- the feel good chemical. Using MRI scans, scientist found that the reward centres in\npeople’s brains are much more active when they are talking about their own views, as\nopposed to listening to others. Not so surprising - we all love talking about ourselves right?\nBut it turns out that while 30-40% of face-to-face conversations involve communicating our own\nexperiences, around 80% of social media communication is self involved. The same part of your brain\nrelated to orgasms, motivation and love are stimulated by your social media use - and\neven more so when you know you have an audience. Our body is physiologically rewarding us for\ntalking about ourselves online! But it’s not all so self involved. In fact,\nstudies on relationships have found that partners tend to like each other more if they meet\nfor the first time online rather than with a face to face interaction. Whether it’s\nbecause people are more anonymous or perhaps more clear about their future goals, there\nis a statistical increase in successful partnerships that started online. So while the internet\nhas changed our verbal communication with increased physical separation, perhaps the\nones that matter most end up even closer. Speaking of social media, we had you ask us\nquestions on twitter, instagram, facebook, tumblr, google+ and every other social platform\nwe could find and did a Q&A Video over on AsapTHOUGHT!

So stay like this, and\nthen lift up like this. Use this momentum to kick\nyour legs up even if you don't go all the way yet. And like bend your legs,\nand see if you can go to just the top of your head.  Just kidding. Hey. I'm Diana. You're watching \"Physics Girl.\" And last week, I got to\nhang out with contortionist and YouTuber, Sophie Dossi. We did some science\nexperiments for her channel. And while we were hanging out,\nI realized that, as a physicist, I know absolutely\nnothing about what stretching does to your\nbody and whether there is a scientifically-supported\nway of becoming more flexible. There is. Stay tuned. I didn't know, so I\nheaded over to USC to meet with a bio mechanist\nto find out the latest science.  I'm Michael Rowley. I am a PhD candidate\nin the division of biokinesiology\nand physical therapy.  My first question\nwas, is there something different about Sophie?  I'm just going to\nget into a back bend, and like lift up my feet.  Oh my gosh.  Yes, yes. Very different. But I mean, like\nbiomechanically, does she have a superpower?  There's evidence that people\nwho are hyper flexible--  Quick pause. Hyper flexible or hypermobile\nis actually a scientific term. And there is a test used to\ndetermine whether someone is hyper flexible. It's called the\nBeighton score, and I'll link to it in the description\nif you want to test yourself. OK. So people who are hypermobile--  Those people have a\nlittle bit more relatively of the more stretchy collagen\nthan the type I collagen.  Uh-huh. I need a quick refresher on\ncollagen. Take it away Michael.  So a bone to bone\nconnection is a ligament. And then a muscle to bone\nconnection is the tendon. Tendons and\nligaments are made up of mostly collagen, which\nis a type of protein. And there's different\ntypes of collagen. So tendons and ligaments have\nprimarily type I collagen, which is a really strong type,\nand then also some type III collagen, which will\nbe more stretchy, and then may also include\nsome elastin, which is another type of\nconnective tissue that's very elastic\nand stretchy. So the ratios of those\nthings can be different.  Got it. So Sophie might actually have\na different material makeup of the tissues in\nher body, like she might have more of that\ntype III collagen, which would allow her to do things\nthat the average person can't do.  Fact was, I almost can't\noverstretch anymore because I'm just completely in half. So it's like I have\npushed the limit on that, like there's just-- I mean you can't--\nyou're not a ghost. You're not a ghost.  But how flexible is Sophie?  Yeah. Before I started\ncontortion, I was always more flexible than\nthat average gymnast.  Oh, than even the\naverage gymnast.  Yes.  Not even the average person.  Yeah. When I was little,\nI use to watch TV with my feet over my head.  Yeah. That's flexible. OK. But how do you get\nflexible biomechanically? I guess my first question\nis, when you stretch, what parts of your body\nare stretching out? Yeah.  So when you stretch, you're\ngoing to increase flexibility and excursion in all those\ntissues-- muscles, tendons, ligaments. The most short-term, the\nfastest, most acute effects will be in the muscle.  So your tendons\nand your ligaments are stretching out too? How does that work? They seem so sturdy. This is getting to the heart\nof what I really, really want to know, which is, what\nis physically happening to all of these tissues?  The actual pieces\nof physiology that change with stretching,\nthe body will change the water content in the material. That's probably the fastest way. And then you can\nalso induce some stem cells that still live in\nthe tendon material themselves. And those can differentiate\ninto more cells. They can produce more\nor slightly different types of febrile or\nproteins like that collagen that I talked about.  Humph. So your body can change\nthe material properties of your tissues by stretching? Cool.  Another way is that you\nactually modify sensation. So you might experience some\nmild pain the first time you're going to stretch,\nbut you'll actually desensitize yourself to\nthat pain over repeated stretching multiple days\na week for multiple weeks.  Hold up. Really?  Yeah.  One way of getting\nmore flexible is just becoming\nmore numb to pain?  It actually really feels good. It feels like a\nnice, good stretch. It doesn't feel like\na hurt stretch at all.  Crazy. I have no chance.  Another change that\nhappens physiologically with stretching, our muscles have\nan alpha-gamma reflex loop. So when you stretch\nyour muscle, there's this automatic signal that\ngets sent to the spinal cord. It doesn't even go up\nto the brain and back. The spinal cord then tells\nthe muscle to contract. That coactivation would be\nbad for stretching, right? If you're stretching the\nmuscle, and then the muscle's trying to pull back on you. So over time, you can actually\ndown regulate that reflex loop, and that's been shown to\nhappen when you stretch for long periods of time. Lastly, you actually add\nlength to the muscle fibers. And you do that by\nadding sarcomeres, which are sort of\nthe contractile unit producing the active\ncontraction of muscles.  Wow. Bodies are so complicated. So let's recap. Stretching can change the\nwater content in your muscles, stem cell differentiation,\nhow much you feel pain, that alpha-gamma reflex\nloop from your muscles to your spinal cord, and the\nlength of your muscle fibers. That's cool. Now I know what's going on\nwhen you get more flexible. Biomechanics is cool, almost\nas awesome as physics-- maybe more useful though-- which\nbrings me to my last question. What does science have to say\nabout how to get more flexible? Well, Michael pointed me\nto this really interesting meta-analysis, which is like\na big study that actually synthesizes all the\nfindings from other studies, in this case, 23\nother studies, which looked at how to get the best\nbenefits on improved range of motion, or flexibility. And they found that\nstatic stretching, that is when you\nease into a stretch and then hold it for 30\nto 60 seconds, that's the best for improved range\nof motion, or flexibility. And as far as how\nmuch to stretch, they found that\nfive minutes total per week of one muscle group\nwas sort of the lower limit. But you didn't see much more\nof a benefit over 10 minutes a week of stretching. And six days out of the week was\nthe plateau of seeing returns. So the more you\nstretch per day doesn't keep increasing the\nbenefits, but that frequency, six days a week and\nthen the five minutes total for that week,\nis what's important. So commence operation\nstretching muscle group for six days a week,\nfive minutes total. Now, of course, different\ntypes of stretching have different\nbenefits, so I will link to some of the other\nliterature in the description. But more importantly\nin the description is the video that I did over\nwith Sophie on her channel. I channeled my inner YouTuber,\nand we did a challenge where all the science\nexperiments I was doing, Sophie had to do with her feet. She's insane. It was amazing. I had so much fun filming with\nher, so check out that video and subscribe to\nSophie's channel. And thank you to\nMichael at USC who blew my mind with biomechanic facts.

{"page": 3, "lesson": 21, "title": "Why humans are so bad at thinking about climate change", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/Lr7XmLJ5", "transcript": {"en": "\"We are hurtling toward the day when climate\nchange could be irreversible.\" \"Rising sea levels already altering this nation’s\ncoast.\" \"China’s capital is choking in its worst\npollution of the year.\" \"5% of species will become extinct.\" \"Sea levels rising, glaciers melting.\" Okay. Enough. I get it. It’s not like I don’t care about polar\nbears and melting ice caps. I’m a conservation scientist, so of course\nI care. I’ve dedicated my entire career to this. But over the years, one thing has become clear\nto me: We need to change the way we talk about climate change. This doom-and-gloom messaging just isn’t\nworking; we seem to want to tune it out. And this fear, this guilt, we know from psychology\nis not conducive to engagement. It's rather the opposite. It makes people passive, because when I feel\nfearful or guilt-full, I will withdraw from the issue and try to think about something\nelse that makes me feel better. And with a problem this overwhelming, it’s\npretty easy to just turn away and kick the can down the road. Somebody else can deal with it. So it’s no wonder that scientists and policymakers\nhave been struggling with this issue too. So I like to say that climate change is the\npolicy problem from hell. You almost couldn't design a worse problem\nas a fit with our underlying psychology or the way our institutions make decisions. Many Americans continue to think of climate\nchange as a distant problem: distant in time, that the impacts won't be felt for a generation\nor more; and distant in space, that this is about polar bears or maybe some developing\ncountries. Again, it’s not like we don’t care about\nthese things — it’s just such a complicated problem. But the thing is, we’ve faced enormous,\nscary climate issues before. Remember the hole in the ozone layer? As insurmountable as that seemed in the 1970s\nand ’80s, we were able to wrap our heads around that and take action. People got this very simple, easy to understand,\nconcrete image of this protective layer around the Earth, kind of like a roof, protecting\nus, in this case, from ultraviolet light, which by the way has the direct health consequence\nof potentially giving you skin cancer. Okay, so now you've got my attention. And so then they came up with this fabulous\nterm, the “ozone hole.” Terrible problem, great term. People also got a concrete image of how we\neven ended up with this problem. For decades, chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs,\nwere the main ingredient in a lot of products, like aerosol spray cans. Then scientists discovered that CFCs were\nactually destroying the atmospheric ozone. People could look at their own hairspray and\nsay, “Do I want to destroy the planet because of my hairspray? I mean, god no.” And so what's interesting is that sales of\nhairspray and those kinds of products and underarm aerosols started dropping quite dramatically. People listened to scientists and took action. Now scientists predict that the hole in the\nozone layer will be healed around 2050. That’s actually pretty amazing. And while stopping the use of one product\nis actually pretty easy, climate change caused by greenhouse gases … that’s much trickier. Because the sources are more complicated,\nand for the most part, they’re totally invisible. Right now, there is CO2 pouring out of tailpipes,\nthere is CO2 pouring out of buildings, there is CO2 pouring out of smokestacks, but\nyou can't see it. The fundamental cause of this problem is largely\ninvisible to most of us. I mean, if CO2 was black, we would have dealt\nwith this issue a long time ago. So CO2 touches every part of our lives — our\ncars, the places we work, the food we eat. For now, let’s just focus on one thing:\nour energy use. How do we make that visible? That was the initial goal of UCLA’s Engage\nproject, one of the nation’s largest behavioral experiments in energy conservation. What we're trying to do is to figure out how\nto frame information about electricity usage so that people save energy and conserve electricity. The idea is that electricity is relatively\ninvisible to people. The research team outfitted part of a student\nhousing complex with meters that tracked real-time usage of appliances and then sent them weekly\nreports. So you can see how much energy the stove used\nversus the dishwasher or the fridge. We realized, because of this project, the\nfridge was like the monster. So lucky for them, their landlord upgraded\ntheir fridge to an energy-efficient one. They also learned other energy-saving tips,\nlike unplugging their dishwasher when not in use and air-drying their clothes during\nthe summer months. And researchers, in turn, discovered where\npeople were willing to cut back. The Engage project wanted to know what types\nof messaging could motivate people to change their behavior. We wanted to see over time over a year and\nwith repeated messages, how do people, behave? How does that impact the consumer behavior? And what we found is that it's very different. Some households were sent personalized emails\nwith their energy bill about how they could save money; others learned how their energy\nusage impacted the environment and children’s health. Those who received messages about saving money\ndid nothing. It was totally ineffective because electricity\nis relatively cheap. But emails sent that linked the amount of\npollutants produced to rates of childhood asthma and cancer — well, those led to an\n8% drop in energy use, and 19% in households with kids. Now, in a separate study, researchers brought\nsocial competition into the mix. First, they hung posters around a dorm building\nto publicly showcase how students were really doing: red dots for energy wasters, green\nfor those doing a good job, and a shiny gold star for those going above and beyond. This social pressure approach led to a 20%\nreduction in energy use. This strategy was also used at Paulina’s\ncomplex, and it definitely brought out her competitive streak. For me, the competition was what motivated\nme, because seeing your apartment number and telling you that you are doing at the average,\nbut you are not the best, was like, Why? I’m doing everything you are telling me\nto do. I always wanted the gold star, because it\nwas like, “Oh, my god, I want to be like the less consumption of energy in the whole\nbuilding.” And psychology studies have proved this. We are social creatures, and as individualistic\nas we can be, turns out we do care about how we compare to others. And yes, we do like to be the best. Some people don’t want to say, Oh, I'm like\nthe average. No, my usage is different and I want to be\nable to act on it. And people can act on it because with these\nmeters, they can now see their exact impact. A company called Opower is playing with this\nidea of social competition. They work with over 100 utility companies\nto provide personalized energy reports to millions of customers around the world. Now consumers can not only see their energy\nuse but how it compares to their neighbors’. Like the UCLA study found, this subtle social\npressure encourages consumers to save energy. It’s been so effective that in 2016, Opower\nwas able to generate the equivalent of two terawatt-hours of electricity savings. That’s enough to power every home in Miami\nfor more than a year. And they’re not alone. Even large companies are tapping into behavioral\nscience to move the dial. Virgin Atlantic Airways gave a select group\nof pilots feedback on their fuel use. Over the course of a year, they collectively\nsaved over 6,800 tons of fuel by making some simple changes:\nAdjusting their altitudes, routes, and speed reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by\nover 21,000 tons. These behavioral “nudges” do seem to be\nadvancing how we as a society deal with some pretty complicated climate change issues,\nbut it turns out we’re just getting started. There is no “quick fix.” We need people changing their companies, changing\ntheir business models, changing the products and services they provide. This is about broader-scale change. And part of this change includes embracing\nwhat makes us human. That it can’t just be a guilt trip about\ndying polar bears or driving around in gas guzzlers. We need to talk about our wins, as well — like\nhow we’re making progress, really being aware of our energy use, and taking advantage\nof that competitive spirit we all have in order to really move us from a state of apathy\nto action. Global warming is by far the biggest issue\nof our time. Climate Lab is a new series from Vox and the\nUniversity of California, and we’ll be exploring some surprising ways we can tackle this problem.

I mean literally today anything I want is\navailable to me 24/7. I can buy anything anytime. In fact 79% of Americans shop online. This happens when they’re laying in bed,\nwhile they’re out with friends having a drink. It turns out actually one in five us shop\nonline while we’re using the bathroom. All this stuff we’re buying magically appears\non our doorstep. But what effect does all this shopping have\non the planet? Delivery services ship a lot more packages\nnow because of online shopping. Since 2009 US Postal Service deliveries increased\nby 65%. And during the holidays, UPS deliveries have\nincreased by 260 million packages since 2010. Now for the most part, if you compare online\nshopping with driving to the store, online shopping has a smaller carbon footprint. But there’s a catch. It's only better for the environment if you\ndon't get rushed delivery. Most of us, including me, are choosing faster\ndelivery like two day shipping because most of the time it's free. Why wouldn’t we want it right away? But it isn’t just a time difference, it’s\nan environmental difference. All these faster deliveries mean more trucks\non the road and that’s causing more greenhouse gases. And that means more global warming. When we choose two-day shipping, deliveries\noften come in multiple packages. Let’s say I buy some dish soap and a pair\nof socks. The shipping warehouse near me might be out\nof dish soap, so they fly some in from another state. Meanwhile, those socks, they’re getting\nsent to me on a separate truck. Also, the company is trying to get it to me\nquickly, so trucks are often sent out only half full -- If there was more flexibility\nin timing, they could fill them up all the way. If you know you have five-day delivery window,\nyou can wait from all the products to come in from different sources, consolidate the\nshipment, and send it. And now you can wait for many customers’\norders to come in and consolidate that into, let’s say, a full truckload. This is Miguel Jaller. He studies sustainable transportation at the\nUniversity of California, Davis. By picking the longer delivery window, I’m\ngiving the company more time to find the most efficient way to get a product to me. Another problem is with returns. So one of the things that companies made is\noffering this reliable and fast and almost free return option. So now as a customer, I can actually try the\nproduct, even if I don’t have any store to go to, because if I don’t like it or\nit doesn’t fit, I can actually return it at no cost. So like with buying clothes, if I shop online\nand pick the ‘try before you buy’ option, it would be like saying a delivery truck is\ndriving back and forth just to find me the right stuff. So what are companies trying to do? When you think of the future of online shipping,\nyou might imagine drones and driverless cars. But today’s solutions are more about keeping\ntraffic moving along, like with wifi traffic lights that let truckers know ahead of time\nwhen the light will turn red. This cuts down on idling at the light and\nwasting fuel. We’re now starting to transmit the timing\nof those traffic lights, in anticipation for that, they might want to speed up a little\nbit or slow down or do these certain little velocity changes so that they increase their\nchances of getting through that light. This is Matt Barth at the University of California,\nRiverside. He’s looking at ways trucks can reduce their\ntransit footprint. You can essentially smooth out your patterns\nof travel. And when you smooth out your travel patterns,\nyou get those fuel-economy benefits. Cities like San Jose and Las Vegas are already\ntesting out this traffic light technology. You can save 15 to 20 percent fuel just by\ndoing those type of activities. And on the highway, trucks are now starting\nto talk to each other -- it’s called truck platooning. You can think of it like cruise control except\nits transmitting the truck’s speed to the other vehicles following behind. This lets all the trucks drive in unison at\nthe same speed close behind each other. What they’re doing is trying to reduce the\ndrag. The narrow gaps they create between each other\nshields the trucks that are following from wind resistance. And so there’s been a number of experiments\nworldwide that have shown, you know, you can get 10 to 15, 20 percent energy savings, fuel\nsavings by doing that type of platooning. Now delivery companies have been tackling\nfuel use and emissions for decades. Take UPS. Since the 1970s they’ve encouraged drivers\nto eliminate left hand turns, reducing their emissions by 100,000 metric tons. That’s like taking 21,000 cars off the road. So there are ways companies can shrink their\ncarbon footprint, but what if they were better about changing customer behavior – like\ngetting us to be conscious about how we shop online? I’ve always picked that 2 day option because\nto be honest never really thought about it, but what if companies offered a green option? So if you just check a box they would just\nship stuff to you in the most energy efficient way possible. Sure, maybe it takes a little bit longer,\nbut that’s something I’d actually be willing to do. I mean every now and again, I might need something\nright away. But I probably don’t need to overnight a\ndelivery of socks to my front door. You probably do a lot of your online shopping\nwith your smartphone. Well watch our other episode to see what kind\nof impact these devices have on our planet."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Often, choosing two day shipping means", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "you don't have to pay for it to get to you"}, {"label": "B", "text": "increased greenhouse gases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "delivery trucks that may not be completely filled"}, {"label": "D", "text": "more than one package will be used to get the products to where they are going"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "How are cities trying to cut idling time down?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "no traffic signals, just STOP signs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "putting in more railroad tracks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wi-fi traffic lights that tell the driver when the light will change red"}, {"label": "D", "text": "driverless cars"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does truck platooning involve?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "delivery trucks racing to see who arrives with their deliveries first"}, {"label": "B", "text": "trucks that are near each other transmitting information about speed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "reduction of drag"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both b and c"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above are great answers"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
