There are over four times as\nmany livestock as people. Farmed cattle alone weigh\nnearly ten times as much as all wild mammals combined. So imagine if a wizard of meatless\ndining suddenly appeared and with one wave of a wand wiped\naway all meat from our shelves— along with any desire to eat it. Farm animals destined for food vanish—\nwhisked away to another planet. What happens in the following days,\nyears, and even millennia? Overnight, food related greenhouse gas\nemissions drop by about 63%. We no longer get protein\nand key nutrients from the approximately\n70 billion chickens, 1.5 billion pigs, 300 million cattle, and 200 million tons\nof fish and shellfish processed for consumption each year. To help fill this nutritional gap, our demand for fruits, vegetables,\nand legumes go up— a diet that most dietitians agree contains\nall of the nutrients we need for a healthy life. But initially there aren’t enough\nof these foods to go around. The rise in demand causes\nproduce costs to soar. In regions like Mongolia, where the harsh environment makes\nit difficult to grow vegetables, a sudden lack of meat leaves\npeople with little to eat. Cultures built around meat\nlose their foundations. Members of salmon-eating tribes in the\nPacific Northwest of the United States, for example, lose not only\nsustenance and livelihoods, but an integral component\nof their religion. Tens of millions of anglers lose work\nthat was already threatened by dwindling fish populations. As the meat industry collapses, many households in developing countries\nare left scrambling for income that once came from livestock farming. Some meat producers shift\nto agricultural crops, which leave workers—\nand neighboring communities— less susceptible to respiratory diseases\nassociated with livestock production. As crop agriculture expands,\nprices come down. Ultimately, vegetarianism becomes less\nexpensive than meat-eating in most countries. Luckily, we don’t need to clear\nnew farmland to grow all this food. Without animals raised for meat, land that had been used to grow\nfeed is now available. All things considered,\nour new diets require less land and water. Millions of deaths are avoided every year, thanks in part to lower rates\nof heart disease, cancer, and other conditions associated\nwith red meat consumption. We no longer contract new pathogens\nfrom wild animals hunted for food, or novel influenza viruses\nfrom farmed pigs, or drug-resistant superbugs that develop\nin beef cattle that have been preemptively\nfed antibiotics. As the years pass,\nglobal biodiversity rises as habitat loss, pesticide use, and other\npressures from agriculture subside. Amazonian birds have more\nforest to fly over. Fewer cheetahs are shot for stalking\ntoo close to livestock. Bee, wasp, and butterfly communities\nthrive as natural areas expand. In turn, insect-pollinated crops\nproduce higher yields. Many ocean species rebound\nfrom overfishing. Throughout history,\nhumans in traditionally vegetarian regions have evolved a genetic mutation that helps them more efficiently\nprocess fats from plants. So over thousands of years, our bodies may evolve to make\nthe most of our veggies. Or we may lose some adaptations, like the\nability to extract iron from meat. Of course, a wizard will not\nturn our world meatless. Though many individuals are choosing\nto go vegetarian, globally, meat eating\nis still on the rise. This trend spells trouble for our climate. Even if we suddenly stopped burning\nfossil fuels, business as usual food systems paired\nwith a growing population would push global temperatures over 1.5°C\nby the end of the century. Cattle are the biggest culprit. Beef and dairy production are responsible\nfor over 60% of all food-based emissions, while only providing around 18%\nof the world's calories. In fact, diets containing modest portions\nof meats like chicken often produce less greenhouse gas\nthan vegetarian diets high in dairy. Reducing beef, cheese, and milk\nconsumption could go a long way toward achieving many of the benefits\nof a meatless world— no magic required."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "There are ______ times the amount of livestock as there are people on the plant", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A meat-free diet requires less land and water than a meat-filled diet.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is a benefit of transitioning less or no meat?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less disease"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Less cost"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increase health and life expectancy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "More biodiversity"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Higher crop yields"}, {"label": "F", "text": "Oceans species rebound from overfishing"}, {"label": "G", "text": "Lower greenhouse gas emissions"}, {"label": "H", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": null}, {"question": "Beef and dairy production are responsible for more than ___ of all food based emissions, while providing about ___ of the world's nutrients.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "30%, 1%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40%, 4%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50%, 8%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "60%, 18%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A high dairy vegetarian diet produces less green house gasses than meals with modest meat portions such as chicken.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Richardson", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-hidden-life-of-rosa-parks-riche-d-richardson", "transcript": {"en": "In 1944, 11 years before her fateful \ndecision on a Montgomery Bus, Rosa Parks was investigating \na vicious crime. As an emissary for \nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, she had traveled to rural Alabama \nto meet with Recy Taylor, a young woman who had been \nsexually assaulted by six white men. It would be difficult enough to convince\nan Alabama court that even one of these men was guilty, but Rosa was undeterred. She formed a committee to defend \nRecy in court, flooding the media with testimony and sparking protests \nthroughout the South. When a jury failed \nto indict the attackers, Parks demanded the governor \nassemble a new grand jury. She wrote, “I know that you will not fail\nto let the people of Alabama know that there is equal justice \nfor all of our citizens.” Throughout her life, Parks repeatedly \nchallenged racial violence and the prejudiced systems \nprotecting its perpetrators. But this work came at an enormous risk— and a personal price. Born in 1913, Rosa was raised by her \nmother and grandparents in rural Alabama. But outside this loving home, the fear \nof racial violence cast a long shadow. The Ku Klux Klan frequently \ndrove past their home, and Jim Crow laws \nsegregated public spaces. At 19 she settled in Montgomery\nand married Raymond Parks, a barber who shared her growing fury \nat racial injustice. He was involved with the local chapter\nof the NAACP; a role many avoided \nfor fear of persecution. At first Raymond was eager \nto keep Rosa safe from the potential dangers of activism. But as she grew more incensed at the\nlimitations imposed on African Americans, she could no longer stand by. When she officially joined \nthe NAACP in 1943, Parks and Johnnie Rebecca Carr were \nthe only women in the Montgomery chapter. She began keeping minutes \nfor their meetings, and soon found herself elected \nsecretary of the chapter— formally beginning her secret double life. By day, Rosa worked as a seamstress\nto support her mother and husband. By night, she researched and documented\nnumerous civil rights cases, from local policy disputes to high-profile\nmurder cases and hate crimes. As secretary, she prepared public \nresponses on behalf of the Montgomery chapter,\nbattling the harsh sentencing, false accusation and smear campaigns \nfrequently used against African Americans. In addition to her legal work, Parks \nwas a brilliant local strategist. As advisor to the NAACP \nyouth group council, she helped young people navigate \nsegregated systems including voter registration and \nwhites-only libraries. Through the cover of the NAACP, Parks strived to bring clandestine \ncivil rights activities into the open. She advocated for civil disobedience\ntraining and spoke out against racial violence,\nparticularly the murder of Emmet Till. In 1955, her refusal to move \nto the back of a segregated bus helped ignite the grassroots movement \nshe had hoped for. Parks was arrested and jailed \nfor her one-woman protest, where she was visited by local activists. Together they planned a twenty-four \nhour bus boycott. It lasted for three hundred \nand eighty-one days. Park’s simple act had transformed \nnascent civil rights activism into a national movement. In 1956, the boycott ended \nwhen the Supreme Court ruled in favor of desegregating \npublic transport. But this victory for the movement \nhad come at a great cost. Rosa had been receiving vicious death \nthreats throughout the campaign, and was unable to find work in Montgomery\nbecause of her political reputation. In 1957, she moved to Detroit \nto continue working as a seamstress, until being hired by Congressman \nJohn Conyers to help support his burgeoning \ncivil rights campaigns. Ever vigilant in the fight against racial \ninequality, Parks remained active \nfor the next 40 years. She wrote several books, traveled across the country giving talks\nto support other activists, and established an institute \nfor the education of young people in her late husband’s memory. Today, Rosa Parks is remembered \nas a radical spirit who railed against the most powerful \npeople and policies.

You make crude tools, hunt,\nand gather food and materials, until, eventually, you perish. But this is only the beginning. Because after dying, you travel \nback in time to be reincarnated as the second human ever to live. While you don't remember your former life, your previous actions affect\nyou nonetheless. And after dying once more, you return \nas the third person, then the fourth, the fifth, and so on— living the lives of every single human \nthat’s ever walked the Earth. Strung end to end, these lives \nlast almost 4 trillion years. Since you only recall the life \nyou’re currently living, your psyche doesn’t carry the entire\nweight of human history. However, each of your lifetimes still has\na profound impact on your future selves. Sometimes your influence \non the world is obvious, but these major historical figures \nonly account for a tiny fraction of your experience. Instead, your existence consists \nmostly of ordinary lives, filled with everyday tasks like eating,\nlaughing, working, and worrying. For approximately one tenth\nof your 4 trillion years, you’re a hunter-gatherer. For 60%, you’re an agriculturalist,\ndeveloping tools and techniques which you employ over roughly \n800 billion years of working on farms.

The volume was thin enough\nto be completely hidden, but its content was \nfar from insubstantial. In fact, at the time, many members \nof the US government considered this pamphlet to be one \nof the most dangerous documents in American history. So to ensure this volume\nreached his audience, Walker had to hide his work \nin the clothing of both willing co-conspirators \nand unknowing sailors; smuggling the pamphlet \nthroughout the country. But what was this incendiary document? \nAnd who exactly was the man who wrote it? Son of an enslaved father\nand a freedwoman, David Walker was born free \nin the late 18th century in Wilmington, North Carolina. From a young age, he sought to extend \nhis freedom to all Black Americans, and after moving to Charleston\nas a young man, he became closely involved with the\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church. At that time, the mainstream movement \nto end slavery was comprised of societies led by wealthy white men \nwho favored gradual change and avoided confrontation\nwith slaveholders. But the AME Church practiced\na more radical brand of abolition. In 1822, AME leader Denmark Vesey\nplanned a major insurrection intended to violently liberate \nCharleston’s enslaved community and set the city ablaze. It’s unclear if Walker contributed\nto Vesey’s plan, but he wasn’t among the many AME members\nwho were arrested and executed for this attempted rebellion. In 1825, Walker surfaced in Boston, where\nhe rejoined the fight against slavery. In addition to marrying \nfellow activist Eliza Butler and opening his clothing store, Walker helped fund America’s\nfirst Black-owned newspaper. Is passionate articles and public speeches\nsought to instill pride and camaraderie into those fighting for Black liberation. But to truly unite free \nand enslaved Black Americans, Walker would have to go beyond Boston. In 1829, he poured his ideas into the “Appeal to the Colored Citizens \nof the World.” This treatise was punctuated\nwith furious exclamation marks and emphasized the spiritual righteousness\nof resistance. He described the suffering of enslaved\npeople in graphic detail to prove that the reality for Black Americans\nwas often “kill or be killed.” And given these circumstances, Walker staunchly defended \nthe right to militant action. This wasn’t his only departure \nfrom moderate mainstream abolitionists. To stress the importance\nof Black solidarity, Walker connected American abolitionism with global movements \nfor Black liberation. He called for an international \nBlack freedom struggle in an early display of what would come\nto be called Pan-Africanism. But at the same time, \nhe opposed the popular movement for Black Americans to emigrate to Africa. While the “Appeal” criticized \nthe Founding Fathers for their hypocrisy, Walker insisted that Black people were\nessential to the country’s creation, and had an undeniable right\nto American citizenship. Walker suspected \nthese incendiary arguments would make him a target for violence. But in spite of the danger, he continued \nusing sailors to smuggle his work. The “Appeal” traveled down the coast \ninto the hands of shopkeepers, church leaders, political organizers, \nand underground abolitionist networks. For these readers, Walker’s words\ngalvanized militant efforts to overthrow slave owners and its call to arms struck fear\ninto white officials. Police intercepted its delivery, and quarantined Black sailors\nat Southern ports. The pamphlet inspired Louisiana \nto ban anti-slavery literature, and both North and South Carolina \ncracked down on Black education to prevent literacy \namong enslaved peoples. Southern officials even placed \na bounty on Walker’s head worth the modern equivalent\nof $322,000. But while friends urged him to flee,\nWalker refused to abandon his cause. Tragically, his bravery \ncouldn’t protect him from the deadliest disease of his time. In August 1830, Walker was found dead. And while his associates declared\nhim the victim of assassination, it’s now widely believed \nthat he died from tuberculosis. Following his death, Walker's message\ncontinued to resound. Frederick Douglass credited him \nas the originator of radical abolitionism, and his “Appeal” inspired some \nof the most influential members of the 20th century liberation movement. From Malcolm X’s militant approach\nto Black resistance, to James Cone’s writing\non Black spirituality, Walker’s legacy remains\ncrucially important to the history of Black resistance movements— and their visions for the future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "David Walker distributed his \"Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World\" from the abolitionist hotbed of _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Charleston"}, {"label": "B", "text": "New York City"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Boston"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Phoenix"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The political backlash against Walker’s \"Appeal\" included which of the following legislative responses in the American South?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Abolition of slavery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anti-literacy laws"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fugitive Slave Act"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Indentured Servitude Act"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "David Walker’s \"Appeal\" is key to the ideological genesis of which of the following movements?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pan-Africanism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tea Party movement"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Feminist movement"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Marxism"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In his \"Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World,\" David Walker argues against ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The plan to relocate African-Americans to Africa"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Declaration of Independence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Haitian slave revolt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Communism"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Most historians agree that David Walker succumbed to ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Racism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Assassination"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Back to Africa plan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tuberculosis"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Order! Who’s the defendant today?\nLooks pretty fancy. Indeed, Your Honor. This is Marie Antoinette,\nthe Queen of France who was notorious for living in opulence\nwhile the peasants starved. That is sensationalist slander. Marie Antoinette had little power\nover her circumstances and spent her brief life trying to survive\nin a turbulent, foreign country. You mean she wasn't French? That’s right, Your Honor. She was born in 1755 as the\nHapsburg Archduchess Maria Antonia. After two of her older sisters\npassed away, she became the only choice for a political\nmarriage to Louis-August, heir to the French throne. Essentially, she was sacrificed to secure\npeace between Austria and France, all at the age of 14. She seemed to have had adjusted\nto this “sacrifice” by 1774 when her husband was crowned king. She lived a life of luxury, \nwearing elaborate headdresses, importing foreign fabrics— she even had her own private chateau\nnear Versailles! Meanwhile, France was \nin an economic tailspin. Bad harvests resulted\nin mass food shortages, wages were falling,\nand the cost of living had skyrocketed. Marie Antoinette’s expensive tastes\nwere completely insensitive to the plight of her subjects. She was the Queen! If she hadn’t looked glamorous,\nshe would have been criticized. Besides, she sometimes used\nher image for good. After convincing the King to be\nvaccinated against smallpox, she commissioned a special headdress\nto make the treatment fashionable for all. She also used her influence to appoint\nunqualified friends and admirers to important posts. Even more disastrous, she encouraged\nthe King to get involved in the American Revolution, a conflict that cost France\n1.5 billion francs. Objection! The Queen had very little influence over\nher husband’s political decisions at that time. Besides, France’s financial crisis was\nmuch more related to the country’s outdated tax system and lack\nof an effective central bank. How so? While France's nobility and clergy\nhad numerous tax exemptions, peasants often paid more than half\ntheir income in taxes. This system buried France in debt\nlong before the Queen's arrival. Her personal expenses were\nmerely a scapegoat for decades of financial negligence. That doesn’t change that Marie Antoinette\nspent tax money on luxuries while the masses starved! She was so oblivious that when she heard\npeople couldn’t afford bread, she recommended they eat cake instead. This is almost certainly a fabrication\nattributed to the Queen by her enemies. In fact, Marie Antoinette frequently\nengaged in charity work focused on addressing poverty. Her reputation as a heartless queen\nwas based on rumors and slander. Even the most famous case against her\nwas a complete fraud. Pardon? In 1784, a thief forged fake letters\nfrom the Queen to purchase an outrageously expensive\ndiamond necklace. The truth came out eventually, but the public already saw\nher as a wasteful spendthrift. Meanwhile, it's really her husband\nwho ruined France's finances. On that, we agree. Louis XVI was an incompetent king. Even after the revolution began\nand he lost much of his power to the newly formed National Assembly, he refused to yield control. Louis vetoed numerous pieces\nof legislation— and he was supported \nby his conservative Queen. To a point. Marie Antoinette believed\nin the divine right of kings, but despite personal reservations,\nshe tried to work with reformers. Though all she got in return were false\nreports that she was sleeping with them. No amount of charity work could counter\nthis avalanche of slander. The revolutionaries also prevented\nthe King’s family from leaving Paris— how could she negotiate with people\nkeeping her prisoner? Well, they were right to do so! In 1791, the royal couple tried\nfleeing to Austria to gather support and regain power. Even after they were caught, the King and Queen continued\nto pass military secrets to their Austrian contacts. Isn't that treason? Certainly, and Louis was executed for it,\nalongside 32 other charges. Even if you believe the King's\nexecution was just, there's no excuse for how the new\ngovernment treated Marie Antoinette. She was separated from her son\nand kept in a cell with no privacy. The tribunal in charge of prosecuting \nthe Queen had no proof of her treason, so they denigrated her with baseless\naccusations of incest and orgies. Yet she maintained composure\nuntil the very end. The Queen’s final words were an apology\nto her executioner for stepping on his foot. However refined she may have been, Marie Antoinette was willing to betray\nher country to stay in power. In life and death, she remains a symbol\nof everything wrong with the decadent monarchy. A convenient symbol— and an example of the public’s appetite\nfor smearing prominent women with their own fantasies and frustrations. So what you’re saying is she\nwas guilty of being Queen? Should monarchs be judged \nby their personal qualities or the historical role they occupied? And can even the powerful be\nvictims of circumstance?

{"page": 78, "lesson": 6, "title": "What if cracks in concrete could fix themselves? - Congrui Jin", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-if-cracks-in-concrete-could-fix-themselves-congrui-jin", "transcript": {"en": "Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the most widely used construction material in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Concrete"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bricks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Plastic materials"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Composites"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How small does a concrete crack need to be in order for it to be healed via autogenous healing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "0.3 mm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3 mm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "0.03 mm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30 mm"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In the presence of a calcium source, what is one of the most suitable fillers for concrete cracks due to its high compatibility with concrete compositions and its ability to be precipitated by some species of bacteria or fungi?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Calcium oxalate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Calcium carbonate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Calcium chloride"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Calcium sulfate"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Microbes can completely repair cracks up to what size?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "0.3 mm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "0.5 mm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 mm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10 mm"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Microbes can completely repair cracks after roughly how long?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Three days"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Three weeks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Three years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Three months"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Collapsing near a small pool, the animal’s corpse \nthreatens to infect the water. But for the desert’s cleanup crew, \nthis body isn’t a problem: it’s a feast. Weighing up to 10 kilograms and possessing a wingspan \nof nearly 3 meters, the lappet-faced vulture \nis the undisputed king of the carcass. This bird’s powerful beak and strong neck easily tear through tough hide \nand muscle tissue, opening entry points \nfor weaker vultures to dig in. This colossal competition is too dangerous\nfor the tiny Egyptian vulture. With a wingspan of only 180 centimeters, this vulture migrated to Africa \nfrom his family nest in Portugal, using thermal updrafts to stay aloft \nfor hours at a time. But upon arrival, he finds himself near \nthe bottom of the pecking order. Fortunately, what he lacks in size, \nhe makes up for in intelligence. A short distance away, \nhe spots an unguarded ostrich nest, full of immense, but impenetrable eggs. Using a large rock, he smashes one open\nfor a well-earned meal— though he’ll circle back to the gazelle \nonce the larger birds are gone. High above the commotion \nare Ruppell’s Griffon vultures. Soaring at an altitude \nof over 11,000 meters, these birds fly higher \nthan any other animal. At this height, they can’t see \nindividual carcasses. But the sight of their fellow vultures \nguides them to the feeding. Their featherless heads help them regulate the sudden rise in temperature \nas they descend— and keep them clean \nas they tear into the decaying gazelle. The carcass is stripped clean in hours, well before the rotting meat \ninfects the water supply. And the tuberculosis doesn’t \nstand a chance at infecting the vultures. These birds have evolved the lowest \ngastric pH in the animal kingdom, allowing them to digest diseased \ncarrion and waste without becoming sick. In fact, species like \nthe mountain-dwelling bearded vulture have stomachs so acidic, they can digest most bones \nin just 24 hours. This adaptation helps smaller vultures \nsupplement their diet with dung, while larger vultures can consume \ndiseased meat up to 3 days old. Their acidic stomachs protect them \nfrom living animals too: their rancid vomit \nscares off most predators. These stomachs of steel are essential \nto removing pathogens like cholera, anthrax, and rabies \nfrom the African ecosystem. But while vultures can easily digest \nnatural waste, man-made chemicals are another story. Diclofenac, a common veterinary drug \nused to treat cattle in India, is fatal to vultures. And because local religious beliefs \nprohibit eating beef, scavengers often consume cattle carcasses. Since the 1990s, the drug, along with threats from electricity pylons\nand habitat loss, has contributed to a 95% decline \nin the region’s vulture population. In nearby Africa, \npoachers intentionally poison carcasses to prevent the birds’ presence from \nalerting authorities to their location. One poisoned carcass can kill \nover 500 vultures. Today, more than 50% of all vulture \nspecies are endangered. In regions where vultures \nhave gone extinct, corpses take three times longer to decay. These carcasses contaminate \ndrinking water, while feral dogs and rats carry \nthe diseases into human communities. The Asian and African Vulture Crisis \nhas led to an epidemic of rabies in India, where infections kill roughly \n20,000 people each year. Fortunately, some communities have already\nrealized how important vultures are. Conservationists have successfully banned\ndrugs like Diclofenac, while other researchers are working \nto repopulate vulture communities through breeding programs. Some regions have even opened \nvulture restaurants where farmers safely dispose \nof drug-free livestock. With help, vultures will be able \nto continue their role conserving the health of our planet—\ntransforming death and decay into life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Egyptian vultures evolved the ability to use tools.

The midwife, Xoquauhtli, \nhas a difficult choice to make. A momentous shift from rainy season \nto dry season is underway. All summer, the gods have kept \nthe people fed with corn, but the fertile summer months \nare disappearing. This day occurs during the festival \nthat marks the shift between the summer season,\nwhen the gods feed the people, and the winter season,\nwhen the people feed the gods in return. Xoquauhtli owes a debt \nto her patron, Teteoinnan, the female warrior goddess \nat the center of this festival. Teteoinnan wages war both \non women’s battlefields of birth and in men’s battles \nwith Tenochtilan’s enemies. She must be kept happy \nor she will bring bad luck. The midwife should participate \nin the festival today, but one of her patients could \ngo into labor any minute. Xoquauhtli decides to check \non her patient first. The expecting mother hasn’t \nworked too hard, chewed gum, or lifted heavy things. Her family is taking good care of her. Surely Xoquauhtli can take a little time \nto honor her goddess. She leaves her apprentice in charge \nand heads to the center of the city. Along the way, she sees women sweeping\nthe roads and hanging gourds in preparation for the festival. Finally, she reaches the Great Pyramid. On top are two temples: the north, where rituals honor \nthe rain god in the summer, and the south one is where rituals \nhonor the war god in the winter. On the equinox, the sun rises \nbetween the two sides. The ceremony begins with a mock battle \nbetween the midwives and the other physicians. Xoquauhtli’s team battles heartily, \nthrowing nochtles, marigolds, and balls made of reed and moss. They joke, call their rivals names, \nand laugh. But then, a girl comes running \nwith a message for Xoquauhtli. Her patient is in labor! She hurries back to the house. All the old women \nfrom the extended family have already gathered for the birth— their experience is very valuable \nif anything goes wrong. She readies herself with a prayer praising\nher most important tools, her fingers. Then she doses the patient with cihuapatli\nto help expel the baby, massages her in the sweathouse, \nand rubs her stomach with tobacco. Offering Teteoinnan a short prayer, she urges her patient \nto act like a warrior. A strong baby girl slips \ninto her waiting hands and the old women shout triumphant cries. Xoquauhtli takes a few drops of water \nfrom a jade bowl, breaths on them, and places them on the baby’s tiny tongue. She calls her a precious greenstone, \na little warrior, and tells her how the Lord and Lady \nof the Ninth Sky breathed life into her, sending her \nto this place of burden and torment. She then turns to the new mother, \npraising her, telling her she acted like \nan eagle warrior, a jaguar warrior. By the time they finish, it’s late, \nand the flames of the fire have died down. Xoquauhtli piles the remaining hot coals \nin the center of the hearth, stoking them to keep them going. She lays the baby in a woven basket, \nhead facing the warming fire. This will warm her tonalli, \nan important “soul” center in the body central to health and well-being. It’s almost midnight— \nif Xoquauhtli hurries, she can get back to the temple \nfor the culmination of the festival. She makes her way to the city center, \nwhere a priest carries a woman on his back to the top of the pyramid.

This agricultural revolution\nwas a turning point in our history that enabled people to settle,\nbuild and create. In short, agriculture\nenabled the existence of civilization. Today, approximately 40 percent\nof our planet is farmland. Spread all over the world, these agricultural lands\nare the pieces to a global puzzle we are all facing: in the future, how can we feed\nevery member of a growing population a healthy diet? Meeting this goal will require nothing short of a second\nagricultural revolution. The first agricultural revolution was characterized\nby expansion and exploitation, feeding people at the expense\nof forests, wildlife and water and destabilizing the climate\nin the process. That's not an option the next time around. Agriculture depends on a stable climate with predictable seasons\nand weather patterns. This means we can't keep\nexpanding our agricultural lands, because doing so will undermine\nthe environmental conditions that make agriculture possible\nin the first place. Instead, the next agricultural revolution will have to increase the output\nof our existing farmland for the long term while protecting biodiversity,\nconserving water and reducing pollution\nand greenhouse gas emissions. So what will the future farms look like? This drone is part of a fleet\nthat monitors the crops below. The farm may look haphazard but is a delicately engineered\nuse of the land that intertwines crops and livestock\nwith wild habitats. Conventional farming methods\ncleared large swathes of land and planted them with a single crop, eradicating wildlife and emitting huge amounts\nof greenhouse gases in the process. This approach aims to correct that damage. Meanwhile, moving among the crops, teams of field robots\napply fertilizer in targeted doses. Inside the soil, hundreds of sensors gather data\non nutrients and water levels. This information reduces\nunnecessary water use and tells farmers where they should apply\nmore and less fertilizer instead of causing pollution\nby showering it across the whole farm. But the farms of the future\nwon't be all sensors and robots. These technologies are designed\nto help us produce food in a way that works with the environment rather than against it, taking into account\nthe nuances of local ecosystems. Lower-cost agricultural practices\ncan also serve those same goals and are much more accessible\nto many farmers. In fact, many such practices\nare already in use today and stand to have\nan increasingly large impact as more farmers adopt them. In Costa Rica, farmers have intertwined farmland\nwith tropical habitat so successfully that they have significantly contributed\nto doubling the country's forest cover. This provides food\nand habitat for wildlife as well as natural pollination\nand pest control from the birds and insects\nthese farms attract, producing food while restoring the planet. In the United States, ranchers are raising cattle\non grasslands composed of native species, generating a valuable protein source using production methods that store carbon\nand protect biodiversity. In Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, new approaches to rice production may dramatically decrease\ngreenhouse gas emissions in the future. Rice is a staple food\nfor three billion people and the main source of livelihood\nfor millions of households. More than 90 percent of rice\nis grown in flooded paddies, which use a lot of water and release 11 percent\nof annual methane emissions, which accounts for one to two percent of total annual greenhouse gas\nemissions globally. By experimenting with new strains of rice, irrigating less and adopting less labor-intensive\nways of planting seeds, farmers in these countries have already increased\ntheir incomes and crop yields while cutting down\non greenhouse gas emissions. In Zambia, numerous organizations\nare investing in locally specific methods to improve crop production,\nreduce forest loss and improve livelihoods for local farmers. These efforts are projected\nto increase crop yield by almost a quarter\nover the next few decades. If combined with methods\nto combat deforestation in the region, they could move the country toward a resilient, climate-focused\nagricultural sector. And in India, where up to 40 percent\nof post-harvest food is lost or wasted due to poor infrastructure, farmers have already started to implement\nsolar-powered cold storage capsules that help thousands of rural farmers\npreserve their produce and become a viable part\nof the supply chain. It will take all of these methods, from the most high-tech\nto the lowest-cost, to revolutionize farming. High-tech interventions stand to amplify climate- and conservation-oriented\napproaches to farming, and large producers will need to invest\nin implementing these technologies. Meanwhile, we'll have to expand access\nto the lower-cost methods for smaller-scale farmers. This vision of future farming\nwill also require a global shift toward more plant-based diets and huge reductions\nin food loss and waste, both of which will reduce\npressure on the land and allow farmers to do more\nwith what they have available. If we optimize food production,\nboth on land and sea, we can feed humanity within the environmental\nlimits of the earth, but there's a very small margin of error, and it will take unprecedented\nglobal cooperation and coordination of the agricultural\nlands we have today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long ago did humans begin to farm?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More than 50,000 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About 10,000 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About 800 years ago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Less than 3,000 years ago"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "True or false?

Invisible to the naked eye, organisms \ncalled microbes swarm every surface. Hordes of bacteria, archaea, and fungi \nhave evolved to produce powerful enzymes that break down tough organic material \ninto digestible nutrients. But there’s one particularly widespread \ntype of material that almost no microbes can biodegrade: plastics. To make most plastics, molecules \nfrom oil, gas and coal are refined and turned into long, repeating chains \ncalled polymers. This process often requires temperatures \nabove 100˚C, incredibly high pressure, and various chemical modifications. The resulting man-made polymers \nare quite different from the polymers found in nature. And since they’ve only been \naround since the 1950s, most microbes haven’t had time to evolve \nenzymes to digest them. Making matters even more difficult, breaking most plastics’ chemical bonds \nrequires high temperatures comparable to those used to create them— and such heat is deadly to most microbes. This means that most plastics \nnever biologically degrade— they just turn into countless, tiny, \nindigestible pieces. And pieces from the most common plastics \nlike Polyethylene, Polypropylene, and Polyester-terephthalate\nhave been piling up for decades. Each year humanity produces roughly \n400 million more tons of plastic, 80% of which is discarded as trash. Of that plastic waste, \nonly 10% is recycled. 60% gets incinerated \nor goes into the landfills, and 30% leaks out into the environment where it will pollute natural ecosystems \nfor centuries. An estimated 10 million tons of plastic \nwaste end up in the ocean each year, mostly in the form of microplastic \nfragments that pollute the food chain. Fortunately, there are microbes \nthat may be able to take a bite out of this \ngrowing problem. In 2016, a team of Japanese researchers \nsampling sludge at a plastic-bottle recycling plant \ndiscovered Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6. This never-before-identified bacterium \ncontained two enzymes capable of slowly breaking \ndown PET polymers at relatively low temperatures. Researchers isolated the genes coding \nfor these plastic-digesting enzymes, allowing other bioengineers to combine \nand improve the pair— creating super-enzymes that could break \ndown PET up to 6 times faster. Even with this boost, these lab-grown enzymes still took weeks \nto degrade a thin film of PET, and they operated best at temperatures \nbelow 40˚C. However, another group of scientists \nin Japan had been researching bacterial enzymes adapted \nto high temperature environments like compost piles. And within one particularly warm pile \nof rotting leaves and branches, they found gene sequences \nfor powerful degrading enzymes known as Leaf Branch Compost Cutinases. Using fast-growing microorganisms, other researchers were able \nto genetically engineer high quantities of these enzymes. They then enhanced and selected \nspecial variants of the Cutinases that could degrade PET plastic \nin environments reaching 70˚C— a high temperature that can weaken \nPET polymers and make them digestible. With the help of these \nand other tiny diehards, the future of PET recycling \nlooks promising. But PET is just one type of plastic. We still need ways to biologically degrade\nall the other types, including abundant PEs and PPs which only begin breaking down \nat temperatures well above 130˚C. Researchers don’t currently know \nof any microbes or enzymes tough enough to tolerate \nsuch temperatures. So for now, the main way we deal \nwith these plastics is through energy-intensive physical \nand chemical processes. Today only a small fraction \nof plasticwaste can be biologically degraded by microbes. Researchers are looking for more \nheat-tolerant plastivores in the planet’s most hostile environments and engineering better \nplastivorous enzymes in the lab. But we can’t rely solely on these tiny \nhelpers to clean up our enormous mess. We need to completely rethink \nour relationship with plastics, make better use of existing plastics, and stopproducing more of the same. And we urgently need to design more \nenvironmentally friendly types of polymers that our growing entourage of plastivores \ncan easily break down."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Plastics don’t easily break down biologically into nutrients because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Most naturally occurring microbes haven’t evolved the ability to biodegrade and compost plastics into useable nutrients."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Most plastics are made from cellulose and lignin which microbes cannot digest."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Plastic polymers require low temperatures and pressures to break down which are lethal to most biological organisms."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Plastics aren’t made from carbon chains and therefore have no nutrients to offer."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Plastics are made from long chains of hydrocarbons called polymers which are derived from:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "refined fossil-fuels such as oil and gas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cellulose and lignin molecules"}, {"label": "C", "text": "powerful enzymes known as Leaf Branch Cutinases"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bacteria like Ideonella sakaiensis"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Each year, humanity produces approximately __ million tons of plastic, discards __ millions of tons as trash and __ tons end up in the ocean.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4, 3, 1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "40, 32, 5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "400, 320, 10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4000, 3200, 100"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT true, according to the video?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Leaf Branch Cutinase was created in a laboratory from plastic waste."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Leaf Branch Cutinase was genetically engineered from the bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis, to digest PET 6 times faster than the naturally occurring Ideonella sakainensis at 30C."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Leaf Branch Cutinase was discovered in a warm compost pile and genetically engineered to degrade PET at temperatures up to 70˚C."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Leaf Branch Cutinase evolved from sludge found at a Japanese plastic-bottle recycling plant."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following are NOT true, according to the video?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The most common types of plastics are PolyEthylene (PE), PolyPropylene (PP) and PolyEsterTerephthalate (PET)."}, {"label": "B", "text": "PP and PE need temperatures above 100˚C to chemically break down their polymers."}, {"label": "C", "text": "We need to rethink our relationship with plastics and stop using long-lasting plastics for one-time uses."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Plastivorous microbes can eat all types of plastic and solve our plastic pollution problem alone."}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Historically, the union between \nShiva and Parvati was a glorious one. They maintained the equilibrium \nbetween thought and action on which the well-being \nof the world depended. Without Parvati as the agent of energy, \ngrowth, and transformation on Earth, Shiva would become a detached observer, \nand the world would remain static. But together, the two formed \na divine union known as Ardhanarishvara–– a sacred combination which brought fertility and connection \nto all living things. For these reasons, Parvati was worshipped\nfar and wide as the mother of the natural world–– and the essential counterpart \nto Shiva’s powers of raw creation. She oversaw humanity’s material comforts; and ensured that the Earth’s inhabitants\nwere bonded to each other physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Yet a rift had grown \nbetween these two formidable forces. While Parvati sustained daily life \nwith care and control, Shiva had begun to belittle \nhis wife’s essential work— and insisted on quarreling \nabout their roles in the universe. He believed that Brahma, \nthe Creator of the world, had conceived the material plane \npurely for his own fancy. And therefore, all material things \nwere merely distractions called māyā— nothing but a cosmic illusion. For millennia Parvati \nhad merely smiled knowingly as Shiva dismissed \nthe things she nurtured. But upon His latest rebuke, she knew she had to prove \nthe importance of her work once and for all. She took flight from the world, withdrawing her half of the cosmic energy\nthat kept the Earth turning. At her disappearance, a sudden, \nterrifying and all-encompassing scarcity enveloped the world in eerie silence. Without Parvati, \nthe land became dry and barren. Rivers shrank \nand crops shriveled in the fields. Hunger descended on humanity. Parents struggled to console \ntheir starving children while their own stomachs rumbled. With nothing to eat, people no longer\ngathered over heaped bowls of rice, but withdrew and shrank \nfrom the darkening world. To His shock and awe, Shiva also felt the profound emptiness\nleft by his wife’s absence. Despite His supreme power, He too realized that He was not immune\nto the need for sustenance, and His yearning felt \nbottomless and unbearable. As Shiva despaired \nover the desolate Earth, He came to realize that \nthe material world could not be so easily dismissed. At her husband’s epiphany, the compassionate Parvati \ncould no longer stand by and watch her devotees wasting away. To walk among them \nand restore their health, she took the form of a new avatar, carrying a golden bowl of porridge \nand armed with a jewel-encrusted ladle. As word of this hopeful figure spread, she was worshipped as Annapurna, \nthe Goddess of food. With the arrival of Annapurna, \nthe world blossomed anew. People rejoiced at fertility and food, \nand communed together to give thanks. Some believe that Annapurna first appeared\nin the sacred city of Kashi, or the Place of Freedom, \non the banks of the Ganges— where she opened a kitchen \nto fill the bellies of the people until they could eat no more. But it was not only mere mortals \nwho were served at her feast. Humbled at the scenes of earthly pleasure\nblooming all around him, Lord Shiva himself approached the goddess\nwith an empty bowl and begged for food and forgiveness. For this reason, the supreme deity \nis sometimes portrayed as a poor beggar at the mercy of Annapurna; holding her golden bowl in her left hand,\nwhile the right forms the abhaya mudra–– a gesture of safety and assurance. With these symbols, \nthis powerful avatar makes it clear that the material world \nis anything but an illusion. Rather, it is a cycle of life \nthat must be sustained— from the feeding of open mouths \nand rumbling bellies, to the equilibrium of the Earth."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which Goddess is known as the Goddess of Food?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Kali"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Durga"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Annapurna"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Saraswati"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who is Lord Shiva’s wife?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Radha"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lakshmi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Saraswati"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Parvati"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the divine union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shakti"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ardhanarishvara"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Linga"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Maya"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the cosmic illusion known as?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Maya"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Upanishad"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bhumi"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kaya"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who is the creator of the world in the Hindu Pantheon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shiva"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vishnu"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Brahma"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Narada"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Koehl", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-are-earthquakes-so-hard-to-predict-jean-baptiste-p-koehl", "transcript": {"en": "In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with \nhis latest invention. This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake \noccurred in their kingdom– including the direction \nthey should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered \non a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers came \nfor help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on pots to \nidentify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique\nchallenge to those trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so \nhard to anticipate, and how could we get better \nat predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories \nbehind how earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, \njagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten\nlayer of Earth’s mantle. This causes the plates to \nspread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 \ncentimeters per year. But these tiny movements are powerful \nenough to cause deep cracks in the\ninteracting plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may \nultimately trigger an earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these \nminiscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into \nseismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose \ndifferent rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker–\nunder pressure. Diverse rocks also react differently to\nfriction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release\nlubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject to \nvarying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks\nmoving throughout Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables \nshould we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our \ngrowing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur \nat largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates \nis somewhat cyclical. Today, many of our most reliable clues \ncome from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes \nhave previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions \nabout when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict \nvery loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the \nvibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts\nin the earth’s crust. And today, most smartphones are \nalso capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially \ncrowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts \npeople to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able\nto provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols. But such detailed readings \nwould still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s \nQuakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of \ngeological data to identify regions at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be\ninvisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck \nthe east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly \nhigh concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair: \nradon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right \nbefore an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases \nto escape to the surface. These scientists think that if we built \na vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising \nwarning system– potentially predicting quakes \na week in advance. Of course, none of these technologies \nwould be as helpful as simply looking deep inside \nthe earth itself. With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale \ngeological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands \nof lives a year. But for now, these technologies can help us prepare \nand respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions \nfrom a vase."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What method was first used to predict earthquakes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Potassium–Argon (40K–39Ar)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Radon–Thoron (222Rn–220Rn)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Zhang Heng’s seismoscope"}, {"label": "D", "text": "NASA’s Quakesim software"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the name of the instrument used to record seismic waves generated by earthquakes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A seismoscope"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A seismogram"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A seismometer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A seismologist"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How fast do tectonic plates move?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As quickly as human nails grow"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1–20 meters per year"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1–20 centimeters per day"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1–20 micrometers per year"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which method is now considered the most promising for earthquake prediction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Potassium–Argon (40K–39Ar)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Radon–Thoron (222Rn–220Rn)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Zhang Heng’s seismoscope"}, {"label": "D", "text": "NASA’s Quakesim software"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How long in advance could the Radon–Thoron method predict earthquakes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "7 minutes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "7 hours"}, {"label": "C", "text": "7 days"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7 weeks"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

The titanic waves flooded \nthe Dutch coastline, killing almost 2,000 people. 54 years later, a similar storm \nthreatened the region. But this time, the Netherlands \nwere ready. As the water swelled, state-of-the-art computer sensors \nactivated emergency protocols. Over the next 30 minutes, a pair of 240-meter steel arms \nswung shut, protecting the channel ahead. Using 680-tonne ball joints, the barrier moved in rhythm \nwith the shifting wind and waves. By morning, the storm had passed \nwith minimal flooding. The first field activation \nof the Maeslantkering had been a resounding success. As one of the planet’s largest mobile \nstructures, this storm surge barrier \nis a marvel of human engineering. But the Maeslantkering is just one part\nof a massive, interlocking system of water controls \nknown as the Delta Works— the most sophisticated flood prevention \nproject in the world. The Netherlands has a long history \nwith water management. The country lies along the delta \nof three major European rivers, and nearly a quarter of its territory \nis below sea level. This geography makes the region \nextremely prone to flooding. So much so, that some of the earliest \nDutch governing bodies were informal “water boards” that \ncoordinated flood protection projects. But after the storms of 1953, the Dutch\ngovernment took more official measures. They established the Delta Commission, and tasked them with protecting \nthe entire southwestern region. Focusing on densely populated cities, their aim was to reduce the annual odds \nof flooding below 1 in 10,000— about 100 times as safe\nas the average coastal city. Accomplishing this lofty goal required\nvarious infrastructure projects along the southwestern coast. The first line of defense was to dam \nthe region’s flood-prone estuaries. These large inlets fed many of \nthe country’s rivers into the North Sea, and during storms they allowed \nflood water to surge inland. Using a series of dams, the Delta \nCommission transformed these estuaries into expansive lakes that serve \nas nature preserves and community parks. However, this solution wouldn’t work \nfor the Nieuwe Waterweg. As the lifeblood of the local shipping \nindustry, this passage had to be kept open \nin safe conditions, and barricaded during storm surges. In 1998, the completed Maeslantkering provided the flexible \nprotection necessary. Alongside additional barriers, \nlike grassy dikes and concrete seawalls, these fortifications made up the bulk \nof the Delta Works project, which was primarily focused on \nholding back ocean storms. But in the following decades, \nthe Dutch pursued additional plans to complement the Delta Works \nand protect against floods further inland. Under the \"Room for the River\" plan, farms and dikes were relocated \naway from the shore. This left more space for water \nto collect in low-lying floodplains, creating reservoirs and habitats \nfor local wildlife. This strategic retreat not only \ndecreased flood risk, but allowed for the redeveloped \nsettlements to be built more densely and sustainably. Perhaps no city embodies the Netherlands' \nmulti-pronged approach to water management as much as Rotterdam, a thriving city \nalmost entirely below sea level. When a storm threatens, densely populated older districts \nare protected by traditional dikes. Meanwhile, newer districts \nhave been artificially elevated, often sporting green roofs \nthat store rainwater. Numerous structures around the city \ntransform into water storage facilities, including parking garages and plazas which normally serve as theaters \nand sports arenas. Meanwhile in the harbor, floating \npavilions rise with the water level. These are the first of several planned \namphibious structures, some of which house water purification\nsystems and solar collectors. These strategies are just some \nof the technologies and policies that have put the Netherlands \nat the cutting edge of water management. The country continues to find new ways \nto make cities more resilient to natural disasters. And as the rising sea levels \ncaused by climate change threaten low-lying cities \nacross the world, the Netherlands offers an exceptional \nexample of how to go with the flow."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long are each of the two steel arms of the Maeslantkering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50 meter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "120 meter"}, {"label": "C", "text": "240 meter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "400 meter"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many years did it take from the creation of the Delta Commission to the construction completion of the Maeslantkering?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "44 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "27 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5 years"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the annual odds of flooding of densely populated cities in the Netherlands", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 in 100"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1 in 1,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 in 10,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1 in 100,000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "About how much of the Netherlands’ territory lies below sea level?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "25%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "75%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is NOT a flood prevention measure?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A storm surge barrier"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A dike"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Artificially-elevated land"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A ball joint"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

With his vast armies he became almost \nunstoppable. But, legend has it that there was \none obstacle that even the impressive Khan couldn’t \novercome: A towering wall of ice, grown by locals across a mountain pass to stop the Khan’s armies from \ninvading their territory. No one knows how historically accurate \nthat particular story is, but remarkably, it draws on fact: For centuries, in the Karakoram \nand Himalayan mountain ranges, people have been growing glaciers \nand using these homemade bodies of ice as sources of drinking water and \nirrigation for their crops. But before we get to that fascinating \nphenomenon, it’s important to understand the \ndifference between glaciers that grow in the wild, and those that humans create. In the wild, glaciers require three conditions to grow: Snowfall, cold temperatures, and time. First, a great deal of snow falls and \naccumulates. Cold temperatures then ensure that the \nstacked up snow persists throughout the winter, spring, \nsummer, and fall. Over the following years, decades, \nand centuries, the pressure of the accumulated snow transforms layers into highly compacted \nglacial ice. Artificially growing a glacier, however, is completely different. At the confluence of three great \nmountain ranges, the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, some local cultures have believed for\ncenturies that glaciers are alive. And what’s more, that certain glaciers can have different \ngenders including male and female. Local Glacier Growers ‘breed’ new glaciers\nby grafting together—or marrying— fragments of ice from male and \nfemale glaciers, then covering them with charcoal, \nwheat husks, cloths, or willow branches so they can reproduce. Under their protective coverings, these glacierets transform into fully \nactive glaciers that grow each year with \nadditional snowfall. Those then serve as lasting \nreserves of water that farmers can use \nto irrigate their crops. These practices have spread \nto other cultures, where people are creating their own \nversions of glaciers and applying them to solve serious \nmodern challenges around water supplies. Take Ladakh, a high-altitude desert region\nin northern India. It sits in the rain shadow of the \nHimalayas and receives on average fewer than ten \ncentimeters of rain per year. As local glaciers shrink because \nof climate change, regional water scarcity is increasing. And so, local people have started growing \ntheir own glaciers as insurance against this uncertainty. These glaciers come in two types: \nhorizontal, and vertical. Horizontal glaciers are formed when \nfarmers redirect glacier meltwater into channels and pipes, then carefully siphon it off into a series\nof basins made from stones and earth. Villagers minutely control the release of \nwater into these reservoirs, waiting for each new layer to freeze before filling the basin \nwith another wave. In early spring, these frozen pools begin to melt, supplying villagers with \nirrigation for their fields. Local people make vertical glaciers using \nthe meltwater from already-existing glaciers \nhigh above their villages. The meltwater enters channels \nthat run downhill, flowing until it reaches a crop site where it bursts forth from a pipe pointing\nstraight into the air. When winter temperatures dip, this water freezes as it arcs \nout of the pipe, ultimately forming a 50 meter ice \nsculpture called a stupa, shaped like an upside-down ice cream cone. This inverted form minimizes the amount\nof surface area it exposes to the sun in the spring and summer. That ensures that the mini-glacier \nmelts slowly and provides a reliable supply of water \nto feed the farmers’ crops. These methods may be ancient, but they’re becoming more relevant as climate change takes its \ntoll on our planet. In fact, people are now growing their own\nglaciers in many regions beyond Ladakh. Swiss people, utilizing modern glacier \ngrowing technology, created their first stupa in 2016 \nin the Swiss Alps. There are plans for over 100 more in \nvillages in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Perhaps one day we’ll be able to harness\nour homegrown glaciers well enough to build whole walls of ice– this time not for keeping people out, but to enable life in some of the planet’s\nharshest landscapes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where can you find glaciers on this planet?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In the Arctic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the Arctic and Antarctica"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the Arctic, Antarctica, and Asia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In the Arctic, Antarctica, Asia, and Africa"}, {"label": "E", "text": "In the Arctic, Antarctica, Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas."}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What are three basic conditions needed for glaciers to grow?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cold temperatures, mountains, and rain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cold temperatures, time, and snow"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mild temperatures, high elevation, time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mild temperatures, low elevation, snow"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why did people start growing their own glaciers?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To control mountains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because glaciers are beautiful"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To provide water for their crops"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because glaciers are melting"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why are wild glaciers shrinking?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because of more people living near glaciers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because of Genghis Khan’s raiders"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because of colder weather"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because of increasing climatic changes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are the two types of artificial glaciers people grow today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wild and domesticated glaciers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Horizontal and vertical glaciers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tall and short glaciers"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

If you’ve seen the images of plastic bags\nstrewn across the ocean, it might seem obvious that plastic \nis bad for the environment. Surely a paper bag or a cotton tote\nwould be the better option. But is that really true? Each of these three materials \nhas a unique environmental impact that’s determined by its carbon footprint, its potential to be reused and recycled,\nand its degradability. So, to get the full story \non these grocery bags we need to look at how they’re made, how they’re used, \nand where they ultimately go. Let’s start with plastic. The typical thin and flimsy plastic bag \nis made of high-density polyethylene, commonly known as HDPE. Producing this material requires\nextracting petroleum from the ground and applying extreme heat. The resulting polymer resin \nis then transported alongside additional ingredients \nlike titanium oxide and chalk to a bag manufacturing plant. Here, coal powered machines \nmelt the materials down and spin them into sheets of plastic, which are then folded into bags. By the time a bag reaches\nits final destination, it’s contributed an estimated 1.6 kg\nof carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. That’s the same amount of carbon\na car produces, driving a little over 6 kilometers. But the alternatives actually possess\na much larger carbon footprint. Paper is made from wood pulp, and when you account for the carbon cost\nof removing trees from their ecosystems, a single paper bag can be responsible\nfor about 5.5 kg of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, growing cotton is an extremely\nenergy and water intensive process. The production of a single cotton tote emits an estimated 272 kg\nof carbon dioxide. When we compare carbon footprints,\nplastic bags are the clear winner. But environmental impact \nis also determined by how the bag is used. Reusing or recycling these bags significantly offsets \ntheir environmental toll by reducing demand for new production. To quantify that offset, we can divide\nthe bag’s carbon footprint by the number of times it’s reused. For example, if a typical paper bag \nis reused three times, it has a lower net impact \nthan a single-use plastic bag. The carbon footprint of a cotton tote\ncan similarly be lowered, if it’s reused 131 times. Of these three options, durable cloth\ntotes are most likely to be reused. Evidence shows paper bags are quickly\ndiscarded due to their tendency to tear. This issue plagues HDPE\nplastic bags as well. But even when they’re made \nto avoid tearing, their widespread availability makes\nit easy to treat them as single-use items. Fortunately, researchers estimate\nthat 40% of HDPE bags are reused at least once\nfor throwing out waste. Recycling these bags also offsets \ntheir carbon footprint, but it’s not universally possible \nfor each material. Many countries lack the infrastructure\nto efficiently recycle plastic bags. Cotton totes are perhaps even more\ndifficult to breakdown and process, but since they’re often reused \nfor long periods, they’re still least likely \nto end up in landfills. Whenever these bags aren’t recycled, the third factor in calculating\nenvironmental impact comes into play: degradability. Since HDPE bags are heat-resistant\nand insoluble, they stick around long after we’re done\nwith them. Partially broken down plastic \ncan circulate in ecosystems for centuries. Cotton on the other hand degrades\nsubstantially in a matter of months, and paper bags break down \ncompletely in just 90 days. So, which bag should you use? It turns out the most \nenvironmentally friendly bags have features of several materials\nwe've discussed. They’re durable and reusable, like cotton,\nbut made of plastic, which has a lower carbon footprint\nthan cotton or paper. These sturdy shopping bags consist of\npolyester, vinyl and other tough plastics, and are already used worldwide.

But their laughter froze when they heard\nthe Gestapo pounding on Sendler’s door. Sendler rushed to the window to dispose\nof incriminating evidence— only to see more police patrolling below. Knowing she was minutes from arrest, she tossed Janina \nher most dangerous possession: a glass jar containing the names \nof over 2,000 Jewish children she’d smuggled to safety. This arrest wasn’t the first consequence \nSendler had faced in her lifelong crusade\nagainst anti-Semitism. Born to Catholic parents in 1910,\nshe grew up in a predominantly Jewish town where her father treated poor Jewish \npatients other doctors refused to help. Irena was furious at the constant\ndiscrimination against her Jewish friends. As a graduate student in social welfare\nat the University of Warsaw, Sendler publicly denounced \nthe segregation of classrooms and defaced her non-Jewish identity card— earning her a suspension and a reputation\nfor troublemaking. Buoyed by her socialist ideals \nand inspired by her fellow social workers, Sendler assisted vulnerable Jewish\nfamilies across Warsaw, pushing back on the waves of anti-Semitism\nsurging through Europe. But in September 1939, \nNazi Germany invaded Poland, bringing laws that further\neroded Jewish rights. In 1940, Hitler announced that hundreds\nof thousands of Jews in Warsaw were to be forced into just \nover one square mile of land. Bordered by high walls and subject \nto constant surveillance, families living in the Warsaw Ghetto\nquickly became starving and sick. Appalled, Sendler and her colleagues\nsecured passes to the ghetto on the pretense of checking\nfor typhus outbreaks. At first, her group worked \nto smuggle in resources with the help of sympathetic Polish \nofficials and the medical underground. But as desperate parents began sending\ntheir children through sewers and over walls, it became clear that\nto help these people survive, Sendler needed to help them escape. Sendler and her associates developed \na coordinated campaign of rescue missions. Children were bundled into dirty laundry,\npacked into boxes on cargo trains, and carried beneath the Gestapo’s noses \nin coffins, toolboxes, and briefcases. Bigger children escaped \nthrough the courthouse and church, which straddled the ghetto’s boundaries. Sendler helped ferry these children \nto safe houses, before forging them new documents \nand sending them to orphanages, convents, and foster families\nacross Poland. To retain their Jewish identities\nand keep track of every child, Sendler kept painstaking records\non thin cigarette paper and stored them in glass jars. This work was punishable by death. But for Sendler, such consequences\npaled in comparison to the pain of convincing parents\nto part with their children— often with no promise of a reunion. In 1942, the Nazis began transporting \nJews from the ghetto into concentration camps. Sendler worked with new urgency, joining forces with the Nazi\nresistance group called Zegota. Zegota helped Sendler expand her\noperation by stashing money for her in post boxes across Warsaw. But this system would also be \nSendler’s downfall. When the Gestapo threatened a laundry\nowner whose business contained a Zegota post box, she gave them Sendler’s name. At 3am on October 20th, the \nGestapo burst into Sendler’s apartment, arresting her for aiding Jews\nthroughout the country. The police had captured Sendler,\nbut her records remained safe.

{"page": 78, "lesson": 17, "title": "The wicked wit of Jane Austen - Iseult Gillespie", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-wicked-wit-of-jane-austen-iseult-gillespie", "transcript": {"en": "Whether she’s describing \nbickering families, quiet declarations of love, or juicy gossip, Jane Austen’s writing often feels as \nthough it was written just for you. Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness \ninforms her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers\nwith a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers \nfeel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully \nwicked friend Jane. But this unique brand of \ntongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found \nin her sly satires of society, civility, \nand sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode \nthe sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering \ncollision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common \nthread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style \nof writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally, \nand often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice, \nfriendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs \nabout their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules \nof their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety, \nand small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes \nto his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, \nbut to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule \nsenseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical \nimportance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial \nnecessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between\nthe mythical quest for love, and the economic benefits \nof making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums \nthis up in \"Mansfield Park;\" “I would have everybody marry \nif they can do it properly: I do not like to have people \nthrow themselves away.” Unsurprisingly, these themes were also \npresent in Austen’s personal life. Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles \nfound in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education, and provided space for her to write \nand publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found\nin many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty, \npragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. These headstrong heroines provide \nan entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet \nof \"Pride and Prejudice,\" whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives \nblinds her to a clumsy suitor. Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot \nof \"Persuasion,\" who chooses to remain unmarried \nafter the disappearance of her first love. And Elinor Dashwood, who fiercely protects her family \nat the cost of her own desires in \"Sense and Sensibility.\" These women all encounter \ndifficult choices about romantic, filial, and \nfinancial stability, and they resolve them without \nsacrificing their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters \nare far from perfect. They often think they have \nall the answers. And by telling the story \nfrom their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing \ntheir heroine knows best– only to pull the rug out from under \nthe protagonist and the reader. In \"Emma,\" the titular character feels \nsurrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope \nto match her wit. As her guests prattle on and \non about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is the only exciting character \nin this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control \nas she thinks – in life or love. And Austen’s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing \nher host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the \ninconsistency of all human characters.” Their complexity has kept Austen \nprominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable \nfor modern sensibilities. So hopefully, new readers will continue \nto find a friend in Ms. Austen for many years to come."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Jane Austen’s novels were written in the ___ century, and center on the lives of the ____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eighteenth century; British upper classes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nineteenth century; British upper classes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nineteenth century; British working classes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eighteenth century; American upper classes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Jane Austen's work can be classified as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Romance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Satire"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sentimental"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Horror"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Romance and Satire"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "One of the reasons her characters remain so beloved is because of their:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Awkwardness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Humor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mischief"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In Austen’s day, a woman was under no obligation to marry for financial reasons.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The heroine of Pride and Prejudice is named:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Anne Elliot"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elizabeth Bennet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ellinor Dashwood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Emma Woodhouse"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

She had been imprisoned for her activities\nas an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and \ntwo other prisoners, she was back under the Parisian stars. As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind \nof events that had brought her here… Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian \nMuslim father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly \npeaceful home. Her parents were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of \nmusic and compassion. They moved to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology \nand published children’s books. But all this changed with the advent \nof the Second World War. In May 1940, with the German army \nready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced \nwith a difficult choice. As pacifists, they believed that all \ndisputes should be settled non-violently. But witnessing the devastation \nacross Europe, they decided that standing on the \nsidelines was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s \nAuxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator. She immersed herself in wireless \noperations and Morse code– unaware that she was being monitored \nby a secret organization. The British Special Operations Executive \nwas established to sabotage the Germans \nin Nazi-occupied countries. As a trained radio operator who knew \nParis well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit. In her interview, she was warned that \nwireless operation was some of the most dangerous work \nin the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous \ntransmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t \nprotect her if she was caught. Noor accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her \npacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to contact intelligence \nnetworks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June 1943 she landed \nin Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed \nwith a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, \nand Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors \nto let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio \noperators singlehandedly. Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies \nto the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back \nto London and arranged safe passage \nfor allied soldiers. This work was essential to building the \nFrench resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick \nthinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way \nout of questioning. When the Gestapo searched \nher on the train, she gave them a casual tour \nof her “film projector.” When an officer spotted \nher hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for \nlistening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping \nher set up the cable. In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth \nnever failed her. But her charm had inspired \nlethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister \nof a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away \nfrom the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight \nand slip out into the night. But just as the prisoners began \nto run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was caught once again \nand sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration camp. Despite being tortured, \ndeprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who \nwaged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom \nwithout ever taking a life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many women were sent to France by the SOE?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ten"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fifteen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thirty-nine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Forty-five"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these agents was awarded the George Cross?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nancy Wake"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Virginia Hall"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eileen Nearne"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Noor Inayat Khan"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How old was Noor Inayat Khan when she died?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30"}, {"label": "C", "text": "21"}, {"label": "D", "text": "32"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Where was Noor Inayat Khan born?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "India"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Russia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "France"}, {"label": "D", "text": "England"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Where was Noor Inayat Khan killed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ravenscroft"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fresnes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dachau"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Auschwitz"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Guerra", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/rosalind-franklin-dna-s-unsung-hero-claudio-l-guerra", "transcript": {"en": "The discovery of the structure of DNA was one of the most important scientific\nachievements in the last century, in human history, in fact. The now-famous double helix is almost\nsynonymous with Watson and Crick, two of the scientists who won\nthe Nobel Prize for figuring it out. But there's another name \nyou may know, too, Rosalind Franklin. You may have heard that her data supported\nWatson and Crick's brilliant idea, or that she was a plain-dressing,\nbelligerent scientist, which is how Watson actually described her\nin \"The Double Helix.\" But thanks to Franklin's biographers, who investigated her life \nand interviewed many people close to her, we now know that that account\nis far from true, and her scientific contributions\nhave been vastly underplayed. Let's hear the real story. Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born\nin London in 1920. She wanted to be a scientist ever\nsince she was a teenager, which wasn't a common or easy\ncareer path for girls at that time. But she excelled at science anyway. She won a scholarship to Cambridge\nto study chemistry, where she earned her Ph.D., and she later conducted research on\nthe structure of coal that led to better gas masks for \nthe British during World War II. In 1951, she joined King's College to use x-ray techniques to study\nthe structure of DNA, then one of the hottest topics in science. Franklin upgraded the x-ray lab\nand got to work shining high-energy x-rays \non tiny, wet crystals of DNA. But the acadmemic culture at the time\nwasn't very friendly to women, and Franklin was isolated \nfrom her colleagues. She clashed with Maurice Wilkins, a labmate who assumed Franklin\nhad been hired as his assistant. But Franklin kept working, and in 1952, she obtained Photo 51,\nthe most famous x-ray image of DNA. Just getting the image took 100 hours, the calculations necessary to analyze it\nwould take a year. Meanwhile, the American biologist\nJames Watson and the British physicist Francis Crick were also working \non finding DNA's structure. Without Franklin's knowledge, Wilkins took Photo 51\nand showed it to Watson and Crick. Instead of calculating the exact\nposition of every atom, they did a quick analysis \nof Franklin's data and used that to build \na few potential structures. Eventually, they arrived at the right one. DNA is made of two helicoidal strands, one opposite the other with bases\nin the center like rungs of a ladder. Watson and Crick published their model\nin April 1953. Meanwhile, \nFranklin had finished her calculations, come to the same conclusion, and submitted her own manuscript. The journal published \nthe manuscripts together, but put Franklin's last, making it look like her experiments just\nconfirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough instead of inspiring it. But Franklin had already \nstopped working on DNA and died of cancer in 1958, never knowing that Watson and Crick\nhad seen her photographs. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won\nthe Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA. It's often said that Franklin would have\nbeen recognized by a Nobel Prize if only they could be \nawarded posthumously. And, in fact, it's possible \nshe could have won twice. Her work on the structure of viruses\nled to a Nobel for a colleague in 1982. It's time to tell the story of a brave\nwoman who fought sexism in science, and whose work revolutionized\nmedicine, biology, and agriculture.

Three sisters would go on to lead \nan underground revolution. But while their courage inspired many,\nit threatened the man in power, and their lives would come \nto a tragic early end. Trujillo rose through the military ranks \nduring the United States’ occupation of the Dominican Republic. He assumed power in 1930 through a coup\nand rigged election and created a system that enriched \nhimself and his allies. Trujillo’s family alone \ncontrolled three-fifths of the country’s gross domestic product, including monopolies \nover salt, beef, and newspapers. He renamed the country's\ncapital after himself and expected his portrait to be\ndisplayed in every household. And he committed atrocities, including \nthe massacre of thousands of Haitians. All the while, a secret police force\nmaintained his power by targeting opponents at home and abroad. The Mirabal sisters grew up in a middle\nclass family in the countryside. Their parents sent the four sisters— Patria, Dedé, Minerva, and María Teresa— to one of the country’s \nbest boarding schools. There, Minerva met a classmate whose\nrelative was killed on Trujillo's orders. She began seeking out strong\nvoices of opposition and discussing issues of oppression\nand justice with her sisters. While Dedé stayed out of politics, Minerva, Patria, and María Teresa became\ninvested in changing their country. However, the Mirabal family’s \nsafe standing soon collapsed. In 1949, they were invited \nto one of Trujillo’s parties, which served as his personal hunting\ngrounds for young women. Declining the invitation\nwas not an option. Despite Minerva’s attempts \nto avoid him at the reception, she eventually danced with Trujillo\nbut rejected his advances. The Mirabal family left the party early, which was seldom done and considered\ndisrespectful to the dictator. Their father, Enrique, was imprisoned\nand family property was confiscated. Minerva graduated with highest honors as one of the first women in the country \nto receive a law degree. But she was denied state authorization\nto practice— a process Trujillo oversaw. While studying, Minerva met \nManolo Tavárez Justo. He shared her political convictions\nand the two married in 1955. They watched as armed revolutions launched\nthroughout Latin America. After Trujillo crushed an attempt\nto overthrow him in 1959, they began to prepare a revolution\nof their own. The Mirabal sisters and their husbands\nformed the June 14th movement along with many others \nfrom the middle class. Codenamed Las Mariposas, \nor the Butterflies, the three sisters organized \nand attended clandestine meetings and distributed pamphlets detailing\nTrujillo’s violations. In January of 1960, they called representatives together \nfrom all over the country to establish the movement’s structure \nand prepare an uprising. But it was not to be. Trujillo had spies everywhere. Soon, many revolutionaries, including\nMinerva and María Teresa, were arrested. During this time, Patria found creative\nways of transmitting information to and from imprisoned rebels. Fearful of losing the support\nof the U.S. and the Church, which had recently begun to criticize him, Trujillo released the sisters while\nleaving their husbands imprisoned. But they continued to threaten \nhis regime’s stability— and his ego. On November 25th, as the three sisters were returning from \nvisiting two of their imprisoned husbands, Trujillo’s men stopped their car. The sisters, along with their driver,\nRufino de la Cruz, were asphyxiated and beaten to death. The men rolled the Jeep off a hill \nto frame the murder as a car accident. Patria was 36, Minerva was 33,\nand María Teresa was 25. But Trujillo's plan to silence\nthe Mirabal sisters and stabilize his regime \nbackfired. Much of the public wasn’t fooled\nby the flimsy coverup. The international community condemned\nthe assassination. And the U.S. closed its Dominican embassy and secretly invested \nin the anti-Trujillo movement. Months later, former members \nof the Dominican military killed the dictator, bringing his violent,\n31-year reign to an end. Thanks to their family, especially\ntheir surviving sister, Dedé, the legacy of the Mirabal sisters would \nsurpass the clutches of Trujillo’s tyranny even long after their deaths. Today, the Mirabal sisters\nare national heroes with monuments and honors \ncommemorating their struggle.
