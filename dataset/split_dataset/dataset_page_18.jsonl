But around 800 BCE, that began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing \nsocial upheaval and an economic crisis— what we would call a recession today. What causes recessions? This question has long been the subject \nof heated debate among economists, and for good reason. A recession can be a mild decline in \neconomic activity in a single country that lasts months, a long-lasting downturn with global \nramifications that last years, or anything in between. Complicating matters further, there are countless variables that \ncontribute to an economy’s health, making it difficult to pinpoint \nspecific causes. So it helps to start with the big picture: recessions occur when there is a negative \ndisruption to the balance between supply and demand. There’s a mismatch between how many \ngoods people want to buy, how many products and services producers \ncan offer, and the price of the goods and services \nsold, which prompts an economic decline. An economy’s relationship between supply \nand demand is reflected in its inflation rates \nand interest rates. Inflation happens when goods and services \nget more expensive. Put another way, the value \nof money decreases. Still, inflation isn’t necessarily \na bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought \nto encourage economic activity. But high inflation that isn’t accompanied \nwith high demand can both cause problems for an economy \nand eventually lead to a recession. Interest rates, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for \nindividuals and companies. The rate is typically an annual percentage\nof a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors \nuntil the loan is repaid. Low interest rates mean that companies \ncan afford to borrow more money, which they can use to invest \nin more projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase \ncosts for producers and consumers, slowing economic activity. Fluctuations in inflation and interest \nrates can give us insight into the health \nof the economy, but what causes these fluctuations \nin the first place? The most obvious causes are shocks \nlike natural disaster, war, and geopolitical factors. An earthquake, for example, can destroy the infrastructure needed to \nproduce important commodities such as oil. That forces the supply side of the economy\nto charge more for products that use oil, discouraging demand and potentially \nprompting a recession. But some recessions occur in times of \neconomic prosperity— possibly even because \nof economic prosperity. Some economists believe that business \nactivity from a market’s expansion can occasionally reach \nan unsustainable level. For example, corporations and consumers \nmay borrow more money with the assumption that economic growth \nwill help them handle the added burden. But if the economy doesn’t grow as \nquickly as expected, they may end up with more debt \nthan they can manage. To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect \nfunds from other activities, reducing business activity. Psychology can also contribute \nto a recession. Fear of a recession can become a \nself-fulfilling prophecy if it causes people to pull back investing\nand spending. In response, producers might \ncut operating costs to help weather the expected \ndecline in demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost \ncuts eventually lower wages, leading to even lower demand. Even policy designed to help prevent \nrecessions can contribute. When times are tough, governments and \ncentral banks may print money, increase spending, and lower central bank\ninterest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their \ninterest rates, effectively making debt “cheaper” \nto boost spending. But these policies are not sustainable \nand eventually need to be reversed to prevent excessive inflation. That can cause a recession if people have \nbecome too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus. The Bronze recession in Britain eventually\nended when the adoption of iron helped revolutionize farming \nand food production. Modern markets are more complex, making today’s recessions far \nmore difficult to navigate. But each recession provides new data to \nhelp anticipate and respond to future recessions more effectively."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following may directly cause a recession?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "governments reducing taxes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "central bank lowering interest rates"}, {"label": "C", "text": "governments lowering spending"}, {"label": "D", "text": "central banks increasing money supply by 1%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If interest rates are high, companies will:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "spend less"}, {"label": "B", "text": "invest more"}, {"label": "C", "text": "hire more employees"}, {"label": "D", "text": "pursue more projects"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following would not be impacted (directly) by a recession?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "inflation rate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "interest rates"}, {"label": "C", "text": "unemployment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all stated factors are affected"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which is not an example of a shock that can prompt a recession?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "earthquake"}, {"label": "B", "text": "regulation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "technological innovation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "inflation"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What ended the bronze age recession in Britain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the establishment of a central bank"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the adoption of iron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "war"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the adoption of fiat currency"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 18, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why should you read Dante’s “Divine Comedy”? - Sheila Marie Orfano", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-dante-s-divine-comedy-sheila-marie-orfano", "transcript": {"en": "“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here… ” Inscribed above the Gate of Hell, these ominous words warn dark \ntidings for Dante as he begins his descent into inferno. Yet despite the grim tone, this prophecy sets into motion what is \nperhaps the greatest love story ever told; an epic journey that encompasses both \nthe human and the divine. But for Dante to reach \nbenevolent salvation, he must first find his way through Hell. This landscape of torture is the setting \nfor \"Inferno,\" the first in a three-part narrative poem written by Dante Alighieri \nin the 14th century. Casting himself as the protagonist, Dante travels deeper and deeper \ninto Hell’s abyss, witnessing obscene punishments distinct \nto each of its nine realms. Beginning in Limbo, he travels through the\ncircles of Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Heresy, Violence, and Fraud, to the horrific ninth circle of Treachery, where sinners are trapped under the \nwatchful eyes of Satan himself. The following two parts, \"Purgatorio\" and \n\"Paradiso,\" continue Dante’s journey, as he scales the Mount of Purgatory and ascends the nine celestial \nspheres of Heaven. Written together over 10 years, these \n3 sections comprise the \"Divine Comedy\"– an allegorical imagining of the soul’s \njourney towards God. But Dante’s \"Divine Comedy\" is more than \njust religious allegory. It’s also a witty, scathing commentary on \nItalian politics. A soldier and statesman from Florence, \nDante was staunchly faithful to God, but often critical of the \nRoman Catholic Church. He particularly disliked its rampant \nnepotism and practice of simony, the buying and selling of religious \nfavours such as pardons from sin. Many groups took advantage of these \ncorrupt customs, but few supported them as much as the \nGuelfi Neri, or Black Guelphs. This was a political and religious faction which sought to expand the pope’s \npolitical influence. Dante was a member of the Guelfi Bianchi, \nor White Guelphs– who believed Florence needed more \nfreedom from Roman influence. As a public representative for the \nWhite Guelphs, Dante frequently spoke out against \nthe pope’s power, until the Black Guelphs leveraged their\nposition to exile him from Florence in 1302. But rather than silencing him, this lifelong exile led to Dante’s \ngreatest critique of all. Dishonored and with little hope of return, the author freely aired his grievances \nwith the Church and Italian society. Writing the \"Divine Comedy\" in Italian, rather than the traditional Latin of the \neducated elite, Dante ensured the widest possible audience\nfor his biting political commentary. In the \"Inferno’s\" circle of the Wrathful, Dante eagerly witnesses sinners tear Black Guelph Filippo \nArgenti limb from limb. In the circle of Fraud, Dante converses with a mysterious sinner \nburning in the circle’s hottest flames. He learns that this is Pope Nicholas III, who tells Dante that his two successors \nwill take his place when they die— all three guilty of simony and corruption. Despite the bleak and sometimes violent \nimagery in \"Inferno,\" the \"Divine Comedy\" is also a love story. Though Dante had an arranged marriage with the daughter of a powerful \nFlorentine family, he had also been unrequitedly in love with\nanother woman since he was nine years old: Beatrice Portinari. Despite allegedly meeting just twice, \nshe became Dante’s lifelong muse, serving as the inspiration and subject for\nmany of his works. In fact, it’s Beatrice who launches his \nintrepid journey into the pits of Hell and up the terraces of Mount Purgatory. Portrayed as a powerful, heavenly figure, she leads Dante through \"Paradiso’s\"\nconcentric spheres of Heaven until he is finally face-to-face with God. In the centuries since its publication, the \"Divine Comedy’s\" themes of love, \nsin, and redemption have been embraced by numerous artists– from Auguste Rodin and Salvador Dali, \nto Ezra Pound and Neil Gaiman. And the poet himself received his own \nbelated, earthly redemption in 2008, when the city of Florence finally revoked \nDante’s antiquated exile."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is inscribed above the Gate of Hell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "“Turn back, or ye will cease to live”"}, {"label": "B", "text": "“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "“Beware the wrath of hell fire”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "“Behold the sinful and where they perish”"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which is not one of the nine circles of Hell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heresy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sloth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gluttony"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lust"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which political party was Dante affiliated with?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "White Guelphs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Black Guelphs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Whigs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Romantics"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "At what age did Dante fall in love with Beatrice Portinari, his lifelong muse?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Three"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Twelve"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Seventeen"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In what language did Dante write the Divine Comedy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Greek"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Latin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Italian"}, {"label": "D", "text": "English"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

After receiving his ornate \ncrown and scepter, Henry Christophe ascended his throne, \ntowering 20 meters in the air. But little did the cheering onlookers \nknow that the first king of Haiti would also be its last. Enslaved at birth on the \nisland of Grenada, Christophe spent his childhood being \nmoved between multiple Caribbean islands. Just 12 years old in 1779, he accompanied his master to aid the \nAmerican revolutionaries in the Battle of Savannah. This prolonged siege would be Christophe’s\nfirst encounter with violent revolution. There are few surviving written records about Christophe’s life immediately \nafter the war. Over the next decade, we know he worked as a mason \nand a waiter at a hotel in the French colony of Saint-Domingue, \nas Haiti was then known. In 1791, when the colony’s \nslaves rose up in rebellion, Christophe got another opportunity \nto fight for freedom. Led by Toussaint Louverture, the rebels \nfought against plantation owners, as well as British and Spanish forces \nseeking control of the island. Christophe quickly rose \nthrough the ranks, proving himself the equal of more \nexperienced generals. By 1793, Louverture had successfully liberated \nall of Saint-Domingue’s enslaved people, and by 1801 he’d established the \nisland as a semi-autonomous colony. But during this time, Napoleon Bonaparte \nhad assumed power in France, and made it his mission to restore \nslavery and French authority throughout the empire. French attempts to reinstate slavery \nmet fierce resistance, with General Christophe even \nburning the capital city to prevent military occupation. Finally, the rebellion and an \noutbreak of yellow fever forced French soldiers to withdraw— \nbut the fight was not without casualties. Louverture was captured, \nand left to die in a French prison; a fate that Christophe’s nine-year-old son\nwould share only a few years later. Following the revolution, Christophe and generals Jean-Jacques \nDessalines and Alexandre Pétion rose to prominent positions \nin the new government. In 1804, Dessalines was proclaimed \nthe emperor of independent Haiti. But his desire to hold exclusive power \nalienated his supporters. Eventually, Dessalines’ rule incited \na political conspiracy that ended in his assassination in 1806. The subsequent power struggle led to a \nCivil War, which split the country in two. By 1807, Christophe was governing as \npresident of the north in Cap-Haïtien, and Pétion was ruling the south \nfrom Port-au-Prince. Pétion tried to stay true to the \nrevolution’s democratic roots by modeling his republic after \nthe United States. He even supported anti-colonial \nrevolutionaries in other nations. These policies endeared \nhim to his people, but they slowed trade and economic growth. Christophe, conversely, had more \naggressive plans for an independent Haiti. He redistributed land to the people, while\nretaining state control of agriculture. He also established trade with \nmany foreign nations, including Great Britain and \nthe United States, and pledged non-interference \nwith their foreign policies. He even built a massive Citadel in case \nthe French tried to invade again. To accomplish all of this, Christophe \ninstituted mandatory labor, and to strengthen his authority, \nhe crowned himself king in 1811. During his reign, he lived in an \nelegant palace called Sans Souci along with his wife and their \nthree remaining children. Christophe’s kingdom oversaw rapid \ndevelopment of trade, industry, culture, and education. He imported renowned European \nartists to Haiti’s cultural scene, as well as European teachers, in order \nto establish public education. But while the king was initially \npopular among his subjects, his labor mandates were an \nuncomfortable reminder of the slavery Haitians fought to destroy. Over time, his increasingly authoritarian \npolicies lost support, and his opponents to the south \ngained strength. In October 1820, his reign finally \nreached its tragic conclusion. Months after a debilitating stroke \nleft him unable to govern, key members of his military \ndefected to southern forces. Betrayed and despondent, \nthe king committed suicide. Today, the traces of Christophe’s \ncomplicated history can still be found in the crumbling \nremains of his palaces, and in Haiti’s legacy as the first nation \nto permanently abolish slavery."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the name of President Alexandre Pétion’s successor?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Napoléon Bonaparte"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jean-Pierre Boyer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Henry Christophe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Louis XVI"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The country of Haiti was called what under French rule?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Saint-Thomas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Port-au-Prince"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Saint-Domingue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Grenada"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Henry Christophe is believed to have fought in another revolutionary war before the one in Haiti.

{"page": 18, "lesson": 4, "title": "3 ways to measure your adaptability— and how to improve it - Natalie Fratto", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/3-ways-to-measure-your-adaptability-and-how-to-improve-it-natalie-fratto", "transcript": {"en": "I met 273 start-up founders last year. And each one was looking for money. As a tech investor, my goal was to sort through\neveryone that I met and make a quick determination about which ones had the potential\nto make something really big. But what makes a great founder? This is a question I ask myself daily. Some venture capitalists place bets based on a founder's previous background. Did they go to an Ivy League school? Have they worked at a blue-chip company? Have they built out a big vision before? Effectively, how smart is this person? Other VCs asses a founder's\nemotional quotient, or EQ. How well will this person build teams and build rapport\nacross customers and clients? I have a different methodology\nto assess start-up founders, though, and it's not complicated. I look for signs of one specific trait. Not IQ, not EQ. It's adaptability: how well a person reacts\nto the inevitability of change, and lots of it. That's the single most important\ndeterminant for me. I subscribe to the belief that adaptability itself\nis a form of intelligence, and our adaptability quotient, or AQ, is something that can be measured,\ntested and improved. AQ isn't just useful\nfor start-up founders, however. I think it's increasingly\nimportant for all of us. Because the world is speeding up. We know that the rate\nof technological change is accelerating, which is forcing our brains to react. Whether you're navigating\nchanging job conditions brought on by automation, shifting geopolitics\nin a more globalized world, or simply changing family dynamics\nand personal relationships. Each of us, as individuals, groups, corporations and even governments are being forced to grapple\nwith more change than ever before in human history. So, how do we assess our adaptability? I use three tricks\nwhen meeting with founders. Here's the first. Think back to your\nmost recent job interview. What kind of questions were you asked? Probably some variation of,\n\"Tell me about a time when,\" right? Instead, to interview for adaptability, I like to ask \"what if\" questions. What if your main revenue stream\nwere to dry up overnight? What if a heat wave prevented\nevery single customer from being able to visit your store? Asking \"what if,\" instead\nof asking about the past, forces the brain to simulate. To picture multiple possible\nversions of the future. The strength of that vision, as well as how many distinct scenarios\nsomeone can conjure, tells me a lot. Practicing simulations\nis a sort of safe testing ground for improving adaptability. Instead of testing how you take in\nand retain information, like an IQ test might, it tests how you manipulate information, given a constraint, in order to achieve a specific goal. The second trick that I use\nto assess adaptability in founders is to look for signs of unlearning. Active unlearners seek to challenge\nwhat they presume to already know, and instead, override that data\nwith new information. Kind of like a computer\nrunning a disk cleanup. Take the example of Destin Sandlin, who programed his bicycle\nto turn left when he steered it right and vice versa. He called this his Backwards Brain Bike, and it took him nearly eight months just to learn how to ride it\nkind of, sort of normally. The fact that Destin was able\nto unlearn his regular bike in favor of a new one, though, signals something awesome\nabout our adaptability. It's not fixed. Instead, each of us\nhas the capacity to improve it, through dedication and hard work. On the last page of Gandhi's\nautobiography, he wrote, \"I must reduce myself to zero.\" At many points in his very full life, he was still seeking to return\nto a beginner's mindset, to zero. To unlearn. In this way, I think\nit's pretty safe to say Gandhi had a high AQ score. (Laughter) The third and final trick that I use to assess\na founder's adaptability is to look for people\nwho infuse exploration into their life and their business. There's a sort of natural tension\nbetween exploration and exploitation. And collectively, all of us tend to overvalue exploitation. Here's what I mean. In the year 2000, a man finagled his way\ninto a meeting with John Antioco, the CEO of Blockbuster, and proposed a partnership to manage Blockbuster's\nfledgling online business. The CEO John laughed him\nout of the room, saying, \"I have millions of existing customers and thousands of successful retail stores. I really need to focus on the money.\" The other man in the meeting, however, turned out to be Reed Hastings,\nthe CEO of Netflix. In 2018, Netflix brought in\n15.8 billion dollars, while Blockbuster\nfiled for bankruptcy in 2010, directly 10 years after that meeting. The Blockbuster CEO was too focused on exploiting\nhis already successful business model, so much so that he couldn't see\naround the next corner. In that way, his previous success became the enemy\nof his adaptability potential. For the founders that I work with, I frame exploration\nas a state of constant seeking. To never fall too far in love\nwith your wins but rather continue to proactively\nseek out what might kill you next. When I first started\nexploring adaptability, the thing I found most exciting\nis that we can improve it. Each of us has the capacity\nto become more adaptable. But think of it like a muscle: it's got to be exercised. And don't get discouraged\nif it takes a while. Remember Destin Sandlin? It took him eight months\njust to learn how to ride a bike. Over time, using the tricks\nthat I use on founders -- asking \"what if\" questions,\nactively unlearning and prioritizing exploration\nover exploitation can put you in the driver's seat -- so that the next time\nsomething big changes, you're already prepared. We're entering a future where IQ and EQ both matter way less\nthan how fast you're able to adapt. So I hope that these tools\nhelp you to raise your own AQ. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

{"page": 18, "lesson": 6, "title": "How much sleep do you actually need?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/CZ0o3OZb", "transcript": {"en": "Tired? We all know the feeling; irritable, groggy and exceptionally lazy. Chances are you didn't sleep enough last night, or the past few nights. But what exactly is \"enough sleep?\" And more importantly, can you ever \"catch up\" on it? While the very function of sleep is still debated by scientists, we do know that it's necessary to function efficiently and productively. After all, we spend 24 years of our lifetime sleeping, it had better be important. Researchers have tested how much is required each night by assigning groups of people to four, five, and eight hours of sleep over extended periods of time. After 14 days, those with eight hours of sleep exhibited few attention lapses of cognitive issues; however, those with six or four hours of sleep showed a steady decline. In fact, after only two weeks, the six hour group showed a similar reaction time to a person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1%, which is considered legally drunk. The four hour sleepers suffered even more, occasionally falling asleep during their cognitive tests. In both groups, brain function decreased day by day, almost linearly with no sign of leveling off. Scientists have dubbed this cumulative effect as sleep debt. So can we recover from it? After a night or two of little sleep, studies show that the body and brain can fully recover with a few nights of good sleep. However, with long term sleep deprivation on the scale of weeks to months, the recovery of cognitive function is much slower, requiring many more nights of quality sleep. On the timescale of months to years, it is unknown whether brain function can be fully repaired, or if it causes permanent damage. Paradoxically, with chronic sleep deprivation, your sleepiness or how tired you feel does eventually level off, meaning that you become less and less aware of your objective impairment over time. So how long should you sleep? Most studies tend to show that seven to eight hours of sleep is the average ideal for humans. Apart from the cognitive issues, individuals who consistently sleep less than seven hours a night have an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, not to mention a 12% higher risk of death. On the flip side, studies have shown that while sleeping more than eight hours does not impair brain function, it also carries an increased risk of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, and a 30% increased risk of mortality! So too much sleep may also be a bad thing. But variation most certainly exists, and our genetics play a large role. In fact, individuals genuinely unaffected by only six hours of sleep were found to have a mutation of a specific gene. When scientists genetically engineered mice to express this gene, they were able to stay awake for an extra 1.2 hours than normal mice. It turns out these short sleepers have more biologically intense sleep sessions than the average person. Ultimately, while it's important to know the ideal average of seven to eight hours exists, let your body and brain help you figure out its own needs. After all, no one shoe size fits all.

The first: a prison cell. The second: complete amnesia. And the third: a mysterious stranger \nhas gotten stuck squeezing through the bars on her window. His name is Hedge, and he has come \nto help Ethic save the world. But first they have to break out of jail. Hedge turns his hand into a lockpick and \noutlines the challenge ahead. Each lock in the prison works \nin the same unusual way. Inside the keyhole is a red dial that can \nbe rotated to one of 100 positions numbered 1 through 100. The key for a given cell spins the dial \nto the right position, which, when stopped there, makes it turn \ngreen and unlocks the door. It would be out of the question to steal \nkeys from a guard, but Hedge has a better idea. Hedge can carry out Ethic‘s commands. If Ethic tells him to walk \n5 steps forward, turn right, then walk another 5 steps, that’s exactly what he’ll do. Hedge needs specific instructions though. If Ethic says “pick the lock” or \n“try every combination” that would be too vague, but “spin the \ndial 5 positions forward” would work. Once out of the cell, they will only have \na few moments to crack the lock for the outer prison door too before \nthe guards catch them. So what instructions will allow Hedge \nto efficiently open any door? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Before we explain the solution, \nhere’s a hint. A key programming concept that can help \nunlock the door is called a loop. This can be one or more instructions \nthat Hedge will iterate— or repeat— a specified number of times, like “jump up and down 100 times.” Or an instruction that Hedge will \nrepeat until a condition is met, such as “keep jumping up and \ndown until it’s 7 o’clock.” Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The first thing that’s clear is that you \nneed to find a way for Hedge to try every combination until one works. What takes a little more effort is \nhow exactly you do so. One solution would be to instruct Hedge \nto try every combination in succession. Try 1 and check the light. If it turns green, open the door, \nand if not, try 2. If that doesn’t work try 3. \nAll the way up to 100. But it would be tedious to lay \nthat out in its entirety. Why write more than 100 lines of code, when you can do the same thing \nwith just 3? This is where a loop comes in. There are a few ways to go about this. The lock has 100 positions, so Ethic could say “Check the dial’s \ncolor, then spin the dial forward once, for 100 repetitions. Remember where the dial turns green, then \nhave Hedge set it back to that number.” A loop like this, where you specify \nthe number of times it repeats, is called a “for\" loop. But an even more efficient loop would have Hedge spin the dial one \nposition at a time until it turns green and as soon as that happens, have him \nstop and open the door. That way if the door unlocks on 1, he doesn’t need to cycle through \nall the rest of the numbers. This is an “until” loop, because it involves doing an \naction until a condition is met. A similar, alternate approach would be \nto turn the dial while it’s still red, then stop. That’s called a “while” loop. Back to the adventure. Hedge loops through the combinations, \nand the cell opens at 41. Ethic and Hedge wait until the \nperfect moment in the guards’ rotation and make a break for it. Soon, Ethic faces a choice: \nhide inside a mysterious crystal, or try to crack the outer door \nand make a run for it. Ethic chooses to run. The second door takes Hedge longer, \nrequiring him to spin all the way to 93. But he gets it open and takes the opportunity \nto explain why he’s rescued Ethic. The world is in turmoil: robots have taken over, \nand only Ethic can set things right. In order to do so, they’ll need to collect three \npowerful artifacts that are being used for nefarious \npurposes across the land. Only then can Ethic return to the \nworld machine— that giant crystal— to set things right. Ethic may have escaped the prison… but what has she gotten herself into?"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 18, "lesson": 8, "title": "Einstein's twin paradox explained - Amber Stuver", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/einstein-s-twin-paradox-explained-amber-l-stuver", "transcript": {"en": "On their 20th birthday, identical twin \nastronauts volunteer for an experiment. Terra will remain on Earth, while Stella \nwill board a spaceship. Stella’s ship will travel at 86.6% the \nspeed of light to visit a star that is 10 \nlight-years away, then return to Earth at the same speed. As they prepare to part ways, the twins wonder what will happen \nwhen they’re reunited. Since a light year is exactly the distance\nlight can travel in a year, Stella’s journey should take 23 years. But from having studied \nspecial relativity, the twins know it’s not that simple. First of all, the faster an object moves \nthrough space, the slower it moves through time \ncompared to an unmoving observer. This relationship can be quantified with \nsomething called the Lorentz factor, which is defined by this equation. And secondly, the length of a moving \nobject as measured by an observer at rest will contract by the same factor. At 86.6% of the speed of light \nthe Lorentz factor is 2, meaning time will pass twice as slowly \naboard the spaceship. Of course, Stella won’t notice \ntime slowing down. That’s because all time-based processes \nin the ship will slow down as well– clocks and electrical devices; Stella’s biological activities including \nher rate of aging and her perception of time itself. The only people who could notice time\non the moving spaceship passing slower for Stella would be observers in an inertial, \nor non-accelerating, reference frame– like Terra back on Earth. Thus, Terra concludes that when they meet\nback on Earth, she’ll be older than Stella. But that’s just one way of \nlooking at things. Because all movement is relative, Stella argues it would be just as valid to\nsay her spaceship will stand still while the rest of the universe, \nincluding Terra, moves around her. And in that case, time will pass twice as \nslowly for Terra, making Stella the older twin in the end. They can’t each be older than the other, \nso which one of them is right? This apparent contradiction is known as\nthe “Twin Paradox.” But it’s not really a paradox– just an example of how special relativity \ncan be easily misunderstood. To test their theories in real-time, each of the twins agrees to send \na burst of light to the other every time a year has passed for them. Unlike other objects, the speed of light \nis always constant regardless of an observer’s \nreference frame. A light burst sent from Earth will be \nmeasured at the same speed as a light burst sent from the spaceship, regardless of whether it’s on its \noutbound or return trip. So when one twin observes \na burst of light, they’re measuring how long it took the \nother twin to experience a year passing, plus how long it took for light \nto travel between them. We can track what’s happening on a graph. The X axis marks distance from Earth, \nand the Y axis tracks the passage of time. From Terra’s perspective, her path will \nsimply be a vertical line, with distance equal to zero and each tick on the line equivalent \nto a year as she perceives it. Stella’s path will stretch from the same \norigin to a point 11.5 years in time and 10 light-years in distance from Terra… before converging again at zero \ndistance and 23 years’ time. At her first one-year mark, Terra will send a pulse of light from \nEarth towards Stella’s spaceship. Since light takes a year to travel \none light-year, its path will be a 45-degree \ndiagonal line. And because Stella is \ntraveling away from it, by the time the light catches up to her, over 7 total years will have passed for\nTerra, and over 4 for Stella. By the time Stella observes \nTerra’s second burst, she will already be on her return journey. But now, since she’s moving towards the \nsource of the light, it will take less time to reach her, and she’ll observe the bursts \nmore frequently. This means that Stella observes Terra \naging slowly for the first half of her journey, but aging rapidly during the return half. Meanwhile for Stella, it seems as though \nTerra, the destination star, and the whole universe are \nmoving around her. And because of length contraction, Stella observes the distance between \nthem shrinking by a factor of 2. This means each leg of the trip will only \ntake about six years from Stella’s perspective. When she sends the first signal to Earth, \ntwo years will have passed for Terra. Stella will send four more light bursts \nduring her outbound journey, each one from farther away. By the time Terra observes the first pulse\nfrom Stella's inbound journey, over 21 years will have passed for her. For the rest of Stella's return home, Terra receives multiple light \nbursts each year. Thus, Terra observes Stella aging slowly \nfor about 90% of their 23 years apart, and aging rapidly during the last 10%. This asymmetry accounts for why the \nparadox isn’t really a paradox. Although each twin witnesses time both speeding up and slowing \ndown for the other, Stella sees an even split, while Terra sees Stella aging slowly for \nmost of the time they’re apart. This is consistent with each twin’s \nmeasurement of the space voyage, which takes 23 Earth years, but only \n11.5 as experienced aboard the ship. When the twins are reunited, Terra will be\n43 years old, while Stella will be 31. Where Stella went wrong was her assumption that she and Terra had\nequal claim to being inertial observers. To be an inertial observer, one has to \nmaintain a constant speed and direction relative to the rest of the universe. Terra was at rest the entire time, \nso her velocity was a constant zero. But when Stella changed her direction \nfor the return journey, she entered a different reference frame \nfrom the one she’d started in. Terra and Stella now both have a better\nunderstanding of how spacetime works.

{"page": 18, "lesson": 9, "title": "Why should you read “The God of Small Things” by Arundhati Roy? - Laura Wright", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-the-god-of-small-things-by-arundhati-roy-laura-wright", "transcript": {"en": "“A few dozen hours can affect the \noutcome of whole lifetimes/ And that when they do, \nthose few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains \nof a burned clock… must be resurrected from the ruins \nand examined.” This is the premise of Arundhati Roy’s \n1997 novel \"The God of Small Things.\" Set in a town in Kerala, India called \nAyemenem, the story revolves around fraternal \ntwins Rahel and Estha, who are separated for 23 years \nafter the fateful few dozen hours in which their cousin drowns, their \nmother’s illicit affair is revealed, and her lover is murdered. While the book is set at the point of \nRahel and Estha’s reunion, the narrative takes place mostly in\nthe past, reconstructing the details around the tragic events that \nled to their separation. Roy’s rich language and masterful \nstorytelling earned her the prestigious Booker prize \nfor \"The God of Small Things.\" In the novel, she interrogates the culture\nof her native India, including its social mores \nand colonial history. One of her focuses is the caste system, a way of classifying people by hereditary \nsocial class that is thousands of years old. By the mid-20th century, the original four castes associated \nwith specific occupations had been divided into \nsome 3000 sub-castes. Though the caste system was \nConstitutionally abolished in 1950, it continued to shape \nsocial life in India, routinely marginalizing people \nof lower castes. In the novel, Rahel and Estha have a \nclose relationship with Velutha, a worker in their family’s pickle factory and member of the so-called \n“untouchable” caste. When Velutha and the twins’ mother, Ammu,\nembark on an affair, they violate what Roy describes as the \n“love laws” forbidding intimacy between \ndifferent castes. Roy warns that the tragic consequences \nof their relationship “would lurk forever in ordinary things,” \nlike “coat hangers,” “the tar on roads,” and “the absence of words.” Roy’s writing makes constant use of these \nordinary things, bringing lush detail to even the most \ntragic moments. The book opens at the funeral of the \ntwins’ half-British cousin Sophie after her drowning. As the family mourns, lilies curl and \ncrisp in the hot church. A baby bat crawls up a funeral sari. Tears drip from a chin like \nraindrops from a roof. The novel forays into the past to explore\nthe characters’ struggles to operate in a world \nwhere they don’t quite fit, alongside their nation’s \npolitical turmoil. Ammu struggles not to lash out at her \nbeloved children when she feels particularly trapped in her\nparents’ small-town home, where neighbors judge and shun her \nfor being divorced. Velutha, meanwhile, balances his affair\nwith Ammu and friendship with the twins not only with his employment \nto their family, but also with his membership to a \nbudding communist countermovement to Indira Ghandi’s “Green Revolution.” In the 1960s, the misleadingly named \n“Green Revolution” introduced chemical fertilizers \nand pesticides and the damming of rivers to India. While these policies produced high-yield \ncrops that staved off famine, they also forced people from lower castes \noff their land and caused widespread \nenvironmental damage. When the twins return to Ayemenem \nas adults, the consequences of the Green Revolution \nare all around them. The river that was bursting with life \nin their childhood greets them “with a ghastly skull’s smile,\nwith holes where teeth had been, and a limp hand raised \nfrom a hospital bed.” As Roy probes the depths of human \nexperience, she never loses sight of the way her \ncharacters are shaped by the time and the place where they live. In the world of \"The God of Small Things,\" “Various kinds of despair competed \nfor primacy… personal despair could never be \ndesperate enough... personal turmoil dropped by at the wayside\nshrine of the vast, violent, circling, driving, ridiculous, insane, unfeasible \npublic turmoil of a nation.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The name of the family business in the novel is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Paradise Pickles and Preserves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pappachi’s Pickles and Peanuts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rahel’s Raisins and Raspberries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Velutha’s Vitamins"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Even though Rahel and Estha’s family observes the rules of the caste system, they belong to what religion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Muslim"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Buddhist"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Syrian Christian"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Jewish"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When Velutha’s father, Vellya Paapen, discovers that his son is having an affair with Ammu, he goes to Mammachi and tells her.

Unlike his home Kalevala, Pohjola was \na dark and frozen land, ruled by Louhi, “the gap-tooth \nhag of the North.\" The cunning witch nursed Väinämöinen \nback to health but demanded a reward for \nreturning him home. Not content with mere gold or silver, Louhi wanted what did not yet exist— \nthe Sampo. To be forged from “the tips of white-swan\nfeathers,\" “the milk of greatest virtue,\" “a single grain of barley,\" and \n“the finest wool of lambskins,\" this artifact was said to be \nan endless font of wealth. But Väinämöinen knew that \nonly Seppo Ilmarinen, the Eternal Hammerer who forged \nthe sky-dome itself, could craft such an object. So he convinced Louhi to send him \nhome and fetch the smith. Though the journey was far from easy, \nthe bard finally made it back to Kalevala. But Ilmarinen refused to go to the gloomy \nNorth— a land of witches and man-eaters. But keeping true to his word, Väinämöinen tricked Ilmarinen \ninto climbing a giant tree, before summoning a mighty storm \nto carry the smith all the way to Pohjola. Ilmarinen was well received in the North. Louhi lavished her guest with \nextravagant hospitality and promised him the hand \nof her beautiful daughter— if he could craft what she wished. When she finally asked if Ilmarinen \nwas capable of forging the Sampo, the powerful smith declared he could \nindeed accomplish the task. But try as he might to bend \nthe forge to his will, its fires only produced other artifacts— beautiful in appearance but \nill-mannered in nature. An elegant crossbow that \nthirsted for blood and a gleaming plow that ruined cultivated\nfields among others. Finally, Ilmarinen summoned the winds \nthemselves to work the bellows, and in three days time he \npulled the Sampo, with its lid of many colors from \nthe forge’s flames. On its sides the smith carefully crafted \na grain mill, a salt mill, and a money mill. Louhi was so delighted with the object’s \nlimitless productive power that she ran off to lock her treasure \ninside a mountain. But when Ilmarinen tried to \nclaim his prize, the promised maiden refused to marry him,\nand the smith had to return home alone. Years passed, and while \nPohjola prospered, Ilmarinen and Väinämöinen were without \nwives or great wealth. Bitter about this injustice, the bard \nproposed a quest to retrieve the Sampo, and the two sailed north with the \nhelp of Lemminkäinen— a beautiful young man with a history \nof starting trouble. Upon arrival, Väinämöinen requested half \nthe Sampo’s profits as compensation— or they’d take the artifact by force. Outraged at this request, Louhi summoned \nher forces to fight the heroes. But as her army readied for war, \nthe bard played his magic harp, Kantele, entrancing all who heard it and sending \nPohjola into a deep slumber. Unimpeded, the three men took the Sampo \nand quietly made their escape. Lemminkäinen was ecstatic \nat their success, and demanded that Väinämöinen sing \nof their triumph. The bard refused, knowing the dangers \nof celebrating too early. But after three days of traveling, \nLemminkäinen’s excitement overwhelmed him, and he recklessly broke out in song. His awful singing voice woke \na nearby crane, whose screeching cries roused \nthe Pohjolan horde. The army made chase. As their warship closed in, Väinämöinen \nraised a rock to breach their hull. Undeterred, Louhi transformed \ninto a giant eagle, carrying her army on her back as they \nattacked the heroes’ vessel. She managed to grab the Sampo \nin her claw, but just as quickly, it dropped into \nthe sea, shattering into pieces and sinking deep beyond her talon’s reach.

A 360° animation - Michael Lipman", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-makes-neon-signs-glow-a-360-animation-michael-lipman", "transcript": {"en": "When the Hoover Dam was \ncompleted in 1936, it created a huge source of \nhydroelectric power and zapped a sleepy desert town to life: \nLas Vegas, Nevada. With the power supply from the dam, Las Vegas soon exploded \nwith vibrant displays. The source of these dazzling lights was \nelectrified neon gas. There are two tricky obstacles \nto making lighted signs out of this naturally clear, \nodorless gas: capturing it and making it glow. French inventor Georges Claude came up \nwith techniques to do both. In 1902, he developed a way of liquefying and \nseparating specific gases from the air, producing neon on an industrial \nscale for the first time. By 1910, he had come up with a way \nto trap the gas in a glass tube with a special electrode at either end, \nand neon lighting was born. In workshops like Claude's, artisans known as tube-benders \nmade neon signs by hand. The tube-benders heated small sections \nof a long, hollow glass tube and quickly bent them into shape. After the glass cooled, they attached \nelectrodes to each end and removed the air with a vacuum pump. Then, they passed a high voltage \ncurrent through the tube to remove any impurities on the \ninside of the glass. Finally, they pumped the neon gas in \nand sealed off the electrodes. When a neon sign is turned on, the electric current causes some of \nthe neon atoms' electrons to accelerate and break free of their orbits, leaving \nbehind positively charged ions. As these free electrons rush from \none electrode to the other, they collide with more neon atoms, \ncausing them to ionize as well. When these excited electrons fall back \nto their normal energy levels, their excess energy is carried away \nby photons, or particles of light. All this happens in an instant, and the glow from the photons is what \nwe see when we switch on a neon sign. Though it's common to call any \ngas-filled sign a \"neon\" sign, there are actually 5 different \ngases used in production. Each gas emits photons of a different \nwavelength when electrified, which correspond to different \ncolors of light. Neon gives off an orange-red glow, argon \nglows a pale lavender, helium a dusty pink, krypton a silver-\nwhite, and xenon a light purple. These 5 gases can be combined \nwith color-coated tubing to create an electrified rainbow of \ntext and images. Business owners soon realized how \neffective these colorful beacons were for attracting customers. And unlike a light bulb, a neon sign has \nno incandescent filaments to burn out, and can shine continuously for 40 years \nbefore the gas depletes. By the 1930s, neon signs were lighting \nup storefronts all over the world. Because of the glass tubes' \nfragile nature, it usually wasn't feasible to ship \nthem over long distances. Instead, most neon signs were created by \nlocal neon shops and then installed nearby. Signs with humor, personality, and \nintricate designs proliferated, no two exactly alike. But by the end of World War II, plastics had become widely \navailable and inexpensive, and plastic signs supplanted neon \nas messengers of modernity. Many towns removed neon signs they \nviewed as old-fashioned.

Little do they know that a third party— Sausage Saloon— has sent you to take advantage \nof the situation. As their top spy, your skills range from \ninfiltration and subterfuge, to safecracking and reading faces \nfor signs of deception. You’ve tracked the captors to where \nthey’re holding the chef prisoner. From your hiding spot, you can see him \non the other side of the glass, while in front of you an interrogator \nwearing headphones speaks into a microphone. “We already know the recipe is on the \n13th floor of the bank vault, in a safe deposit box numbered between \n13 and 1300. Now tell us… Is the number less than 500?” You can’t hear the chef’s answer, \nbut you can see that he’s lying. The interrogator, however, falls for it. He follows up by asking, \n“Is it a perfect square?” Again you can’t hear the answer \nbut can tell the chef is lying, while the interrogator takes \nhim at his word. He then asks, “Is it a perfect cube?” This time the chef answers truthfully. The interrogator thinks \nfor a minute and says, “Good. Now if you just tell me whether \nor not the number’s second digit is a one, we’ll be done here.” But as the chef starts to answer, the interrogator stands up, \nblocking your view. Within moments he rushes out of the room, announcing that he’s got the answer and \nis sending agents to retrieve the recipe. You know that the Burger Bazaar people \nhave the wrong box number. But can you figure out the right one \nand retrieve the recipe yourself? Pause the video to figure it \nout for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The key here is to work backwards. We don’t know what the chef answers \nto the final question or whether he answers truthfully. But we do know that by the time \nthe interrogator asks it, he’s narrowed the options \ndown to two numbers– one where the second digit is 1, \nand one where it isn’t. Our goal, then, is to find answers to the \nprevious questions that lead to just two possibilities. Of the three constraints offered, the one that narrows our options the most \nis if the number is a perfect cube. That leaves us with only eight answers \nbetween 13 and 1300. So let’s assume the answer to the \nthird question was a truthful YES. Now, let’s look at the second question. If the chef answered YES to the number \nbeing a perfect square, it would narrow the interrogator’s options\nto just 64 and 729– the only numbers in our range that are \nboth a square and a cube. But neither of these has a 1 \nas the second digit. So the given answer to the second question\nmust’ve been NO. And that also means we can eliminate these\ntwo squares from the interrogator's list, leaving only six numbers. Now for the first question, \nwhich allows us to divide this list. If the chef answered YES to the number \nbeing less than 500, we’d have four options, which is too many. But a NO leaves us with two numbers \ngreater than 500, one of which does have \na 1 as its second digit. We don’t know which of these numbers \nthe interrogator thinks is correct. But that doesn’t matter– remember, his conclusion \nwas based on lies. You, on the other hand, are now in a \nposition to reconstruct the truth. First, the chef said the number was \ngreater than 500 but lied, meaning it’s actually less than 500. Second, the chef said it wasn’t a \nperfect square but lied again, meaning the number is indeed a square. And finally, he truthfully confirmed \nthat it was also a cube. And as we’ve already seen, the only number under 500 that’s \nboth a square and a cube is 64. You find the secret recipe and are gone \nbefore anyone’s the wiser. Corporate espionage is not an easy game— but sometimes, that’s just \nhow the sausage is made."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why don’t you know what actual answers the chef gives?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "You can’t see him"}, {"label": "B", "text": "You can’t hear him"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He’s prevented from answering"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which floor is the safe deposit box on?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "13th"}, {"label": "B", "text": "64th"}, {"label": "C", "text": "12th"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a perfect cube?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "216"}, {"label": "B", "text": "625"}, {"label": "C", "text": "343"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What number box does the interrogator think the recipe is in?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "64"}, {"label": "B", "text": "512"}, {"label": "C", "text": "We don’t know"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What number box is the recipe actually in?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "64"}, {"label": "B", "text": "512"}, {"label": "C", "text": "We don’t know"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 18, "lesson": 13, "title": "What you should know about vaping and e-cigarettes - Suchitra Krishnan-Sarin", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-you-should-know-about-vaping-and-e-cigarettes-suchitra-krishnan-sarin", "transcript": {"en": "\"It gets easier, right?\" These are the words\nI often hear from young parents who are new to the game\nof worrying about their children. I tell them that it doesn't. It gets different, but there's always something\nto worry about as parents. I remember how I would lie\nhalf-awake at night listening to my son breathe when he was young and had asthma, and then, when he was a teen, until I heard the front door chime open, and I knew that he was home safe. Worrying about our kids\ncomes with the territory. Now, many of these worries\nare about basic issues, like what they eat,\nwhere they are, who they're with. But we also need to keep an eye on\nnew behaviors and fads. The latest craze is something\nthat may not yet be on everyone's radar as a serious health concern, and that is the newfound\npopularity of vaping, or inhaling sweet aerosols produced by vaporizing\ne-liquids in e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, or \"vapes,\"\nas they are commonly called, are flying off the shelves like candy. This year, the e-cigarette\nmarket is expected to drive 26 billion dollars in sales worldwide. Over the next six years, that volume is expected to double. We have a lot of serious concerns\nabout the health impact of vaping, and unfortunately,\nnot nearly enough answers. This becomes even more concerning\nwhen you think of who uses e-cigarettes. E-cigarette use, at least in the US, has grown rapidly among youth\nand young adults -- our kids, our most vulnerable population. There was a 900 percent growth\nin the use of e-cigarettes by youth between 2012 and 2015. The most recent estimates suggest that approximately 3.6 million\nhigh school and middle school students have used e-cigarettes in the US. Now, e-cigarettes were originally created to offer smokers a cleaner\nform of nicotine to help with their cigarette addiction. In the US, these devices\ncome under the FDA's jurisdiction as a tobacco product. But the science on these devices\nhas not been able to keep up with the rapid market growth, so regulations on the components\nof these devices and e-liquids are lagging. Current regulations do restrict\nsales of these devices to anyone under the age of 18, but these do not seem\nto have had much of an impact on the explosion in the use\nof these devices by teens. You know, the first time\nI heard of and saw an e-cigarette, I knew right away\nthat teens would love it. These devices are technology on a stick, a perfect fit for\nthe smartphone generation -- small, rechargeable, easy to use,\neasy to modify, nice smelling -- some even sync with your smartphone\nto let you know how much you have vaped. Even I was very drawn\nto these very clever devices. And since I had spent a long time\nresearching teen and adult addictions, I immediately realized that these devices\nfit perfectly into the teen psyche. Teens are impulsive,\nand they love to try new things. They're also craving independence,\nand they love to make things their own. E-cigarettes meet these needs perfectly by allowing them the chance\nto both innovate and personalize their vape experience. They can choose from over 15,000\ndifferent e-liquid flavors and multiple nicotine concentrations. They can even create their own\nnicotine flavor combination. They can change how much vapor\nis produced from these devices by modifying the puff volume\nand the constituents and the power and temperature\nof the devices. They can even use these devices\nfor \"cloud chasing.\" Cloud chasing, also called vape tricks or smoke tricks, involves producing large vape clouds\nwith quirky shapes and names, like rings, dragons, ghosts ... Cloud chasers can even participate\nin cloud competitions and win prizes for creating\nthe most innovative shaped clouds. Teens can also change the strength\nand throat hit from the vapor by either vaporizing the e-liquid\nat higher temperatures or dripping the e-liquid\ndirectly onto a heated coil. They can even use these devices\nfor marijuana vaping. And since the devices\nuse lower temperatures and do not combust or burn the marijuana, they can do this very discreetly, without the distinctive smell\nof burnt marijuana. So they can really make these vape\nexperiences their own, which may explain the astounding rise\nin the use of these devices by youth. E-cigarettes are technically\na very simple device. There is a receptacle for the e-liquid\nwhich can be a tank, a pod or a plug. There is a battery that charges the coil,\nwhich then vaporizes the e-liquid. And then there is a mouthpiece, where the user can actually draw\nfrom the e-cigarette. In 2017, there were 466 e-cigarette\ndevices in the marketplace. These range from cigarette-like devices\nwhich are also called \"cigalikes\" to tank systems,\nwhich are also called \"pens.\" And then there are modified devices,\nwhich are also called \"mods.\" Mods look nothing like a cigarette, and they come in various shapes and sizes, with different kinds of attachments\nand user adjustments. They're very popular for cloud chasing. The most recent entrance\ninto the marketplace are the pod devices, which contain the e-liquid in a pod. These are very popular,\nby the way, among teens. An example of this is the Juul, which not only looks like a USB device but can also be plugged\ninto a USB outlet to charge. Many teens do not even think\nthat these are e-cigarettes, which has led to the use of terms\nlike \"juuling\" instead of \"vaping.\" Many of these devices are so discreet\nand produce so little vapor that teens are using them in classrooms and hiding them in objects\nlike Sharpie pens, their clothes, their books. Now, many teens think\nthat these devices produce water vapor, and therefore, they are safe to use. But this could not be\nfurther from the truth. What is produced is not even a vapor, it's an aerosol, and let me tell you, the difference\nis quite pronounced. Aerosols contain many finely suspended\nparticles of liquids and gases that are created\nfrom whatever is in the e-liquid. So an aerosol could contain\npropylene glycol and glycerin, which are solvents in the e-liquid. Now, these solvents are known\nto be safe for edible use, so for use in products that you eat, but we know very little about their safety\nfollowing long-term inhalational exposure. The e-liquids can also contain alcohol, sometimes in high levels, and inhaling alcohol is known\nto have toxic effects on the brain. I told you earlier that the e-liquids\ncontain over 15,000 different flavors. Here are some examples, some with very catchy but familiar names\nlike \"Skittles\" and \"Fruit Loops,\" and others with more exotic names\nlike \"Dragon's Milk\" and \"Tiger's Blood\" and \"Unicorn Puke.\" The e-liquid or the aerosol\ncan also contain metallic particles like chromium, cadmium and lead. These are generated\nfrom the heating coil in the devices and are also known to have\nmany toxic effects on vital organs. So no, let me make this very clear: what is produced is definitely\nnot water vapor. Exposure of the teen brain to nicotine\nthrough e-cigarettes is also very concerning. The teen brain is very sensitive\nto even low levels of nicotine and gets very easily addicted. In fact, we have known for a long time that 90 percent of smokers start smoking\ncigarettes prior to the age of 18. Those who start early are more addicted\nand have a harder time quitting smoking. In other words, and to quote\na past FDA commissioner, \"Nicotine addiction ...\nis a pediatric disease.\" E-cigarettes can expose teens\nto a lot of nicotine. Many of these devices contain\nthe amount of nicotine that is in a full pack of cigarettes. The more recent pod devices\ncontain a nicotine salt, which has a smoother taste\nand is much easier to use and can produce rapid increases\nin brain nicotine levels. Teens who use e-cigarettes regularly\nreport symptoms of craving -- feeling anxious when they don't\nhave their e-cigarettes. All these are hallmarks\nof a behavioral addiction. E-cigarettes are not only addictive but they also affect\nmany other organs in the body. So nicotine, which is\nin e-cigarettes, for example, binds to a receptor called\nthe nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which plays a key role in the functioning\nof almost all organ systems in the human body. And chronic exposure to nicotine\nchanges the functioning of these systems. So as an example, chronic exposure to nicotine decreases\nthe flexibility of the blood vessels and changes how the heart responds\nto acute challenges like stress. The teen brain is not only sensitive\nto the addictive effects of nicotine but also to its toxic effects. In adolescent animals, nicotine\nis a very well-established neurotoxin, and it decreases learning,\nmemory and attention processes and increases hyperactivity symptoms. Teens who use tobacco products\nare more likely to use marijuana and alcohol and also develop depression and anxiety\nas a teen or as an adult. So nicotine addiction through e-cigarettes\ncould be leading them down the path of other addictions\nand other mental health problems. Now, in adolescent animals, nicotine\nalso produces epigenetic changes, or heritable changes in gene expression, for example, in the genes\ninvolved in asthma. So teens who use nicotine may not only\nbe harming themselves but they could be harming\ntheir future generations. You know, the very existence\nof e-cigarettes could have led to an entire generation\nof nicotine-addicted youth. Easy access to these devices\ncould have led to more experimentation with marijuana and many other\nvaporizable substances by youth. While there is no doubt that providing\nsmokers with a cleaner form of nicotine is and should continue\nto be a critical goal, we still do not know if these devices\nhelp smokers quit smoking, and we know very little about\nthe long-term effects of these devices. What we do know is that youth --\nlots of youth -- are using these devices. In fact, the FDA commissioner\nrecently used the term \"epidemic\" to describe e-cigarette use in the US. While trying to solve one huge\npublic health problem, cigarette smoking, we may have created another colossal one. Our lack of vigilance in the earlier years\naround cigarette smoking led to a cigarette epidemic and many,\nmany cigarette-related diseases. We do not want to repeat\nthe same mistakes with e-cigarettes. So now is the time for action, for regulations that address the appeal\nand access of these devices to youth. Do smokers really need 15,000\nkid-friendly flavors to quit smoking? Do they need so many different\nkinds of devices? Is it a good idea to have devices\nwhich are so easy to hide and so easy to use? We recently heard that the FDA plans\nto introduce stricter regulations on sales of these devices\nthat contain e-liquid flavors in retail locations like convenience\nstores and gas stations, and also introduce stricter regulations on sales of devices\nto minors over the internet. Is this going to be sufficient to change\nthis rapid increase in youth uptake? We need to ask and answer\nsuch critical questions. Now is also the time for a serious\npublic education campaign. Teens and their parents need to know that while e-cigarettes may contain\nless toxins than cigarettes, they're certainly not benign. Exposure of their bodies to the chemicals\nproduced by these devices could be changing them in ways\nthey may not like and setting them up for future\nunknown toxicities and health problems. You know, when I said earlier that e-cigarettes were a perfect fit\nfor the smartphone generation, I was not kidding. We live in a technology-crazed world, where the latest device\nand technology gets a lot of attention just because it is technology\nand because it is the latest thing. More and more over the next few years\nand for the rest of our lives, we are going to see technologies\ncoming into the marketplace that may not raise\nany health flags at first, simply because they don't look unhealthy or they're not a medical device. For example, we could see devices that may make it easier\nto go longer without sleep or help us lose weight -- a personal goal of mine -- or achieve any number of other goals that we as consumers\nare very, very interested in. But many of these devices may come\nwith unacceptable risks to our own health. So if we want to protect our health\nand the health of our children, perhaps we should get out of the habit of automatically celebrating\nsuch new technology and get into the habit of looking\nat them with a critical eye, perhaps even through a medical lens. Because, you know something? Our health, the health of our children\nand our future generations is far too valuable\nto let it go up in smoke -- or even in aerosol. Thank you.

The king tries to retreat, but enemy \ncavalry flanks him from the rear. Escape is impossible. But this isn’t a real war– nor is it just a game. Over the roughly one-and-a-half millennia \nof its existence, chess has been known as a tool \nof military strategy, a metaphor for human affairs, \nand a benchmark of genius. While our earliest records of chess \nare in the 7th century, legend tells that the game’s origins \nlie a century earlier. Supposedly, when the youngest prince \nof the Gupta Empire was killed in battle, his brother devised a way of representing\nthe scene to their grieving mother. Set on the 8x8 ashtapada board used for\nother popular pastimes, a new game emerged with two key features: different rules for moving \ndifferent types of pieces, and a single king piece whose fate \ndetermined the outcome. The game was originally \nknown as chaturanga– a Sanskrit word for \"four divisions.\" But with its spread to Sassanid Persia, it acquired its current name \nand terminology– \"chess,\" derived from \"shah,\" meaning \nking, and “checkmate” from \"shah mat,\" or “the king is helpless.” After the 7th century Islamic conquest \nof Persia, chess was introduced to the Arab world. Transcending its role as a \ntactical simulation, it eventually became a rich source \nof poetic imagery. Diplomats and courtiers used chess terms \nto describe political power. Ruling caliphs became avid \nplayers themselves. And historian al-Mas’udi considered the \ngame a testament to human free will compared to games of chance. Medieval trade along the Silk Road carried\nthe game to East and Southeast Asia, where many local variants developed. In China, chess pieces were placed at \nintersections of board squares rather than inside them, as in the native \nstrategy game Go. The reign of Mongol leader Tamerlane saw \nan 11x10 board with safe squares called citadels. And in Japanese shogi, captured pieces \ncould be used by the opposing player. But it was in Europe that chess began to \ntake on its modern form. By 1000 AD, the game had become part \nof courtly education. Chess was used as an allegory for different social classes performing \ntheir proper roles, and the pieces were re-interpreted \nin their new context. At the same time, the Church remained \nsuspicious of games. Moralists cautioned against devoting \ntoo much time to them, with chess even being briefly \nbanned in France. Yet the game proliferated, and the 15th century saw it cohering into\nthe form we know today. The relatively weak piece of advisor was \nrecast as the more powerful queen– perhaps inspired by the recent surge \nof strong female leaders. This change accelerated the game’s pace, and as other rules were popularized, treatises analyzing common openings \nand endgames appeared. Chess theory was born. With the Enlightenment era, the game \nmoved from royal courts to coffeehouses. Chess was now seen as an expression \nof creativity, encouraging bold moves and dramatic plays. This \"Romantic\" style reached its peak \nin the Immortal Game of 1851, where Adolf Anderssen managed a checkmate after sacrificing his queen \nand both rooks. But the emergence of formal competitive \nplay in the late 19th century meant that strategic calculation would \neventually trump dramatic flair. And with the rise of international \ncompetition, chess took on a new \ngeopolitical importance. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union devoted great resources\nto cultivating chess talent, dominating the championships for the rest \nof the century. But the player who would truly upset \nRussian dominance was not a citizen of another country but an IBM computer called Deep Blue. Chess-playing computers had been \ndeveloped for decades, but Deep Blue’s triumph \nover Garry Kasparov in 1997 was the first time a machine \nhad defeated a sitting champion. Today, chess software is capable of \nconsistently defeating the best human players. But just like the game they’ve mastered, these machines are products \nof human ingenuity. And perhaps that same ingenuity will guide\nus out of this apparent checkmate."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where is chess believed to have been invented?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Persia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "India"}, {"label": "C", "text": "China"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT one of the military divisions represented in the original game?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "archers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "cavalry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "infantry"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What did the cleft shape of the bishop’s mitre originally represent?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "peasant’s pitchfork"}, {"label": "B", "text": "elephant’s tusks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "horse’s hoof"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What piece was replaced by the queen?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "chariot"}, {"label": "B", "text": "prince"}, {"label": "C", "text": "vizier"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following was NOT a historical chess variation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a hexagonal board with six players"}, {"label": "B", "text": "placing pieces at the intersections of squares"}, {"label": "C", "text": "an 11x10 board with safe squares"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

On August 14th, 1947, a woman in Bombay goes into labor \nas the clock ticks towards midnight. Across India, people hold their breath \nfor the declaration of independence after nearly two centuries of British \noccupation and rule. And at the stroke of midnight, a squirming infant and two new \nnations are born in perfect synchronicity. These events form the foundation \nof \"Midnight’s Children,\" a dazzling novel by the British-Indian \nauthor Salman Rushdie. The baby who is the exact same age \nas the nation is Saleem Sinai, the novel’s protagonist. His narrative stretches over \n30 years of his life, jumping backwards and forwards in time \nto speculate on family secrets and deep-seated mysteries. These include the greatest enigma of all: \nSaleem has magic powers, and they’re somehow related \nto the time of his birth. And he’s not the only one. All children born in and around \nthe stroke of midnight are imbued with extraordinary powers; like Parvati the Witch, \na spectacular conjurer; and Saleem’s nemesis Shiva, \na gifted warrior. With his powers of telepathy, Saleem forges connections with a \nvast network of the children of midnight— including a figure who can step \nthrough time and mirrors, a child who changes their gender \nwhen immersed in water, and multilingual conjoined twins. Saleem acts as a delightful guide \nto magical happenings and historical context alike. Although his birthday is a day \nof celebration, it also marks a turbulent period \nin Indian history. In 1948, the leader of the Indian \nindependence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, was assassinated. Independence also coincided \nwith Partition, which divided British-controlled India  into the two nations of India \nand Pakistan. This contributed to the outbreak of \nthe Indo-Pakistani Wars in 1965 and 1971. Saleem touches on all this and more, tracing the establishment \nof Bangladesh in 1971 and the emergency rule of Indira Gandhi. This vast historical frame is one \nreason why \"Midnight’s Children\" is considered one of the most illuminating\nworks of postcolonial literature ever written. This genre typically addresses the \nexperience of people living in colonized and formerly colonized countries, and explores the fallout through themes \nlike revolution, migration, and identity. Rushdie, who like Saleem was born in 1947,\nwas educated in India and Britain, and is renowned for his cross-continental \nhistories, political commentary, and magical realism. He enriches \"Midnight’s Children\" \nwith a plethora of Indian and Pakistani cultural references, from family traditions to food, \nreligion and folktales. Scribbling by night under the \nwatchful eyes of his lover Padma, Saleem’s frame narrative echoes \nthat of \"1001 Nights,\" where a woman named Scheherazade \ntells her king a series of stories to keep herself alive. And as Saleem sees it, 1001 is “the number of night, of magic, \nof alternative realities.” Over the course of the novel, Rushdie dazzles us with \nmultiple versions of reality. Sometimes, this is like reading \na rollercoaster. Saleem narrates: “Who what am I? My answer: I am everyone everything whose being-in-\nthe-world affected was affected by mine. I am anything that happens \nafter I’ve gone which would not have happened \nif I had not come. Nor am I particularly exceptional \nin this matter; each 'I,' every one of the now-six-\nhundred-million-plus of us, contains a similar multitude. I repeat for the last time: to understand me, \nyou’ll have to swallow a world.” Saleem’s narrative often has \na breathless quality— and even as Rushdie depicts the \ncosmological consequences of a life, he questions the idea that we can ever \ncondense history into a single narrative.

Think of Stonehenge, the Pyramids, Machu Picchu and Easter Island. Now, they're all pretty different\nfrom what we're doing today, with those massive stones, assembled in complex\nbut seemingly illogical ways, and all traces of their construction erased, shrouding them in mystery. It seems like people could not\nhave possibly built these things, because people didn't. They were carefully crafted\nby a primordial race of giants known as Cyclops. (Laughter) And I've been collaborating\nwith these monsters to learn their secrets\nfor moving those massive stones. And as it turns out,\nCyclops aren't even that strong. They're just really smart\nabout getting material to work for them. Now, the videos you see behind me\nof large, stone-like, wobbly creatures are the results of this collaboration. OK, so Cyclops might be\na mythical creature, but those wonders are still real. People made them. But they also made the myths\nthat surround them, and when it comes to wonders,\nthere's this thick connective tissue between mythology and reality. Take Easter Island, for example. When the Dutch explorers\nfirst encountered the island, they asked the people of Rapa Nui how their ancestors could have possibly\nmoved those massive statues. And the Rapa Nui said, \"Our ancestors didn't move the statues, because the statues walked themselves.\" For centuries, this was dismissed,\nbut actually it's true. The statues, known as moai,\nwere transported standing, pivoting from side to side. OK? As spectacular as the moai are\nfor visitors today, you have to imagine being there then, with colossal moai\nmarching around the island. Because the real memorial\nwas not the objects themselves, it was the cultural ritual\nof bringing a stone to life. So as an architect,\nI've been chasing that dream. How can we shift our idea of construction\nto accommodate that mythical side? So what I've been doing\nis challenging myself with putting on a series of performances of the ancient but\npretty straightforward task of just moving and standing\nbig heavy objects, like this 16-foot-tall megalith\ndesigned to walk across land and stand vertically; or this 4,000-pound behemoth\nthat springs itself to life to dance onstage. And what I've found is\nthat by thinking of architecture not as an end product but as a performance from conception to completion, we end up rediscovering some really smart\nways to build things today. You know, so much of the discussion\nsurrounding our future focuses on technology,\nefficiency and speed. But if I've learned anything from Cyclops, it's that wonders\ncan be smart, spectacular and sustainable -- because of their mass and their mystery. And while people still want to know\nhow those ancient wonders were built, I've been asking Cyclops\nhow to create the mystery that compels people\nto ask that very question. Because in an era\nwhere we design buildings to last 30, maybe 60 years, I would love to learn\nhow to create something that could entertain for an eternity. Thank you.

Travel backwards in time and it might’ve been submerged at \nthe bottom of a shallow sea, buried under miles of rock, or floating through a molten, \ninfernal landscape. But go back far enough— about 4.6 billion years, and you’d be in the middle of an enormous \ncloud of dust and gas orbiting a newborn star. This is the setting for some of the \nbiggest, smallest mysteries of physics: the mysteries of cosmic dust bunnies. Seemingly empty regions \nof space between stars actually contain clouds of gas and dust, usually blown there by supernovas. When a dense cloud reaches a certain \nthreshold called the Jeans mass, it collapses in on itself. The shrinking cloud rotates faster \nand faster, and heats up, eventually becoming hot enough to burn \nhydrogen in its core. At this point a star is born. As fusion begins in the new star, it sends out jets of gas that blow \noff the top and bottom of the cloud, leaving behind an orbiting ring of gas \nand dust called a protoplanetary disk. This is a surprisingly windy place; eddies of gas carry particles apart, \nand send them smashing into each other. The dust consists of tiny metal fragments,\nbits of rock, and, further out, ices. We’ve observed thousands of these disks \nin the sky, at various stages of development as dust clumps together\ninto larger and larger masses. Dust grains 100 times smaller than the \nwidth of a human hair stick to each other through what’s called \nthe van der Waals force. That’s where a cloud of electrons \nshifts to one side of a molecule, creating a negative charge on one end, \nand a positive charge on the other. Opposites attract, but van der Waals can \nonly hold tiny things together. And there’s a problem: once dust \nclusters grow to a certain size, the windy atmosphere of a disk should \nconstantly break them up as they crash into each other. The question of how they continue to grow\nis the first mystery of dust bunnies. One theory looks to electrostatic charge \nto answer this. Energetic gamma rays, x-rays, \nand UV photons knock electrons off of gas \natoms within the disk, creating positive ions \nand negative electrons. Electrons run into and stick to dust, making it negatively charged. Now, when the wind pushes \nclusters together, like repels like \nand slows them down as they collide. With gentle collisions \nthey won’t fragment, but if the repulsion is too strong, \nthey’ll never grow. One theory suggests that high energy \nparticles can knock more electrons off of some \ndust clumps, leaving them positively charged. Opposites again attract, \nand clusters grow rapidly. But before long we reach \nanother set of mysteries. We know from evidence found in meteorites that these fluffy dust bunnies \neventually get heated, melted and then cooled into solid \npellets called chondrules. And we have no idea how \nor why that happens. Furthermore, once those pellets do form,\nhow do they stick together? The electrostatic forces from before \nare too weak, and small rocks can’t be held together \nby gravity either. Gravity increases proportionally to the \nmass of the objects involved. That’s why you could effortlessly escape \nan asteroid the size of a small mountain using just the force generated \nby your legs. So if not gravity, then what? Perhaps it’s dust. A fluffy dust rim collected around the \noutside of the pellets could act like Velcro. There’s evidence for this in meteors, where we find many chondrules surrounded\nby a thin rim of very fine material– possibly condensed dust. Eventually the chondrule pellets get \ncemented together inside larger rocks, which at about 1 kilometer across are finally large enough to hold \nthemselves together through gravity. They continue to collide and grow \ninto larger and larger bodies, including the planets we know today. Ultimately, the seeds of \neverything familiar– the size of our planet, its position \nwithin the solar system, and its elemental composition– were determined by an uncountably large \nseries of random collisions. Change the dust cloud just a bit, and perhaps the conditions wouldn’t \nhave been right for the formation of life on our planet."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long ago did our solar system form?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "460 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4,600 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4.6 million years ago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4.6 billion years ago"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A star is born when", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A gas cloud become dense enough to collapse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A collapsing dust cloud becomes hot enough to burn hydrogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jets blow away the free gas and dust in a dust cloud"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Supernovas blow gas and dust together into a big pile"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Tiny dust particles stick together through", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Velcro-like adhesives"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Van Der Waals forces"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The strong force"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How big does an object have to grow before it can be held together by gravity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1 km – about the size of an asteroid"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1 m – about the size of a meteoroid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10,000 km – about the size of the Earth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1000 km – about the size of a dwarf planet"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The dust in a protoplanetary disk becomes charged by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Collecting electrons from the ionized gas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Collecting ions from the ionized gas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Energetic photons knocking electrons off the dust"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Orpheus, \ncharmer of nature and master of music. Castor and Pollux, \nthe twin tricksters hatched from an egg. The Boreads, \nsons of the North Wind who could hurtle through the air. For untold times \nthese heroes had roamed ancient Greece, creating new legends wherever they went. But none of their adventures \nwas so great as when they joined forces for the sake of a young man named Jason. Years before, Jason’s uncle Pelias \nhad ruthlessly usurped the throne of Thessaly \nfrom Jason’s grandfather. When Jason returned \nto his father’s stolen court, the cowardly king \nset him a seemingly impossible task: cross the teeming seas to Colchis, and steal \nthe golden fleece of a flying ram under King Aeetes’ nose. If Jason retrieved the Fleece, Pelias promised to relinquish the throne. Touched by his heroic mission, the Gods spread Jason’s call for help, and soon \nhe had assembled a not-so-motley crew. These heroes, alongside countless sailors,\nsoothsayers, and rebel demigods, named themselves \nthe Argonauts after their sturdy ship. But the path ahead \nwas marked with untold terrors– enough to test even the fiercest heroes. Their first stop was Lemnos, an isle of women \nwho had killed all the island’s men. As punishment, Aphrodite had cursed them\nwith a sickening stench– but that didn’t stop Jason \nfathering twins with the queen. The rest of the crew also found themselves\nembroiled in new romances; until Hercules chastised them \nfor not behaving like heroes. Eventually, \nthey sailed on to the Mount of Bears, an island where a group of ancient, \nsix-armed monsters lived alongside the peaceful Doliones. While the clan welcomed \nthe Argonauts with open arms, the monsters surged down \nfrom the mountains and hurled rocks at the docked ship. Hercules held them off single-handedly, before his comrades joined the fray. Bolstered by their victory, \nthe triumphant heroes sailed onward– only to be blown back \nto the island several stormy nights later. In the tempest, the Doliones \nthought these new arrivals invaders. The Argonauts were similarly unaware \nof their surroundings, and fought blunderingly in the dark, \nslaying wave after wave of foe. But the morning light \nrevealed a horrible truth: their victims \nwere none other than their previous hosts. Yet again, Jason had allowed the crew \nto be distracted, this time at a terrible cost. Ashamed at his conduct, he resolved \nto focus only on the Fleece, but even this haste proved ruinous. When Hercules’ squire \nwas abducted by a water nymph, Jason sailed on– oblivious to the absence \nof his most powerful crewmate. The remaining Argonauts \ncontinued their quest, until stopping at the sight of an old man \nsurrounded by a swirl of harpies. This was Phineas, \na seer cursed by Zeus to endure \nold age, blindness, and endless torture for giving away \nhis prophecies. Moved by his plight, \nthe wind brothers set upon the flock, providing Phineas \nwith a brief respite from his punishment. In return, the seer told them how to overcome\nthe terrifying trial that lay ahead: the Symplegades, a pair clashing rocks \nthat reduced ships to splinters. But first, the Argonauts would have to maneuver \npast the mouth of hell, around the island \nof the bloodthirsty Amazons, and under psychedelic skies. These adventures cost the crew \nboth in men and morale– and some feared \nthey might be losing their minds. Upon reaching the clashing rocks, \nthe exhausted crew quaked with fear. But Phineas’ advice rang in their heads. The Argonauts released a single dove and sped through in its wake \nto emerge unscathed. With this narrow escape, the Argonauts \nfinally had Colchis in their sights. Yet while Jason rested \nand celebrated with his crew, he could feel his time \namong them was drawing to a close.

The year is 1676, and the Treaty of \nŻurawno has officially ended hostilities between the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\nand the Ottoman Empire. But as Stepan and his men ride \ntowards their stronghold, peace is far from their minds. Having made their home in the Wild Fields \nnorth of the Black Sea, these cossacks— derived from a Turkic \nword for \"free man\"— are renowned as one of Europe’s most \nformidable military forces. Composed of hunters, fishermen, \nnomads and outlaws, the Cossacks found freedom in these \nfertile unclaimed lands. Yet this freedom has proven increasingly \ndifficult to maintain. Their decades-long strategy of shifting \nalliances between Poland and Moscow has led to the partitioning \nof their lands. In a desperate bid to reclaim independence\nand reunite the fractured Cossack state, their most recent leader, hetman Petro \nDoroshenko allied with the Ottoman Empire. This alliance successfully freed the \nZaporozhian Cossacks in the west from Polish dominion, but \ntheir victory was a bitter one. Doroshenko’s Ottoman allies \nravaged the countryside, carrying off peasants into slavery. And outrage at allying with Muslims \nagainst fellow Christians cost him any remaining local support. Now, with Doroshenko deposed and exiled, the Cossacks are at odds, disagreeing \non what their next move should be. Until then, Stepan must keep order. With his musket and curved saber, \nhe cuts an imposing figure. He surveys his battalion of 180 men. Most are Orthodox Christians \nand speak a Slavic language that will become modern Ukrainian. But there are also Greeks, Tatars, \nand even some Mongolian Kalmyks, many with different opinions \non recent events. Officially, all of Stepan’s men have \nsworn to uphold the Cossack code by undergoing seven years of military \ntraining and remaining unmarried. In practice, some are part-timers, holding\nmore closely to their own traditions, and maintaining families in nearby \nvillages, outside Cossack lands. Thankfully, the tenuous peace is not \nbroken before they reach the Sich— the center of Cossack military life. Currently located at Chortomlyk, the Sich’s location shifts with \nthe tide of military action. The settlement is remarkably well-\norganized, with administrative buildings, officers’ quarters, and even schools, \nas Cossacks prize literacy. Stepan and his men make their way \nto the barracks where they live and train alongside several other \nbattalions or kurins, all of which make up a several \nhundred man regiment. Inside, the men dine on dried fish, \nsheep’s cheese, and salted pork fat— along with plenty of wine. Stepan instructs his friend Yuri to \nlighten the mood with his bandura. But before long, an argument \nhas broken out. One of his men has raised \na toast to Doroshenko. Stepan cuts him off. The room is silent until he raises \nhis own toast to Ivan Sirko, the new hetman who favors an alliance \nwith Moscow against the Turks. Stepan plans to support him, and \nhe expects his men to do the same. Suddenly, one of Sirko’s men rushes in, calling an emergency Rada, \nor general council meeting. Stepan and the others make their \nway towards the church square— the center of Sich life. Ivan Sirko welcomes the confused \ncrowd with exciting news— scouts have located a large Ottoman \ncamp completely vulnerable on one side. Sirko vows that tomorrow, they will \nride against their common enemy, defend the Cossacks’ autonomy, \nand bring unity to the Wild Fields. As the men cheer in unison, Stepan is relieved at their renewed \nsense of brotherhood. Over the next 200 years, these \nfreedom fighters would take on many foes. And tragically, they would eventually become the \noppressive hand of the Russian government they once opposed. But today, these 17th century Cossacks are remembered for their spirit of \nindependence and defiance. As the Russian painter \nIlya Repin once said: “No people in the world held freedom, \nequality, and fraternity so deeply.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the linguistic origin of the word ‘cossack’?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Slavic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Turkic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Germanic"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is a cossack leader called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "hetman"}, {"label": "B", "text": "tsar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "khan"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The cossacks spoke a precursor to what modern-day language?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Russian"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ukrainian"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Polish"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the name of a cossack battalion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "horde"}, {"label": "B", "text": "legion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "kurin"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who did Ivan Sirko favor an alliance with?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Russia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Poland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Ottoman Empire"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

You change direction \nbut the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance \nwith death just before dawn. Why? Because this storm isn't something \nthat blew in from far away… This storm is you.\nSomething inside of you.” This quote, from the first chapter \nof Haruki Murakami’s \"Kafka on the Shore,\" captures the teenage protagonist's \nturmoil. Desperate to escape his tyrannical father and the family curse \nhe feels doomed to repeat, he renames himself Kafka \nafter his favorite author and runs away from home. But memories of a missing mother, along with dreams \nthat haunt his waking life, prove more difficult to outrun. Published in Japanese in 2002 and translated into English \nthree years later, \"Kafka on the Shore\" \nis an epic literary puzzle filled with time travel, hidden histories,\nand magical underworlds. Readers delight in discovering \nhow the mind-bending imagery, whimsical characters \nand eerie coincidences fit together. Kafka narrates every second chapter, with the rest centering on an old man \nnamed Satoru Nakata. After awakening from a coma \nhe went into during the Second World War, Nakata loses \nthe ability to read and write– but gains a mysterious knack \nfor talking to cats. When he’s asked to tail a missing pet, he’s thrown onto a dangerous path \nthat runs parallel to Kafka’s. Soon prophecies come true, \nportals to different dimensions open up– and fish and leeches \nbegin raining from the sky. But what ties these two characters \ntogether– and is it a force \neither one of them can control? The collision of different worlds\nis a common thread in Haruki Murakami’s work. His novels and short stories \noften forge fantastic connections between personal experience, supernatural possibilities, \nand Japanese history. Born in Kyoto in 1949, Murakami grew up \nduring the post-World War II American occupation of Japan. The shadow of war \nhung over his life as it does his fiction; \"Kafka on the Shore\" \nfeatures biological attacks, military ghosts and shady conspiracies. Murakami’s work blurs historical periods and draws \nfrom multiple cultural traditions. References to Western society \nand Japanese customs tumble over each other, from literature and fashion \nto food and ghost stories. He has a penchant \nfor musical references, too, especially in \"Kafka on the Shore.\" As the runaway Kafka \nwanders the streets of a strange city, Led Zeppelin and Prince keep him company. Soon, he takes refuge \nin an exquisite private library. While he spends his days \nporing over old books and contemplating a strange painting \nand the library’s mysterious owner, he also befriends the librarian– who introduces him \nto classical music like Schubert. This musical sensibility \nmakes Murakami’s work all the more hypnotic. He frequently bends the line \nbetween reality and a world of dreams, and is considered a master \nof magic lurking in the mundane. This is a key feature of magical realism. In contrast to fantasy, magic in this sort of writing \nrarely offers a way out of a problem. Instead, it becomes just one more thing\nthat complicates life. In \"Kafka on the Shore,\" characters are faced with \nendless otherworldly distractions, from a love sick ghost \nto a flute made from cat souls. These challenges offer no easy answers. Instead, they leave us \nmarveling at the resourcefulness of the human spirit \nto deal with the unexpected. While Kafka \noften seems suspended in strangeness, there’s a tenderness and integrity \nat the heart of his mission that keeps him moving forward. Gradually he comes \nto accept his inner confusion. In the end, \nhis experience echoes the reader’s: the deeper you go, the more you find."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The boy who renames himself Kafka runs away from home because he:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Committed a crime"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Is following a lost cat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Is trying to outrun a curse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wants to find his long-lost father"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is Satoru Nakata’s magic power?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Talking to dogs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Talking to cats"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sending people to sleep"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Time travel"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Cultural references in Kafka on the Shore include", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pop music"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Clothing brands"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Classical music"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Food"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "When he runs away from home, Kafka takes refuge", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In an abandoned hotel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In an old library"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In a school"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In a restaurant"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Kafka on the Shore draws extensively on historical events, including the second world war and biological warfare", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

ask is why is the ocean so salty to begin with well it wasn't always like that about 3.8 billion years ago Earth's surface had finally cooled to the point that water vapour turned to liquid no salt added that's right a really really long time ago the oceans were freshwater but that wasn't going to last whenever it rains carbon dioxide from the air dissolves into the falling water this makes the rain slightly acidic and when it falls it causes rocks to erode from there rainwater slides towards nearby rivers and streams taking loose salt and minerals along with it from there this runoff flows from rivers into the ocean add to that any additional salt and minerals that would be expelled from hydrothermal vents or submarine volcanoes and then consider that this whole process has been recurring more or less consistently for 3.8 billion years that's a lot of salt in fact there's so much salt in the ocean that if you spread it evenly across all the land on earth it would amount to

for fresh water doubles every 20 years so maybe fresh water oceans would actually yield a good outcome this time nope a sea without salt would decimate marine life and dramatically affect our weather and temperatures making human life on Earth very difficult if not impossible there are roughly two hundred and twenty eight thousand four hundred and fifty species in the ocean and as many as two million more to be discovered but if the ocean were to become desalinated we'd never find them saltwater fish and other ocean creatures evolved to be able to drink salt water to stay hydrated and get rid of excess salt not all sea creatures do this the same way but being able to pump out excess salt is crucial to surviving in the ocean some species like salmon have adapted to tolerate freshwater and saltwater but for the most part all saltwater species would perish this includes underwater algae which believe it or not accounts for half the photosynthesis that occurs on earth photosynthesis plays a vital role in supplying our planet with oxygen since trees and plants convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into the air we breathe so without algae not only do we get less oxygen we also have a lot more carbon dioxide in our atmosphere this intensification of the greenhouse effect would make some parts of the world unbearably hot you definitely notice this intense heat near the equator since our ocean currents wouldn't be circulating warm water and air the way they used to convection currents help warm water from the equator get farther north while colder water from the north is able to cool hotter areas down south at the equator warmer water can carry more salt so this denser water sinks lower while cooler water flows over top of it and in the far north the water gets cold enough to freeze and form sea ice salt gets left behind as the water freezes and naturally this makes colder water up north denser allowing it to sink to the bottom to make room for the incoming warmer water that's worked its way up from the south but without salt the whole process breaks down Earth's extremities would freeze while weather around the equator would intensify for one thing hurricanes would be a lot more frequent and a lot more deadly at this point our weather and our climate would be totally different from how we know it now how long would we survive to see all these changes not long at all you'd either freeze over heat die in a natural disaster or starve to death yeah with significantly less photosynthesis and climates that are either extremely cold or extremely hot our weather would no longer support the diverse plant life that has now the entire food chain would collapse most species would die off including humans since crops we rely on for sustenance would all disappear so when we say ocean salinization is important don't take it with a grain of salt of course we respect the scientific method so keep questioning the world and its properties on land and beyond and come back soon for another what-if [Music]"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What makes the ocean salty?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It's naturally

To have even a chance of doing so, we have to control the environment \nprecisely: the thick tabletop and legs guard against\nvibrations from footsteps, nearby elevators, and opening\nor closing doors. The cylinder is a vacuum chamber, devoid of all the gases in air. Inside the vacuum chamber is a smaller, extremely cold compartment, \nreachable by tiny laser beams. Inside are ultra-sensitive particles\nthat make up a quantum computer. So what makes these particles \nworth the effort? In theory, quantum computers could \noutstrip the computational limits of classical computers. Classical computers process \ndata in the form of bits. Each bit can switch between two states \nlabeled zero and one. A quantum computer uses something \ncalled a qubit, which can switch between zero, one, \nand what’s called a superposition. While the qubit is in its superposition, it has a lot more information \nthan one or zero. You can think of these positions as \npoints on a sphere: the north and south poles of the sphere \nrepresent one and zero. A bit can only switch between \nthese two poles, but when a qubit is in its superposition, it can be at any point on the sphere. We can’t locate it exactly— the moment we read it, the qubit resolves \ninto a zero or a one. But even though we can’t observe the \nqubit in its superposition, we can manipulate it to perform \nparticular operations while in this state. So as a problem grows more complicated, a classical computer needs correspondingly\nmore bits to solve it, while a quantum computer will \ntheoretically be able to handle more and more complicated problems without requiring as many more qubits as a\nclassical computer would need bits. The unique properties of quantum computers result from the behavior of atomic \nand subatomic particles. These particles have quantum states, which correspond to the \nstate of the qubit. Quantum states are incredibly fragile, easily destroyed by temperature \nand pressure fluctuations, stray electromagnetic fields, and collisions with nearby particles. That’s why quantum computers need \nsuch an elaborate set up. It’s also why, for now, the power of quantum computers \nremains largely theoretical. So far, we can only control a few qubits \nin the same place at the same time. There are two key components involved in managing these fickle quantum \nstates effectively: the types of particles a quantum \ncomputer uses, and how it manipulates those particles. For now, there are two leading approaches: trapped ions and superconducting qubits. A trapped ion quantum computer uses \nions as its particles and manipulates them with lasers. The ions are housed in a trap made \nof electrical fields. Inputs from the lasers tell the ions what \noperation to make by causing the qubit state \nto rotate on the sphere. To use a simplified example, the lasers could input the question: what are the prime factors of 15? In response, the ions may release photons— the state of the qubit determines whether\nthe ion emits photons and how many photons it emits. An imaging system collects these photons\nand processes them to reveal the answer: 3 and 5. Superconducting qubit quantum computers\ndo the same thing in a different way: using a chip with electrical circuits \ninstead of an ion trap. The states of each electrical circuit \ntranslate to the state of the qubit. They can be manipulated with electrical\ninputs in the form of microwaves. So: the qubits come from either ions \nor electrical circuits, acted on by either lasers or microwaves. Each approach has advantages \nand disadvantages. Ions can be manipulated very precisely, and they last a long time, but as more ions are added to a trap, it becomes increasingly difficult to \ncontrol each with precision. We can’t currently contain enough ions \nin a trap to make advanced computations, but one possible solution might be to \nconnect many smaller traps that communicate with each \nother via photons rather than trying to create one big trap. Superconducting circuits, meanwhile, make\noperations much faster than trapped ions, and it’s easier to scale up the number \nof circuits in a computer than the number of ions. But the circuits are also more fragile, and have a shorter overall lifespan. And as quantum computers advance, they will still be subject to the \nenvironmental constraints needed to preserve quantum states. But in spite of all these obstacles, we’ve already succeeded at making \ncomputations in a realm we can’t enter or even observe."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What external factors can destroy the information in a quantum computer?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "smells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "footsteps"}, {"label": "C", "text": "elevators"}, {"label": "D", "text": "talking"}, {"label": "E", "text": "unwanted electric and magnetic fields"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What do quantum computers use to encode the information?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bits 0 and 1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Flowers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Qubits (quantum bits)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Atoms and ions"}, {"label": "E", "text": "gravity"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do quantum computers perform operations?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Using microwaves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By emitting sound"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Using lasers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By moving up and down"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Using superposition"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are some promising platforms to implement a quantum computer?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Graphene"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Superconducting circuits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gluons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bosons"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Trapped ions"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why are quantum computers useful?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are not useful"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To check my emails"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can carry out very very complex calculations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To watch movies"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Their performance is better than classical computers"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 18, "lesson": 24, "title": "You are not alone in your loneliness - Jonny Sun", "category": "Emotional Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/cHr2wgTi", "transcript": {"en": "Hello. I'd like to introduce you to someone. This is Jomny. That's \"Jonny\" but spelled\naccidentally with an \"m,\" in case you were wondering, because we're not all perfect. Jomny is an alien who has been sent to earth\nwith a mission to study humans. Jomny is feeling lost and alone\nand far from home, and I think we've all felt this way. Or, at least I have. I wrote this story about this alien\nat a moment in my life when I was feeling particularly alien. I had just moved to Cambridge\nand started my doctoral program at MIT, and I was feeling intimidated and isolated\nand very much like I didn't belong. But I had a lifeline of sorts. See, I was writing jokes\nfor years and years and sharing them on social media, and I found that I was turning\nto doing this more and more. Now, for many people,\nthe internet can feel like a lonely place. It can feel like this, a big, endless, expansive void where you can constantly call out to it\nbut no one's ever listening. But I actually found a comfort\nin speaking out to the void. I found, in sharing\nmy feelings with the void, eventually the void started to speak back. And it turns out that the void\nisn't this endless lonely expanse at all, but instead it's full of\nall sorts of other people, also staring out into it\nand also wanting to be heard. Now, there have been many bad things\nthat have come from social media. I'm not trying to dispute that at all. To be online at any given point\nis to feel so much sadness and anger and violence. It can feel like the end of the world. Yet, at the same time, I'm conflicted because I can't deny the fact\nthat so many of my closest friends are people that I had met\noriginally online. And I think that's partly because\nthere's this confessional nature to social media. It can feel like you are writing\nin this personal, intimate diary that's completely private, yet at the same time you want\neveryone in the world to read it. And I think part of that, the joy of that is that we get to experience things\nfrom perspectives from people who are completely\ndifferent from ourselves, and sometimes that's a nice thing. For example, when I first joined Twitter, I found that so many of the people\nthat I was following were talking about mental health\nand going to therapy in ways that had none of the stigma\nthat they often do when we talk about these issues in person. Through them, the conversation\naround mental health was normalized, and they helped me realize\nthat going to therapy was something that would help me as well. Now, for many people, it sounds like a scary idea\nto be talking about all these topics so publicly and so openly on the internet. I feel like a lot of people\nthink that it is a big, scary thing to be online if you're not\nalready perfectly and fully formed. But I think the internet can be\nactually a great place to not know, and I think we can\ntreat that with excitement, because to me there's something\nimportant about sharing your imperfections and your insecurities\nand your vulnerabilities with other people. (Laughter) Now, when someone shares\nthat they feel sad or afraid or alone, for example, it actually makes me feel less alone, not by getting rid of any of my loneliness but by showing me that I am not alone in feeling lonely. And as a writer and as an artist, I care very much about making\nthis comfort of being vulnerable a communal thing, something that we\ncan share with each other. I'm excited about\nexternalizing the internal, about taking those invisible personal\nfeelings that I don't have words for, holding them to the light,\nputting words to them, and then sharing them with other people in the hopes that it might help them\nfind words to find their feelings as well. Now, I know that sounds like a big thing, but ultimately I'm interested\nin putting all these things into small, approachable packages, because when we can hide them\ninto these smaller pieces, I think they are easier to approach,\nI think they're more fun. I think they can more easily help us\nsee our shared humanness. Sometimes that takes the form\nof a short story, sometimes that takes the form of\na cute book of illustrations, for example. And sometimes that takes the form of a silly joke\nthat I'll throw on the internet. For example, a few months ago,\nI posted this app idea for a dog-walking service where a dog shows up at your door\nand you have to get out of the house and go for a walk. (Laughter) If there are app developers\nin the audience, please find me after the talk. Or, I like to share every time\nI feel anxious about sending an email. When I sign my emails \"Best,\" it's short for \"I am trying my best,\" which is short for \"Please don't hate me,\nI promise I'm trying my best!\" Or my answer to the classic icebreaker, if I could have dinner with anyone,\ndead or alive, I would. I am very lonely. (Laughter) And I find that when\nI post things like these online, the reaction is very similar. People come together to share a laugh, to share in that feeling, and then to disburse just as quickly. (Laughter) Yes, leaving me once again alone. But I think sometimes these\nlittle gatherings can be quite meaningful. For example, when I graduated\nfrom architecture school and I moved to Cambridge, I posted this question: \"How many people in your life\nhave you already had your last conversation with?\" And I was thinking about\nmy own friends who had moved away to different cities\nand different countries, even, and how hard it would be\nfor me to keep in touch with them. But other people started replying\nand sharing their own experiences. Somebody talked about a family member\nthey had a falling out with. Someone talked about a loved one\nwho had passed away quickly and unexpectedly. Someone else talked\nabout their friends from school who had moved away as well. But then something really nice\nstarted happening. Instead of just replying to me, people started replying to each other, and they started to talk to each other\nand share their own experiences and comfort each other and encourage each other\nto reach out to that friend that they hadn't spoken to in a while or that family member\nthat they had a falling out with. And eventually, we got\nthis little tiny microcommunity. It felt like this support group formed of all sorts of people coming together. And I think every time we post online, every time we do this, there's a chance that these little\nmicrocommunities can form. There's a chance that all sorts\nof different creatures can come together and be drawn together. And sometimes, through\nthe muck of the internet, you get to find a kindred spirit. Sometimes that's\nin the reading the replies and the comments sections and finding\na reply that is particularly kind or insightful or funny. Sometimes that's\nin going to follow someone and seeing that they\nalready follow you back. And sometimes that's in looking at someone\nthat you know in real life and seeing the things that you write\nand the things that they write and realizing that you share so many\nof the same interests as they do, and that brings them\ncloser together to you. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you get to meet another alien. [when two aliebns find each other\nin a strange place, it feels a litle more like home] But I am worried, too,\nbecause as we all know, the internet for the most part\ndoesn't feel like this. We all know that for the most part, the internet feels like a place\nwhere we misunderstand each other, where we come into conflict\nwith each other, where there's all sorts of confusion\nand screaming and yelling and shouting, and it feels like\nthere's too much of everything. It feels like chaos, and I don't know how to square away\nthe bad parts with the good, because as we know and as we've seen, the bad parts can really, really hurt us. It feels to me that the platforms\nthat we use to inhabit these online spaces have been designed\neither ignorantly or willfully to allow for harassment and abuse,\nto propagate misinformation, to enable hatred and hate speech\nand the violence that comes from it, and it feels like\nnone of our current platforms are doing enough\nto address and to fix that. But still, and maybe\nprobably unfortunately, I'm still drawn to these online spaces,\nas many others are, because sometimes it just feels\nlike that's where all the people are. And I feel silly and stupid sometimes for valuing these small moments\nof human connection in times like these. But I've always operated under this idea that these little moments of humanness\nare not superfluous. They're not retreats\nfrom the world at all, but instead they're the reasons\nwhy we come to these spaces. They are important and vital\nand they affirm and they give us life. And they are these tiny,\ntemporary sanctuaries that show us that we are not\nas alone as we think we are. And so yes, even though life is bad\nand everyone's sad and one day we're all going to die -- [look. life is bad. everyones sad. We're all gona die, but i alredy bought\nthis inflatable bouncey castle so are u gona take Ur shoes off or not] I think the inflatable metaphorical\nbouncy castle in this case is really our relationships\nand our connections to other people. And so one night, when I was feeling particularly sad\nand hopeless about the world, I shouted out to the void, to the lonely darkness. I said, \"At this point,\nlogging on to social media feels like holding someone's hand\nat the end of the world.\" And this time, instead of\nthe void responding, it was people who showed up, who started replying to me and then\nwho started talking to each other, and slowly this little\ntiny community formed. Everybody came together to hold hands. And in these dangerous and unsure times, in the midst of it all, I think the thing that we have\nto hold on to is other people. And I know that is a small thing\nmade up of small moments, but I think it is one tiny,\ntiny sliver of light in all the darkness. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
