But what started out as a celebration \nled to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases \nof meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia\nand the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a\nwave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of\nthousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation \nof the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for \nprotecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous\ncompared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which\nit invades a person’s body. In the worst cases, it causes death \nwithin a day. Fortunately, that’s rare for patients\nwho receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily \ncomes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial--\nthe last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on. People usually contract bacterial \nmeningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and \nsaliva that spray into the air when an infected person \nsneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted \nthrough kissing, or sharing cigarettes, \ntoothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected \nand carry the disease without showing symptoms\nor getting sick, which helps the disease\nspread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter \nthe nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding \nmembranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have \nrapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane\ncalled the blood-brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which\nseparate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except\nfor a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are \nstill trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick\nthe barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly\ninfect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body’s \nimmune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever\nand intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens,\nthe neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its\nnormal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss \nand extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium, \nit may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks\nof the disease. A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying\nbacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia,\nalso known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what\nstarts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots \nbeneath the skin. At the same time, these toxins\nburn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to \nmajor organs like the lungs and kidneys. That increases the chance \nof organ shut down --and alongside spreading \nsepticemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so\ngood at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically\nreduce an adult’s risk of dying from it. The longer it’s left \nuntreated, though, the more likely it will lead\nto lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell\ndeath in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs--\nthe risk of amputation goes up. And if bacterial toxins accumulate\nin the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term\nbrain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment, or better yet, \nprevention, is critical. That's why most countries have\nvaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who\nare most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, \nor people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis \ncould potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in\na region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases\ndo happen all over the world. If you’re concerned that you or someone \nyou know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Meningitis can be caused by many different germs.

{"page": 23, "lesson": 3, "title": "7 organs you could live without", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/QE1AlTTO", "transcript": {"en": "[♪ INTRO] The human body is an incredibly complex machine\nmade up of systems of organs all working together to keep things humming along smoothly. So you’d think that taking anything out\nwould make the whole thing break down. But of course, lots of people live without\nsome of their organs. Like, you’re better off without an appendix\nif it’s giving you a problem, for example. And you can afford to lose all kinds of more\nimportant organs, too, like a giant chunk of your liver or even an entire lung. Because yeah, your body is a finely tuned\nmachine — if you don’t mind me saying so — but it also has a bunch of redundancies\nthat allow it to adapt to some pretty extreme changes. So here are just a few of the bits you can\nlive without. Number one, the brain. You didn’t think we were gonna go there! Of all of the organs in the human body to\nlose, even partially, you would think that the brain would be a total dealbreaker. I mean, it controls or coordinates basically\neverything else. But it turns out that sometimes, it’s better\nto live with just one hemisphere — half a brain, in other words. Like when people have a kind of epilepsy where\nseizures stem from one side of the brain. This can happen with some developmental brain\ndisorders, or with rare conditions like when one brain hemisphere is abnormally large. One-sided seizures are often difficult to\ntreat, and they can be debilitating. So sometimes doctors recommend a hemispherectomy:\nthe removal of some or all of the half of the brain that’s affected. It’s a very rare, extreme operation, obviously,\nbut when it’s successful, it can result in a relatively normal life. After a hemispherectomy, between 50-90% of\npatients become completely seizure free. They do experience some paralysis in the half\nof the body normally controlled by the missing brain hemisphere, but most are still able\nto walk if they could before the procedure. And the surgery doesn’t usually result in\ncognitive deficits, either. Younger patients tend to have fewer side effects\nbecause the remaining healthy hemisphere is still developing, allowing it to compensate\nfor what’s missing. Still, it’s a difficult procedure with major\nrisks, so doctors don’t just chop out half of somebody’s brain without carefully weighing\nother options. But the idea that you can lose half of your\nbrain and still be alive at all is pretty incredible. You might even say it’s … mind-blowing. Breathing is another thing that’s kind of\nessential for human life, so you would think that losing a lung would cause a lot of problems. But you can get by just fine with just one\nlung. Lung diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary\ndisease, cancer, or tuberculosis can wreck someone’s lung tissues. So in some cases, part of a lung or even the\nentire lung will be removed in a surgery called a pneumonectomy. When one lung is removed, the extra space\nallows other organs to shift a bit, giving the remaining lung some more room to expand. Studies have shown that in some animals like\ndogs and rats, the remaining lung can actually grow new alveoli—the little sacs where gas\nexchange happens. It’s thought that children who get a pneumonectomy\nmight also do this since their lungs are still developing. But in adults, it’s more likely that the\nalveoli just stretch and expand a little to move more air through. Ultimately, one lung is able to do about 70-80%\nof what two lungs can, and that is usually enough. Depending on age and other health factors,\nit might be a bit more difficult to do strenuous activities, but some people who have had this\nsurgery go on to run marathons, which is more than I can say for me. Your stomach has to be tough enough to mush\naround your meals in gastric acid before passing them along to the small intestine. So it’s fairly resilient. But it can still become impaired or diseased\nto the point that the patient needs surgery to redirect the digestive tract around their\nstomach or to remove part of it. And in some cases, surgeons perform a total\ngastrectomy to take out the whole thing and just connect the esophagus directly to\nthe small intestine. Oddly enough, this doesn’t really affect\nthe overall process of digestion since most of it occurs in the small intestine anyway. But since there is no stomach to store food\nin, patients often need to eat smaller, more frequent meals. Sometimes they also need additional vitamin\nsupplements for things that aren’t absorbed well by the small intestine, like vitamin\nB12 or vitamin D. And some patients might develop a side effect\ncalled dumping syndrome, which, no, does not refer to the ‘dumping’ that you may be\nthinking of right now. Sugars and starches are usually digested in\nthe stomach, but after a gastrectomy, they “dump” straight into the small intestine. Since the intestine isn’t used to that,\nit recruits water to help break those things down, and a lot of that water comes from your\nblood, causing a drop in blood pressure. With dumping syndrome, that can cause all\nkinds of unpleasant symptoms after a meal: cramping and bloating, nausea, weakness, dizziness,\nand low blood pressure. But generally, dietary changes are enough\nto overcome these issues, and people without a stomach get enough calories to go back to\ntheir lives. The spleen, which sits to the left of the\nstomach, is also a pretty useful organ. It’s involved in filtering blood, including\nremoving and breaking down old red blood cells, and it’s one of the places where infection-fighting\nwhite blood cells are produced. But when bad things happen to someone’s\nabdomen—like if they get shot or stabbed or get in a motorcycle accident like my father-in-law,\nthe spleen can rupture. That’s super dangerous because it can result\nin internal bleeding that could be fatal. The spleen can also cause problems if it becomes\nenlarged from an infection, because the swelling can trap and destroy healthy blood cells,\nleading to anemia. In those cases, doctors will do a splenectomy,\nwhere they remove part or all of the spleen. It’s typically considered a safe procedure,\nbut because of its role in the immune system, people without a spleen are more prone to\ninfections, especially from certain bacteria. So for people without spleens, it’s important\nfor them to boost their immune system by taking preventative antibiotics and staying vaccinated. But the redundancy of the human body means\nthe immune system isn’t completely destroyed. And the liver can pick up the slack when it\ncomes to filtering blood. Speaking of which… Your liver does a lot—it processes nutrients,\ndetoxifies your blood, and produces bile, a fluid that helps digestion. And yet, while you can’t have your whole\nliver removed, you can donate more than half of it to help someone whose liver is diseased. What’s really amazing, though, is that unlike\nyour other organs, your liver will grow back. Your liver is made of hepatocytes, specialized\ncells that don’t actively replicate…that is, until some are missing. When a piece of liver is removed, hepatocytes\nreactivate and start replicating again, growing new liver cells. Liver regeneration is so efficient that you\ncan lose up to 65% of your liver and it’ll grow back within a year. Just a quarter of a liver can become a completely\nnew liver in a transplant recipient. Like any major surgery, there are risks and\npotential complications. But if you’re in good health and feeling\naltruistic, liver donation is a thing that you can do and probably be totally fine afterwards. Tucked underneath your liver is a small, pear-shaped\norgan: the gallbladder. Its main job is to store the bile that the\nliver produces until it’s needed for digestion. But sometimes, the components of bile harden\ninto small pebble-like stones, and if those stones become a problem, doctors just yank\nout the whole thing. Bile is mostly made up of cholesterol, bile\nsalts, and a waste compound called bilirubin that’s responsible for the color of your\npoop. In the small intestine, bile’s job is to\nhelp digest fats and break down fat-soluble vitamins like vitamin A and vitamin D. But for reasons that actually aren’t well-understood,\nthe cholesterol and bilirubin in bile can harden into gallstones, which can cause blockages\nin the bile duct, the tube that leads to the small intestine. Problematic gallstones are super painful,\nand without treatment, they can lead to infections and inflammation and even be deadly. Unlike kidney stones, which can often be peed\nout, gallstones don’t exit willingly. Sometimes they can be dissolved with medication,\nbut usually they return after the meds are stopped. So in most cases, the treatment for gallstones\nis to remove the gallbladder entirely by performing a cholecystectomy. This surgery was first performed in 1882. A German surgeon noted that other mammals\ndon’t have a gallbladder, so he figured ours probably wasn’t too important. And he was kind of right. The bile still gets to your small intestine\nwithout it — it just doesn’t get temporarily stored along the way. If your gallbladder is removed and the surgery\ngoes smoothly, usually all you have to show for it is a tiny scar and maybe a little bit\nof extra indigestion. Each of your kidneys is made up of more than\na million filtering units called nephrons, which remove waste and excess fluid from the\nblood. If that doesn’t seem too important to you,\njust imagine what would happen to your house if you couldn’t take out the trash for a\ncouple months. In your body, increased levels of waste can\ncause vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration... The whole body can swell, increasing blood\npressure and imparing breathing. And chemical imbalances from improper fluid\nmanagement can lead to serious issues like bone and muscle loss. Ultimately, kidney failure can be fatal. Yet, you only really need one of your kidneys. Each day, a pair of kidneys filters about\n150 liters of blood to produce about a liter and a half of urine. But even one healthy kidney can do all that\nwork on its own, which is why live kidney donation is a thing. When one kidney is removed, the other kidney’s\nnephrons compensate by getting bigger so they can each do more filtering. It becomes just as effective as two kidneys\nwould be. And weirdly, leaving a bad kidney or even\ntwo inside of you isn’t a problem, either. Recipients don’t always get their faulty\nkidneys removed, so they actually end up living with a total of three kidneys, even though\nonly one is doing all of the work. Obviously, your body works best and is the\nhealthiest when all of the parts are present and functioning. But it is definitely possible to live a healthy\nand relatively normal life without some organs, because the human body is incredibly good\nat adapting to change. Remove an organ or two, and it just takes\nit in stride, it’s like, “I’m gonna be one big lung now, I’m fine!” I mean, it doesn’t look that impressive,\nI don’t think, but it is pretty wonderful, thank you body!

{"page": 23, "lesson": 4, "title": "The quest for the perfect apple", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/VSRvyrLy", "transcript": {"en": "This ad isn’t what you think. It’s not promoting a sports team or a grill\ncompany. It’s for an apple. And unlike those that have dominated the produce\nsection when you were a kid, new breeds like this one have catchy names, logos, and slogans. And are trying to generate buzz before you\ncan buy them. Historically, our produce has gone unbranded. So how did we end up with all these apples? For most of the past century, America’s\niconic apple was that of Snow White. Lipstick red, with shiny skin and a crisp\nwhite interior, a.k.a. “the Red Delicious.” First grown on an orchard in Iowa and originally\nnamed after its founder, when it came out in the late 1800s, it was dubbed “the best\napple of any time” Growers and retail stores loved the Red delicious\nbecause it looked good. It was uniform in size and color, turned red\nbefore it was ripe, and wouldn’t bruise easily. And Americans loved the taste. By the 1980s, close to half of all apples\ngrown in the US were Red Delicious. The trouble is, when you bite into one now,\nit often doesn’t taste great. People complain of mushy flesh and tough skin.\nIts defining characteristic can sometimes be that it has no flavor at all. It takes years and a lot of money to develop\na good tasting apple, but growers were incentivized to cut costs -- at the expense of taste. That is, until one apple proved them all wrong. The Honeycrisp. The honeycrisp is everything that the Red\nDelicious was not. When it came out in market in 1991, after\n30 years of development, it had a refreshing taste, a delicate skin, and a soft, juicy\ncrunch. And even though it can cost more than two\ntimes the average price of apples, consumers then and now are willing to pay a premium\nprice, so much so that it’s now the fifth most produced apple in the US. So the honeycrisp started a sort of revolution\nin the apple industry: Now that people knew expensive, flavor-focused apples would sell,\nbreeders experimented to create tastier, more inventive varieties. And they sought to protect their apples’\ngood names, by patenting their trees and trademarking\ntheir brand names. This process picked up speed after a 1980\nfederal law allowed universities to own and patent their inventions, including apple trees. And research programs for apple breeding took\nadvantage of the new rules. In order to plant these new patented varieties,\ngrowers had to pay up: usually about $1 per patented tree and a portion of sales for use\nof a trademarked name. Plus, each trademarked apple had to pass muster\non firmness, sugar content, blemishes and color. These quality checks mean that even though\nthe trademarked Pink Lady and the generic Cripps Pink originate from the same type of\ntree, they look and taste different — the Pink Lady is held to rigorous trademark standards\nand that is what, the company says, justifies their higher price. Now, not all new apples get trademarked. It is only those that experts believe can\ngarner a premium price. And it can take up to 10 years after securing\na patent and trademark to plant and grow enough trees for commercial production. So while they waited on the fruits of their\nlabor, growers worked on marketing their apple in the hopes finding loyal consumers in a\ncompetitive market. And they’re not alone. Visit your grocery store and you will see\na lot more name brands in the produce section. Branded fruits and vegetables are a growing\ntrend. While not all branded apples will see success\non par with the honeycrisp, there is one that has high hopes. Washington State growers are ramping up production\nof their Cosmic Crisp, an apple that’s both sweet and tart, firm and crisp, and much easier\nto grow than the honeycrisp. They’re trying to get people excited about\ntasting something new and that’s not a bad thing. While we could see higher prices in the future,\nthe fruits and veggies themselves will be objectively better. And consumers will have more options, just\nlike we do with our phones, or our computers, or our cereal. And now, our apples."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How are apples being marketed differently now than in the past?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "creative logos"}, {"label": "B", "text": "catchy names and slogans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "commercial advertising"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which characteristics about the Red Delicious apple made it so popular?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "uniform in size and color"}, {"label": "B", "text": "didn't bruise easily"}, {"label": "C", "text": "it turned red before it was ripe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How long did it take to develop the Honeycrisp Apple?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "35 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "30 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20 year"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "You have trademarked and patented your newest apple creation.

{"page": 23, "lesson": 5, "title": "How kids can help design cities- Mara Mintzer", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/at9sUR8l", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Ekaterina Shipatova\nReviewer: Riaki Poništ Our society routinely makes decisions without consulting\na quarter of the population. We are making choices about land use,\nenergy production, and natural resources without the ideas and the experiences\nof the full community. The car, an inanimate object,\nhas more say of our public policy than this group of citizens. Can you guess which group\nI'm talking about? It's children! I work in urban design, and not surprisingly,\nmost cities are designed by adults, urban planners, architects,\ndevelopers, politicians, and occasionally, a few loud citizens. Rarely do you consider the voices\nof a group of four-year-olds, barely tall enough to reach\nthe podium at city council chambers. But today I'm going to ask you this: What would happen if we asked\nchildren to design our cities? (Laughter) Back in 2009, I was introduced\nto a small group of people, who wanted to start a child-friendly\ncity initiative in Boulder, Colorado. I come from a family\nof civil rights advocates, and I had spent my career\nuntil that point working with low-income\nchildren and families. But I had never heard of a child-friendly\ncity initiative before! So, I figured its purpose\nwould be to address some of the frustrations I had encountered\nas the parent of a young child. Perhaps, we would advocate\nfor more changing tables in restaurants or create indoor play spaces\nfor those cold and rainy days. In other words, make the city\nmore hospitable to children and families. It wasn't until after I committed to this project\nthat I realized I had it all wrong. We wouldn't be designing\nbetter cities for children; children would be designing\nbetter cities for themselves and for the rest of us too. Now, I bet you are skeptical\nabout this idea, and honestly, I was, too. I mean, there must be a reason\nthe voting age is 18. (Laughter) How could children possibly\nunderstand complex ideas, such as the affordable housing crisis or how to develop\na transportation masterplan. And even if they had ideas,\nwouldn't they be childish or unreasonable? Do our cities really need\na park made out of candy? (Laughter) Or a bridge with water\ncannons that fire water onto unsuspecting kayakers below? (Laughter) Well, these concerns sound legitimate, I realized that not including\nchildren in city planning was a bigger design problem. After all, shouldn't we include\nend users in the design process? If we are building a park\nto be largely used by kids, then kids should have a say\nin the park's design! So with all of this in mind we formed a program\ncalled \"Growing Up Boulder,\" and my job is to work\nwith children ages 0 through 18 to come up with innovative\ncity design solutions. How do we do this, you might ask. Let me give you a real example. In 2012, the city of Boulder\ndecided to redesign a large downtown park\nknown as The Civic Area. This space is bounded\nby a farmers market on one end, Boulder Public Library on the other end, and by Boulder Creek,\nwhich runs through the middle. The space needed a new design to better handle the creek's\ninevitable flash floods, restore a sense of safety to the area, and support an expanded farmers market. So from 2012 through 2014, we engaged more than\n200 young people in the process, ranging from pre-school\nthrough high-school students. First, we visited children\nin their classrooms and presented the project: what it was, why their ideas mattered and what would happen\nwith their recommendations. Before we could influence them, we asked children to record their ideas\nbased on their own lived experiences. Then we asked children\nto go on a field trip with us to document what they liked\nand didn't like about the space using photography. Through green picture frames students highlighted\nwhat they liked about the space such as college students\ntubing down the creek. (Laughter) Then they flipped those frames over and used the red side to highlight\nthings they didn't like, such as trash. Our sixth-grade students\nstudied the Civic Area by researching sites with similar\nchallenges from around the world. Then we invited the kids to combine their original ideas\nwith their new inspiration to synthesize solutions\nto improve the space. Each class invited adult planners,\ncity council and community members into the classroom to share\nand discuss their recommendations. Boulder senior urban planner\nstepped over blocks and stuffed animals to explore pre-school students' full-size\nclassroom recreation of the Civic Area. Adult planners marveled\nat the students' ideas as they shared a park constructed\nout of a jelly bracelet - it was supposed\nto be an ice-skating rink - and then public ark constructed\nfrom animal-shaped plastic beads. And while this may seem ridiculous, it isn't so different from the models\nthat architects create. Now, fast-forward four years,\nand I am pleased to report that many of the children's ideas\nare being implemented in the Civic Area. For example, there will be improved\naccess to Boulder Creek so kids can play safely in the water. Lighting in previously dark underpasses, so high-school students can walk home\nsafely after school at night. And separated biking and walking pads, so speeding bikers won't hit\nyoung people as they stroll by the Creek. My daughter and I even skated on a new, child-requested\nice-skating rink last winter. Were all of the kids' ideas\nimplemented at the Civic Area? Of course not! Democracy is a messy process. But just as a reasonable\nand well-informed adult does not expect all\nof her ideas to be utilized, neither does a nine-year-old. We've now been using\nthis process for eight years, and along the way we found\nsome incredible benefits to designing cities with children. First of all, kids think\ndifferently from adults, and that's a good thing. Adults think about constraints: How much time will a project take? How much money will it cost? And how dangerous will it be? In other words, are we going to get sued? (Laughter) It's not that these\nconstraints aren't real, but if we kill off ideas\nfrom the beginning, it limits our creativity\nand dampens the design process. Kids, on the other hand,\nthink about possibilities. For kids, the sky is the limit, literally. When we worked with middle-school students\nto design teen-friendly parks, they drew pictures\nof skydiving, hang gliding, (Laughter) and jumping from jet trampolines\ninto giant foam pits. (Laughter) Some of these sound far-fetched, but the commonalities among the activities\nrevealed an important story. Our adolescents wanted\nthrill-seeking opportunities, which makes perfect sense,\ngiven their developmental stage in life. So our task as connectors\nbetween inspiration and reality was to point them towards activities and equipment that actually\ncould be installed in a park. This is exactly what parks\nin Australia have done with their extensive zip-lines\nand their 30-foot tall climbing towers. When kids dream up a space, they almost always include fun,\nplay and movement in their designs. Now, this is not what adults prioritize. But research shows \nthat fun, play and movement are exactly what adults need\nto stay healthy, too! Who wouldn't enjoy a tree-house\ncontaining a little lending library and comfortable\nbeanbag chairs for reading? Or what about a public art display that sprays paint onto a canvas\neach time you walk up the steps? In addition to fun and play,\nchildren value beauty in their designs. When tasked with designing\ndense affordable housing, kids rejected the blocks\nof identical beige condominiums that so many developers favour, and instead put\nbright colors on everything, from housing to play equipment. They placed flowers\nbetween biking and walking pads and placed benches along the creek, so kids could hang out with their friends\nand enjoy the tranquility of the water, which leads me to nature. Children have a biological need\nto connect with nature, and this shows up in their designs. They want nature right in their backyards,\nnot four blocks away. So they designed communities that incorporate water,\nfruit trees, flowers and animals into their common spaces on sight. This is logical, because five-year-olds today\nare rarely allowed to walk four blocks to access a park by themselves. And nature in one's immediate\nenvironment benefits everyone since it has been shown to have\nrestorative effects for all ages. It may come as a surprise,\nbut we even take into consideration the desires of our littlest citizens,\nbabies and toddlers. From toddlers we learned that the joy of walking comes\nfrom what you discover along the way. When they evaluated the walkability\nof Boulder's 19th Street corridor, toddlers spent long stretches exploring leaves in a ditch\nand sparkles in the side-walk. They reminded us to slow down and design a path where the journey\nis as important as the destination. In addition to trees and plants, kids almost always include\nanimals in their designs. Insects, birds and small mammals figure prominently\ninto children's pictures. Whether it's because\nthey're closer to the ground and can see the grasshoppers\nbetter than we can, or simply because they have a greater\nsense of empathy for other beings, children almost always include\nnon-human species in their ideal worlds. Accross the board, children\nare inclusive in their city-planning. They design for everyone, from their grandmother in a wheelchair to the homeless woman\nthey see sleeping in the park. Children design for living creatures, not for cars, egos or corporations. The last and, perhaps, most\ncompelling discovery we made is that a city friendly to children\nis a city friendly to all. Bogota, Columbia Mayor\nEnrique Peñalosa observed that children are a kind\nof indicator species. If we can build a successful\ncity for children, we will have a successful\ncity for all people. Think about it. Kids can't just hop in a car\nand drive to the store, and most kids can't afford\nan expensive lunch at a nearby cafe. So if we build cities\nthat take into consideration their needs for alternative\nforms of transportation and for cheaper food venues, we meet the needs of many\nother populations, too. The more frequent\nand more affordable bus service, so desired by our youth, also supports the elderly,\nwho wish to live independently after they can no longer drive cars. Teens' recommendations for smooth, protected walking\nand skateboarding paths also support the person in a wheelchair,\nor the parent pushing a new stroller. So to me, all of this has revealed\nsomething important, an important blind spot. If we aren't including\nchildren in our planning, who also aren't we including? Are we listening to people of color,\nimmigrants, the elderly and people with disabilities\nor with reduced incomes? What innovative design solutions\nare we overlooking? Because we aren't hearing\nthe voices of the full community. We can't possibly know the needs and wants\nof other people without asking. That goes for kids and for everyone else. So adults, let's stop thinking\nof our children as future citizens, and instead start valuing them\nfor the citizens they are today. Because our children\nare designing the cities that will make us happier and healthier, cities filled with nature, play, movement,\nsocial connection and beauty. Children are designing the cities\nwe all want to live in. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

After months of detective work, you’ve narrowed your suspects to \none of five people: the mayor, the tailor, the baker, the grocer, or the carpenter. You’ve invited them to dinner \nwith a simple plan: you’ll slip a square of \na rare werewolf antidote into each of their dinners. Unfortunately, your pet goat\njust ate four of the squares, and you only have one left. Luckily, the remaining square is 50 grams, and the minimum effective dose \nis 10 grams. If you can precisely divide the \nsquare into fifths you’ll have just enough \nantidote for everyone. You’ll have to use a laser-cutting tool\nto cut up the square; every other means available to you\nisn’t precise enough. There are 8 points that can act \nas starting or ending points for each cut. To use the device, you’ll\nhave to input pairs of points that tell the laser where to begin \nand end each cut, and then the laser executes\nall the cuts simultaneously. It’s okay to cut the square \ninto as many pieces as you want, as long as you can group them\ninto 10 gram portions. But you can’t fold the square \nor alter it otherwise, and you only get one shot \nat using the laser cutter. The full moon is rising,  and in a moment someone\nwill transform and tear you all apart unless you can cure them first. How can you divide the antidote \ninto perfect fifths, cure the secret werewolf, \nand save everyone? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 When it comes to puzzles that\ninvolve cutting and rearranging, it’s often helpful to actually \ntake a piece of paper and try cutting it up to see what\nyou can get. If we cut BF and DH we’d get fourths,\nbut we need fifths. Maybe there’s a way to shave a bit off\nof a quarter to get exactly one fifth. Cutting BE looks good at first, \nbut that last cut takes a off a quarter of a quarter, leaving us with a portion of 3/16: \njust smaller than a fifth, and not enough to cure a werewolf. What if we started with BE instead? That would also give us a quarter. And is there a way to shave\njust a bit more off? Both DG and CH look promising. If we make one more cut, from A to F, we may start to notice something. With these four cuts—from B to E, \nD to G, F to A, and H to C—we’ve got four triangles and a square in the middle. But the pieces that make \neach triangle can also be rearranged to make a square\nidentical to the middle one. This means that we’ve split\nthe antidote into perfect fifths! What’s interesting about this \nsort of problem is that while it’s possible to solve \nit by starting from the geometry, it’s actually easier to start \nexperimenting and see where that gets you. That wouldn’t be as viable if the square \nhad, say, 24 cut points, but with just 8 there\nare only so many reasonable options. You secretly dose each of the townspeople as the full moon emerges in the sky. And just as you do, \na terrible transformation begins. Then, just as suddenly, it reverses. Your measurements were perfect,  and the people and animals of the \ntown can rest a little easier."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "After your pet eats the four other squares of antidote, how much antidote do you have left?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 grams"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50 grams"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100 grams"}, {"label": "D", "text": "250 grams"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the minimum effective dose of werewolf antidote?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 grams"}, {"label": "B", "text": "50 grams"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100 grams"}, {"label": "D", "text": "250 grams"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who is the secret werewolf?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The mayor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The tailor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The baker"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The grocer"}, {"label": "E", "text": "The carpenter"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What fraction must you divide the square of antidote into?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Halves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thirds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fourths"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fifths"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What kind of pet do you have in this riddle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dog"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pig"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Goat"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Standing on our own planet, you might think you’re just an observer\nof this violent ballet. But in fact, both stars are pulling you \ntowards them. And you’re pulling back, connected across trillions of kilometers by gravity. Gravity is the attractive force \nbetween two objects with mass— any two objects with mass. Which means that every object in the\nuniverse attracts every other object: every star, black hole, human being, smartphone, and atom are all constantly pulling on each other. So why don’t we feel pulled in billions \nof different directions? Two reasons: mass and distance. The original equation describing the \ngravitational force between two objects was written by Isaac Newton in 1687. Scientists’ understanding of gravity has \nevolved since then, but Newton’s Law of Universal Gravitation is still a good approximation \nin most situations. It goes like this: the gravitational force between two \nobjects is equal to the mass of one times the mass of the other, multiplied by a very small number called the gravitational constant, and divided by the distance between them, \nsquared. If you doubled the mass of one of \nthe objects, the force between them would double, too. If the distance between them doubled, the force would be one-fourth as strong. The gravitational force between you and \nthe Earth pulls you towards its center, a force you experience as your weight. Let’s say this force is about 800 Newtons when you’re standing at sea level. If you traveled to the Dead Sea, the force would increase by a tiny \nfraction of a percent. And if you climbed to the top of Mount \nEverest, the force would decrease— but again, by a minuscule amount. Traveling higher would make a bigger dent \nin gravity’s influence, but you won’t escape it. Gravity is generated by variations \nin the curvature of spacetime— the three dimensions of space plus time— which bend around any object \nthat has mass. Gravity from Earth reaches the \nInternational Space Station, 400 kilometers above the earth, with almost its original intensity. If the space station was stationary \non top of a giant column, you’d still experience ninety percent of the gravitational force there \nthat you do on the ground. Astronauts just experience weightlessness because the space station is constantly \nfalling towards earth. Fortunately, it’s orbiting the planet \nfast enough that it never hits the ground. By the time you made it to \nthe surface of the moon, around 400,000 kilometers away, Earth’s gravitational pull would be less than 0.03 percent of \nwhat you feel on earth. The only gravity you’d be aware of \nwould be the moon’s, which is about one sixth as strong \nas the earth’s. Travel farther still and Earth’s gravitational pull on you\nwill continue to decrease, but never drop to zero. Even safely tethered to the Earth, we’re subject to the faint tug of distant \ncelestial bodies and nearby earthly ones. The Sun exerts a force of about \nhalf a Newton on you. If you’re a few meters away from a \nsmartphone, you'll experience a mutual force of a few piconewtons. That’s about the same as the \ngravitational pull between you and the Andromeda Galaxy, which is 2.5 million light years away but about a trillion times as massive \nas the sun. But when it comes to escaping gravity, there’s a loophole. If all the mass around us is \npulling on us all the time, how would Earth’s gravity change if you tunneled deep below the surface, assuming you could do so without being \ncooked or crushed? If you hollowed out the center \nof a perfectly spherical Earth— which it isn’t, but let’s just say it \nwere— you’d experience an identical pull from \nall sides. And you’d be suspended, weightless, only encountering the tiny pulls \nfrom other celestial bodies. So you could escape the Earth’s gravity \nin such a thought experiment— but only by heading straight into it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In the 17th century, who described the gravitational forces in the Law of Universal Gravitation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Marie Curie"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Albert Einstein"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Isaac Newton"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stephen Hawking"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How much of Earth's gravitational force acts on everyone and everything on board of the International Space Station?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "None"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Approx. 90%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Approx. 100%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Approx. 110%"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What influences the gravitational force two masses act upon each other according to the Law of Universal Gravitation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The color of the two masses"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The materials the two masses are made of"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The distance between the two masses"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How far is the reach of gravitation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Infinite"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To the next galaxy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To the next black hole"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Halfway to the next star"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which weight would an astronaut of 90 kg mass have on the surface of the Moon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "90 kg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Approx. 45 kg"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Approx. 30 kg"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Approx. 15 kg"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 23, "lesson": 8, "title": "Why we say “OK”", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/Js68j4Os", "transcript": {"en": "There’s a two-letter word that we hear everywhere. OK. Okay. OK, are you OK Annie? OK OK OK, OK ladies… OK might be the most recognizable word on\nthe planet. OK! OK. It’s essential to how we communicate with\neach other, and even with our technology. Alexa, turn off the living room light. OK. You probably use it every day – even if\nyou don’t notice it. But, what does OK actually mean? And where did it come from? Hm. OK. Okay then. OK, thank you. OK actually traces back to an 1830s fad of\nintentionally misspelling abbreviations. Young “intellectual” types in Boston delighted\nthose “in the know” with butchered coded messages such as KC, or “knuff ced”, KY,\n“know yuse,” and OW, “oll wright.” Haha. But thanks to a couple of lucky breaks, one\nabbreviation rose above the rest: OK, or “oll korrect.\" In the early 1800s, “all correct” was\na common phrase used to confirm that everything was in order. Its abbreviated cousin started going mainstream\non March 23, 1839, when OK was first published in the Boston Morning Post. Soon other papers picked up on the joke and\nspread it around the country, until OK was something everyone knew about, not just a\nfew Boston insiders. And OK’s newfound popularity even prompted\na flailing US president from Kinderhook, New York, to adopt it as a nickname during his\n1840 reelection campaign. Van Buren’s supporters formed OK Clubs all\nover the country, and their message was pretty clear: Old Kinderhook was “oll korrect.” The campaign was highly publicized and turned\npretty nasty in the press. His opponents ended up turning the abbreviation\naround on him, saying it stood for “Orful Konspiracy” or “Orful Katastrophe” Hah. In the end, even a clever nickname didn’t\nsave Van Buren’s presidency. But it was a win for OK. That 1840 presidential campaign firmly established\nOK in the American vernacular. And while similar abbreviations fell out of\nfashion, OK made the crossover from slang into legitimate, functional use thanks to\none invention: the telegraph. If we lower the bridge, the current flows\nto the sounder. At the other end, the current energizes an\nelectromagnet and this attracts the armature. The armature clicks down against a screw and\ntaps out a message. The telegraph debuted in 1844, just five years\nafter OK. It transmitted short messages in the form\nof electric pulses, with combinations of dots and dashes representing letters of the alphabet. This was OK’s moment to shine. The two letters were easy to tap out and very\nunlikely to be confused with anything else. It was quickly adopted as a standard acknowledgement\nof a transmission received, especially by operators on the expanding US railroad. This telegraphic manual from 1865 even goes\nas far as to say that “no message is ever regarded as transmitted until the office receiving\nit gives O K.” OK had become serious business. But there’s another big reason the two letters\nstuck around, and it’s not just because they’re easy to communicate. It has to do with how OK looks. Or more specifically, how the letter K looks\nand sounds. It’s really uncommon to start a word with\nthe letter K in English — it’s ranked around 22nd in the alphabet. That rarity spurred a “Kraze for K” at\nthe turn of the century in advertising and print, where companies replaced hard Cs with\nKs in order to Katch your eye. The idea was that modifying a word — like\nKlearflax Linen Rugs or this Kook-Rite Stove, for example — would draw more attention\nto it. And that’s still a visual strategy: We see\nK represented in modern corporate logos, like Krispy-Kreme and Kool-Aid. It’s the K that makes it so memorable. By the 1890s, OK’s Bostonian origins were\nalready mostly forgotten, and newspapers began to debate its history — often perpetuating\nmyths in the process that some people still believe. Like the claim that it comes from the Choctaw\nword ‘okeh,’ which means ‘so it is.’ Choctaw gave us the word OK… OK’s beginnings had become obscure but it\ndidn’t really matter anymore — the word was embedded in our language. Today, we use it as the ultimate “neutral\naffirmative.” OK then. Okay then. Learn to truly love yourself. OK. OK. Get yourself up here! OK! I don’t know what to say. Say OK. OK. It’s settled then! Allan Metcalf wrote the definitive history\nof OK, and he explains that the word “affirms without evaluating,” meaning it doesn’t\nconvey any feelings — it just acknowledges and accepts information. If you “got home OK,” it just means you\nwere unharmed. If your “food was OK,” then it was acceptable. And “OK” confirms a change of plans. It’s is sort of a reflex at this point — we\ndon’t even keep track of how much we use it. Which might be why OK was arguably the first\nword spoken when humans landed on the moon. Not bad for a corny joke from the 1830s.

I was having a small operation,\nand my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense\nof detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,\ndrowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time\nor anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense\nof time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from\nanesthesia is very different. I could have been under\nfor five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --\nit's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining\nmysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity\nof many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience\nright here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness\nfor each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through\nmental illness or pain. And if we can experience\njoy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,\nmaybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops\na sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects\nfor a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because\nmy research is telling me that consciousness has less to do\nwith pure intelligence and more to do with our nature\nas living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence\nare very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,\nbut you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences\nof the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through\nand because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard\nthat we know nothing about how the brain and body\ngive rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond\nthe reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion\nof scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab\nat the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists\nfrom all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand\nhow consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've\ncome to think about life. At one time, people thought\nthe property of being alive could not be explained\nby physics and chemistry -- that life had to be\nmore than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties\nof living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,\nreproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is\nstarted to fade away, and people didn't propose\nany more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening\ninside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery\nof what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science\nof consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think\nof consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences\nof the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,\n3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience\nof being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness\nwe all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences\nof the world around us, and with the important idea\nof the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure\nwhat's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.\nThere's no sound either. All you've got to go on\nis streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related\nto things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --\nfiguring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines\nthese sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs\nabout the way the world is to form its best guess\nof what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess\nof what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple\nof examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think\nabout it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be\nvery different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact\nexactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version\nof the image here and join the two patches\nwith a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across\nand join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,\nthere's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,\nand it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain\nis using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits\nof the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims\nthe appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter\nthan it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly\nthe brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again\nand see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit\nis a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.\nI'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory\ninformation coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed\nis your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes\nwhat you consciously hear. All this puts the brain\nbasis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely\non signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions\nflowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively\nperceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience\ncomes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you\none more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive\nvirtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects\nof overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,\nwe've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using\nan algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects\nof overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see\nthis is a very strange thing. When perceptual\npredictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much\nlike the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind\nof uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now\nis also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions\nare being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all\nhallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree\nabout our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you\nthat your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination\ngenerated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions\nmight deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived\nabout what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified\nand so continuous that it's difficult\nnot to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways\nwe experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences\nof perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences\nof intending to do things and of being the cause of things\nthat happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous\nand distinctive person over time, built from a rich set\nof memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists\nand neurologists know very well, that these different ways\nin which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is\nthe basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather\nfragile construction of the brain. Another experience,\nwhich just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate\nthe experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not\npart of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment\nin neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand\nis placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously\nstroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand\nis in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence\nbetween seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand\nand is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain\nto make its best guess that the fake hand\nis in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure\nall kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance\nand startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue\nhas assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences\nof what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled\nhallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies\nas objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense\nof being a body from the inside. And sensory signals\ncoming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain\nabout the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,\nwhat the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,\nwhich we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation\nof the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version\nof the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see\na virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time\nwith their heartbeat. And when it's flashing\nin time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense\nthat it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body\nare deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing\nI want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body\nfrom the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,\nthe world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it\nas an object from the outside. But my experiences\nof the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them\nmuch at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal\nstate of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables\nwithin the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions\nto figure out what's there, we perceive objects\nas the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions\nto control and regulate things, we experience how well\nor how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences\nof being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological\nmechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea\nall the way through, we can start to see\nthat all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same\nmechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic\ndrive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of\nour living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess\nof what's out there. Our experienced world\ncomes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows\nthat this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions\ndepend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self\nare more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world\naround us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds\nof controlled hallucinations that have been shaped\nover millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds\nfull of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three\nimplications of all this. First, just as we can\nmisperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms\nof prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new\nopportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally\nget at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like\ndepression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me\ncannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences\nare shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms\nthat keep us alive. Just making computers smarter\nis not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible\nway of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space\nof possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds\nare unique to each of us, but they're all grounded\nin biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,\nfrom Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of\nand not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

When functioning properly, this ring of tissue plays a crucial\nrole in helping us eat. But when the LES malfunctions, it becomes the main player in heartburn --a searing, sometimes sour-tasting\nchest-spasm that many people will experience\nat some point in their lives. We know that humans have\nbeen battling heartburn for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But recently the incidence has risen, making it a common stomach \ncomplaint worldwide. When the symptoms of heartburn become more\nmore regular and intense —such as twice a week or more-- it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal\nReflux Disease, or GERD. But what causes this problem, and how can it be stopped? Heartburn starts in an area called the gastroesophageal junction, \nwhere the LES resides. This smooth, muscular ring of the LES is moderated by an intricate \ntree of nerve roots that connect to the brain, \nthe heart, and the lungs. After food enters the stomach\nfrom the esophagus, the muscle’s task is to stop it from surging back up again. The LES contracts, squeezing \nthe stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents digestive acids \nfrom seeping out. But if the LES relaxes at the\nwrong moment or gradually weakens, it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid, causing the area to depressurize. That allows burning stomach acid-- and even chunks of food--to spurt into the esophagus, sometimes going \nas far up as the mouth. The cause of all this internal drama has long been put down to diet. Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a\nrelaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. Other acidic foods, \nlike citrus and tomatoes, can worsen irritation of the esophagus when they leach out with stomach acid. Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. But researchers have discovered\nthat food isn’t the only trigger. Smoking poses a risk, because the nicotine\nin cigarettes relaxes the LES. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol may have a similar effect. Pregnant women often experience\nmore heartburn due to the pressure of a growing baby\non their stomachs. and the levels of certain hormones \nin their bodies. Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt the anti-reflux barrier of\nthe gastroesophageal junction that normally protects \nagainst heartburn. Numerous medications, \nincluding those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control, \nand depression can also have unintended \neffects on the LES. An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid \nleakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it \nharder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare\ncondition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to \nminimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that point. Reducing the consumption \nof certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining \na healthy weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can \nhelp our LES’s keep the chemical fountain of \nour stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the burn."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the cardinal complaints of reflux?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "chronic cough"}, {"label": "B", "text": "heartburn and regurgitation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "bloating"}, {"label": "D", "text": "abdominal pain"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the primary mechanism of heartburn?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Too much stomach acid production"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Inability of the esophagus (food pipe) to clear stomach contents"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Temporary relaxations in the lower esophageal sphincter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Prolonged structural dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Suboptimal gastric accommodation in response to ingested meals"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are common reported dietary risk factors for heartburn?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Peppermint"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Caffeine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alcohol"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Citrus foods and tomatoes"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of these things"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The lower esophageal sphincter is comprised of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "skeletal muscle that is under voluntary control"}, {"label": "B", "text": "both the diaphragmatic crura and a ring of smooth muscle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "punctuated high amplitude contractions of both skeletal and smooth muscle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a physical ball-valve that controls the passage of food and liquids"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The most commonly reported form of reflux is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Acid reflux"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Alkaline reflux"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Weakly acid or mixed acid reflux"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Prolonged acid reflux with punctuated moments of alkaline reflux"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But not so long ago, many burial grounds were lively places, with blooming gardens and crowds of people strolling among the headstones. How did our cemeteries \nbecome what they are today? Some have been around for centuries, like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam, where more than five million \npeople are buried. But most of the places we’d recognize \nas cemeteries are much younger. In fact, for much of human history, we didn’t bury our dead at all. Our ancient ancestors had many other ways \nof parting with the dead loved ones. Some were left in caves, others in trees or on mountaintops. Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated. All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead. By contrast, the first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors, excluding them from the usual rites intended to honor the dead. But the first burials revealed some\nadvantages over other practices: they protected bodies from scavengers \nand the elements, while shielding loved ones from the \nsight of decay. These benefits may have shifted \nancient people’s thinking toward graves designed to honor the dead, and burial became more common. Sometimes, these graves contained \npractical or ritual objects, suggesting belief in an afterlife Communal burials first appeared in North \nAfrica and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago, around the same time as the first \npermanent settlements in these areas. These burial grounds created permanent \nplaces to commemorate the dead. The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes with grave mounds known as kurgans. The Etruscans built expansive necropoles, their grid-patterned streets \nlined with tombs. In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed both cremation urns and intact remains. The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,” was first used by ancient Greeks, who built tombs in graveyards at the edges of their cities. In medieval European cities, Christian churchyards provided \nrare, open spaces that accommodated the dead, but also hosted markets, fairs, \nand other events. Farmers even grazed cattle in them, believing graveyard grass made \nfor sweeter milk. As cities grew during the industrial \nrevolution, large suburban cemeteries replaced \nsmaller urban churchyards. Cemeteries like the 110-acre \nPère-Lachaise in Paris or the 72-acre Mt. Auburn \nin Cambridge, Massachusetts were lushly landscaped gardens filled with sculpted stones and ornate tombs. Once a luxury reserved for the rich \nand powerful, individually marked graves became available to the middle \nand working classes. People visited cemeteries for funerals, but also for anniversaries, holidays, or simply an afternoon outdoors. By the late 19th century, as more public \nparks and botanical gardens appeared, cemeteries began to lose visitors. Today, many old cemeteries are \nlonely places. Some are luring visitors back with tours, concerts, and other attractions. But even as we revive old cemeteries, we’re rethinking the future of burial. Cities like London, New York, and \nHong Kong are running out of burial space. Even in places where space isn’t so tight, cemeteries permanently occupy land that can’t be otherwise cultivated \nor developed. Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals. With increasing awareness of the \nenvironmental costs, people are seeking alternatives. Many are turning to cremation and \nrelated practices. Along with these more conventional \npractices, people can now have their remains \nshot into space, used to fertilize a tree, or made into jewelry, fireworks, and even tattoo ink. In the future, options like these may \nreplace burial completely.

Avery", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-rollercoasters-affect-your-body-brian-d-avery", "transcript": {"en": "In the summer of 1895, \ncrowds flooded the Coney Island boardwalk to see the latest marvel \nof roller coaster technology: the Flip Flap Railway. This was America’s first-ever looping coaster – but its thrilling flip came at a price. The ride caused numerous cases of \nsevere whiplash, neck injury and even ejections, all due to its signature loop. Today, coasters can pull off \nfar more exciting tricks, without resorting to the “thrill” \nof a hospital visit. But what exactly are roller coasters \ndoing to your body, and how have they managed to get scarier\nand safer at the same time? At the center of every roller coaster \ndesign is gravity. Unlike cars or transit trains, most coasters are propelled around their tracks almost entirely by gravitational energy. After the coaster crests the initial lift hill, it begins an expertly engineered cycle – building potential energy on ascents\nand expending kinetic energy on descents. This rhythm repeats throughout the ride, acting out the coaster engineer’s\nchoreographed dance of gravitational energy. But there’s a key variable in this cycle\nthat wasn’t always so carefully considered: you. In the days of the Flip-Flap, ride designers were most concerned \nwith coasters getting stuck somewhere along the track. This led early builders to overcompensate, hurling trains down hills and pulling on the brakes \nwhen they reached the station. But as gravity affects the cars, \nit also affects the passengers. And under the intense conditions\nof a coaster, gravity’s effects are multiplied. There’s a common unit used by jet pilots, astronauts, and coaster designers called “g force”. One G force is the familiar tug of gravity\nyou feel when standing on Earth – this is the force of Earth’s \ngravitational pull on our bodies. But as riders accelerate and decelerate, they experience more or less \ngravitational force. Modern ride designers know that the \nbody can handle up to roughly 5 Gs, but the Flip-Flap and its contemporaries \nroutinely reached up to 12 Gs. At those levels of gravitational pressure, blood is sent flying from your brain\nto your feet, leading to light-headedness or blackouts as the brain struggles to stay conscious. And oxygen deprivation in the retinal cells\nimpairs their ability to process light, causing greyed out vision or temporary blindness. If the riders are upside down,\nblood can flood the skull, causing a bout of crimson vision\ncalled a “redout”. Conversely, negative G’s \ncreate weightlessness. Within the body, short-term weightlessness\nis mostly harmless. It can contribute to a rider’s \nmotion sickness by suspending the fluid in \ntheir inner ears which coordinates balance. But the bigger potential danger – and thrill – comes from what ride designers \ncall airtime. This is when riders typically\nexperience seat separation, and, without the proper precautions, ejection. The numerous belts and harnesses \nof modern coasters have largely solved this issue, but the passenger’s ever-changing position\ncan make it difficult to determine what needs to be \nstrapped down. Fortunately, modern ride designers\nare well aware of what your body, and the coaster, can handle. Coaster engineers play these competing \nforces against each other, to relieve periods of intense pressure\nwith periods of no pressure at all. And since a quick transition from \npositive to negative G-force can result in whiplash, headaches, \nand back and neck pain, they avoid the extreme changes\nin speed and direction so common in thrill rides of old. Modern rides are also much sturdier, closely considering the amount\nof gravity they need to withstand. At 5 G’s, your body feels 5 times heavier; so if you weigh 100lbs, you’d exert the weight of 500 lbs\non the coaster. Engineers have to account for \nthe multiplied weight of every passenger when designing \na coaster’s supports. Still, these rides aren’t for everyone. The floods of adrenaline, \nlight-headedness, and motion sickness aren’t going anywhere soon. But today’s redundant restraints, \n3D modeling and simulation software have made roller coasters safer \nand more thrilling than ever. Our precise knowledge about the \nlimits of the human body have helped us build coasters that are \nfaster, taller, and loopier – and all without going off the rails."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Americas first looping roller coaster, the Flip-Flap Railway, was unveiled at the Coney Island Boardwalk in the summer of 1895.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following passenger carrying devices moves by converting potential energy into kinetic energy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Automobile"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Airplane"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Roller Coaster"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Train"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is the gravitational pull experienced by a person standing on Earth’s surface while waiting on line for a roller coaster ride?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Negative 1-G"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Positive 1-G"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Positive 5-Gs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Positive 12-Gs"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following are known symptoms of passengers experiencing roller coasters that have gravitational pressures at 12-Gs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lightheadedness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Blackouts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Temporary blindness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Greyed-out vision"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Positive G-Forces can contribute to the experience of weightlessness while riding roller coasters.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A quick transition from a positive to negative G-force can result in headaches, back and neck pain, and whiplash.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "During a roller coaster ride, if you weigh 175 pounds and experience 5-Gs, how heavy will you feel as a result of Earth’s gravitational pull while on the roller coaster?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "175 pounds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "350 pounds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "525 pounds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "740 pounds"}, {"label": "E", "text": "875 pounds"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

Nearly all of his riches are invested in a collection of 30 exquisite Burmese rubies, and the crowd in the square is clamoring for their confiscation to reimburse his victims. But the scoundrel and his allies at court have made a convincing case that at least some of his wealth was obtained legitimately, and through good service to the crown. The king ponders for a minute and announces his judgment. Because there’s no way to know which portion of the rubies \nwere bought with ill-gotten wealth, the fine will be determined through \na game of wits between the merchant and the king’s most clever advisor – you. You’re both told the rules in advance. The merchant will be allowed to\ndiscreetly divide his rubies among three boxes, which\nwill then be placed in front of you. You will be given three cards, and must write a number \nbetween 1 and 30 on each, before putting a card in\nfront of each of the boxes. The boxes will then all be opened. For each box, you will receive exactly as many rubies as the number written\non the corresponding card, if the box has that many. But if your number is greater than \nthe number of rubies actually there, the scoundrel gets to keep the entire box. The king puts just two constraints on how\nthe scoundrel distributes his rubies. Each box must contain at least two rubies and one of the boxes must contain \nexactly six more rubies than another— but you won’t know which boxes those are. After a few minutes of deliberation, the merchant hides the gems, \nand the boxes are brought in front of you. Which numbers should you choose in order to guarantee the largest possible\nfine for the scoundrel and the greatest compensation \nfor his victims? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You don’t want to overshoot\nby being too greedy. But there is a way you can guarantee to get more than half of the scoundrel’s \nstash. The situation resembles an \nadversarial game like chess – only here you can’t see the \nopponent’s position. To figure out the minimum number of rubies\nyou’re guaranteed to win, you need to look for the worst case\nscenario, as if the merchant already knew your move and could arrange the rubies \nto minimize your winnings. Because you have no way of knowing which\nboxes will have more or fewer rubies, you should pick the same number for each. Suppose you write three 9’s. The scoundrel might have allocated the\nrubies as 8, 14 and 8. In that case, you’d receive 9 from the\nmiddle box and no others. On the other hand, you can be\nsure that at least two boxes have a minimum of 8 rubies. Here’s why. We’ll start by assuming the opposite, that two boxes have 7 or fewer. Those could not be the two that \ndiffer by 6, because every box must have \nat least 2 rubies. In that case, the third box would have at\nmost 13 rubies—that’s 7 plus 6. Add up all three of those boxes, and the most that could equal is 27. Since that’s less than 30, this scenario isn’t possible. You now know, by what’s called\na proof by contradiction, that two of the boxes have \n8 or more rubies. If you ask for 8 from all three boxes you’ll receive at least 16— and that’s the best you can guarantee, as you can see by thinking again\nabout the 8, 14, 8 scenario. You’ve recovered more than half the \nscoundrel’s fortune as restitution for the public. And though he’s managed to hold\non to some of his rubies, his fortune has definitely \nlost some of its shine."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In this puzzle, your strategy is a balance between not asking for too little and not asking for too much.

At first the answer seems obvious— of course time exists; it constantly unfolds all around us, and it’s hard to imagine the universe without it. But our understanding of time started getting complicated thanks to Einstein. His theory of relativity tells us that time passes for everyone, but doesn’t always pass at the same rate for people in different situations, like those travelling close to the speed of light or orbiting a supermassive black hole. Einstein resolved the malleability of time by combining it with space to define space-time, which can bend, but behaves\nin consistent, predictable ways. Einstein’s theory seemed to confirm that time is woven into the very fabric of the universe. But there’s a big question it didn’t fully resolve: why is it we can move through space in any direction, but through time in only one? No matter what we do, the past is always, stubbornly, behind us. This is called the arrow of time. When a drop of food coloring is dropped into a glass of water, we instinctively know that the coloring will drift out from the drop, eventually filling the glass. Imagine watching the opposite happen. Here, we’d recognize time as unfolding backwards. We live in a universe where the food coloring spreads out in the water,  not a universe where it collects together. In physics, this is described by the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which says that systems will gain disorder, or entropy, over time. Systems in our universe move from order to disorder, and it is that property of the universe that defines the direction of time’s arrow. So if time is such a fundamental property, it should be in our most fundamental equations describing the universe, right? We currently have two sets of equations that govern physics. General relativity describes the behavior of very large things, while quantum physics explains the very small. One of the biggest goals in theoretical physics over the last half century has been reconciling the two into one fundamental “theory of everything.\" There have been many attempts —none yet proven— and they treat time in different ways. Oddly enough, one contender called the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, doesn’t include time at all. Like all current theories of everything, that equation is speculative. But as a thought experiment, if it or a similarly time-starved equation turned out to be true, would that mean that time doesn’t exist, at the most fundamental level? Could time just be some sort of illusion generated by the limitations of the way we perceive the universe? We don’t yet know, but maybe that’s the wrong way of thinking about it. Instead of asking if time exists as a fundamental property, maybe it could exist as an emergent one. Emergent properties are things that don’t exist in individual pieces of a system, but do exist for the system as a whole. Each individual water molecule doesn’t have a tide, but the whole ocean does. A movie creates change through time by using a series of still images that appear to have a fluid, continuous change between them. Flipping through the images fast enough, our brains perceive the passage of time from the sequence of still images. No individual frame of the movie changes or contains the passage of time, but it’s a property that comes out of how the pieces are strung together. The movement is real, yet also an illusion. Could the physics of time somehow be a similar illusion? Physicists are still exploring these and other questions, so we’re far from a complete explanation.

{"page": 23, "lesson": 15, "title": "What happens in your body when you swallow gum?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/sDpHPRml", "transcript": {"en": "- [Instructor] You may have heard from your second grade teacher\nthat if you swallow gum, it could stay in your stomach forever or worse, it could grow into\na rubber tree in your stomach. Well, that's true, so don't do it. (peppy instrumental music) Okay, maybe not. Swallowing chewing gum isn't\nreally gonna plant trees in your stomach, but that's no reason to start doing it regularly. Here's what happens to your\nbody when you swallow gum. When you eat standard food,\nthree processes go to work in your body to turn that food into fuel. The first is obvious, it's chewing. The process breaks food down into smaller and smaller pieces, increasing the surface area. Meanwhile, saliva coats those\npieces, delivering enzymes that help break down the food. Finally, once swallowed, the stomach acids turn any\nremaining food pieces into mush. This lets the food pass through the rest of your digestive track smoothly, but gum doesn't play by those rules. As much as you chew it, gum doesn't break into smaller pieces. That's because it's gum, duh! Gum has been around much\nlonger than you think. Ancient Mayans and Aztecs harvested resin from a sapodilla tree. They would dry it into a chaw and chew it to stave off hunger. Even back then, it was also recognized as a breath freshener. However, most gum today\nis made from natural or synthetic polymers,\nmost commonly butyl rubber. It's used in all kinds of products, including adhesives, fiber\noptics, sealants, cling film, paper, fuel, explosives,\nsporting equipment, roofing, bottle stoppers, and tires. But don't worry, the butyl in\nyour gum won't make you sick. That's because it can't be broken down. The wad of chewing gum\nhits your stomach intact. Your saliva enzymes and your stomach acid can't touch the butyl in the gum base, but that doesn't mean it just hangs out. Your body is equipped to handle\ngum the same way it deals with other food that\nit can't fully digest, like corn and sunflower seeds. (peppy instrumental music) The muscles of your\ndigestive tract move it along and eventually flush it out of\nyour system in a day or two, along with everything else. So, no, the gum doesn't stay in your body when you swallow it, but that's no reason to start\ngulping it down by the pack. The more gum your body has to process, the higher likelihood\nthat it will build up. This gum mass can potentially\nclog your digestive tract, causing an intestinal blockage which can trigger stomach\npain or constipation. There's a lovely name for\nthis blockage, a bezoar. An 18-year-old Israeli woman once suffered from a bezoar that blocked her stomach. The problem? Turns out she had been\nswallowing at least five pieces of gum every day. The blockage had grown so large\nthat doctors had to break it into smaller pieces and then fish it out\nof her piece by piece. But chewing gum alone isn't\nnecessarily bad for you. A couple of small studies\nhave shown that the act of chewing gum can\nactually help relax you, because it can help\nreduce levels of cortisol, a common stress hormone, in your saliva. Feel free to unwrap a stick. You won't be alone, 56%\nof Americans chew gum, each about 280 sticks per year. It's a two billion dollar\nindustry in the U.S., but be wary of swallowing\nit once you're done. The occasional piece of gum won't hurt, but with everything else your\nbody already does for you, why put it through the extra work? Also, don't spit it out on the ground. That's just gross. Find a trashcan, like a normal person."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What ingredient in modern gum is non-digestible?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rubber"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chicle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Artificial flavor"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is another food does your body not digest?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pumpkin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Corn husks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Toffee"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

For good luck, he carried one of the holiest relics in Christendom: the veil that had belonged to the Virgin Mary. Unfortunately, it didn’t help. Not only was his army defeated, but as they fled, the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks. To make matters worse, a strong wind made the relic too heavy to carry, so he stashed it in some bushes as he escaped. But even as he fled, he managed to slay some Scythians and rescue a few comrades. At least, this is how Alexios' daughter Anna recounted the story, writing nearly 60 years later. She spent the last decade of her long life creating a 500-page history of her father’s reign called The Alexiad. Written in Greek, the book was modeled after ancient Greek epics and historical writings. But Anna had a different, trickier task than the writers in these traditions: as a princess writing about her own family, she had to balance her loyalty to her kin with her obligation to portray events accurately, navigating issues like Alexios’s embarrassing stab to the buttocks. A lifetime of study and participation in her father’s government prepared Anna for this undertaking. Anna was born in 1083, shortly after her father seized control of the Roman Empire following a decade of brutal civil wars and revolts. The empire was deep in decline when he came to power, and threatened from all sides: by the Seljuk Turks in the East, the Normans in the West, and Scythian raiders to the north. Over the course of Anna’s childhood and adolescence, Alexios fought constant military campaigns to secure the frontiers of his empire, even striking up an uneasy alliance with the Crusaders. Meanwhile in Constantinople, Anna fought her own battle. She was expected to study subjects considered proper for a Byzantine princess, like courtly etiquette and the Bible, but preferred classical myth and philosophy. To access this material, she had to learn to read and speak Ancient Greek, by studying secretly at night. Eventually her parents realized how serious she was, and provided her with tutors. Anna expanded her studies to classical literature, rhetoric, history, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. One scholar even complained that her constant requests for more Aristotle commentaries were wearing out his eyes. At age fifteen, Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios to quell old conflicts between their families and strengthen Alexios’s reign. Fortunately, Anna and Nikephoros ended up sharing many intellectual interests, hosting and debating the leading scholars of the day. Meanwhile, Alexios’s military excursions began to pay off, restoring many of the empire’s former territories. As her father aged, Anna and her husband helped her parents with their imperial duties. During this time, Anna reportedly advocated for just treatment of the people in their disputes with the government. After Alexios’s death, Anna’s brother John ascended to the throne and Anna turned back to philosophy and scholarship. Her husband had written a history arguing that his grandfather would have made a better emperor than Alexios, but Anna disagreed. She began working on the Alexiad, which made the case for her father's merits as emperor. Spanning the late 11th and early 12th centuries of Byzantine history, the Alexiad recounts the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign, and Anna’s own reactions to those events, like bursting into tears at the thought of the deaths of her parents and husband. She may have included \nthese emotional passages in hopes that they would make her writing more palatable to a society that believed women shouldn't write about battles and empires. While her loyalty to her father was evident in her favorable account of his reign, she also included criticism and her opinions of events. In the centuries after her death, Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over, and remains an invaluable eyewitness account of Alexios’s reign today. And through her epic historical narrative, Anna Komnene secured her own place in history."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What did Anna Komnene want to study as a child?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Bible"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Saints' lives"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Norse mythology"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Classical Greek"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Latin"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who did Anna Komnene write a history about?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Uncle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Husband"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Father"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mother"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Brother"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Anna’s history describes her father’s efforts to fight off invasions of all of the following EXCEPT:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Scythians"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Turks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Normans"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Egyptians"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does Anna’s history include a first-hand account of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The First Crusade"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Rennaissance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Fall of Rome"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Norman Conquest of England"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the style of Anna’s history?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A novel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A play"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An ancient Greek history"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A Latin chronicle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A sonnet"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 23, "lesson": 17, "title": "How to make stress your friend - Kelly McGonigal", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/q22s5JoA", "transcript": {"en": "I have a confession to make. But first, I want you to make\na little confession to me. In the past year,\nI want you to just raise your hand if you've experienced\nrelatively little stress. Anyone? How about a moderate amount of stress? Who has experienced a lot of stress? Yeah. Me too. But that is not my confession. My confession is this: I am a health psychologist, and my mission is to help people\nbe happier and healthier. But I fear that something\nI've been teaching for the last 10 years\nis doing more harm than good, and it has to do with stress. For years I've been telling people,\nstress makes you sick. It increases the risk of everything\nfrom the common cold to cardiovascular disease. Basically, I've turned stress\ninto the enemy. But I have changed my mind about stress, and today, I want to change yours. Let me start with the study\nthat made me rethink my whole approach to stress. This study tracked 30,000 adults\nin the United States for eight years, and they started by asking people, \"How much stress have you\nexperienced in the last year?\" They also asked, \"Do you believe that stress\nis harmful for your health?\" And then they used public death records\nto find out who died. (Laughter) Okay. Some bad news first. People who experienced a lot of stress\nin the previous year had a 43 percent increased risk of dying. But that was only true for the people who also believed that stress\nis harmful for your health. (Laughter) People who experienced a lot of stress but did not view stress as harmful were no more likely to die. In fact, they had the lowest risk of dying of anyone in the study, including people\nwho had relatively little stress. Now the researchers estimated\nthat over the eight years they were tracking deaths, 182,000 Americans died prematurely, not from stress, but from the belief\nthat stress is bad for you. (Laughter) That is over 20,000 deaths a year. Now, if that estimate is correct, that would make\nbelieving stress is bad for you the 15th largest cause of death\nin the United States last year, killing more people than skin cancer,\nHIV/AIDS and homicide. (Laughter) You can see why this study freaked me out. Here I've been spending\nso much energy telling people stress is bad for your health. So this study got me wondering: Can changing how you think\nabout stress make you healthier? And here the science says yes. When you change your mind about stress, you can change\nyour body's response to stress. Now to explain how this works, I want you all to pretend\nthat you are participants in a study designed to stress you out. It's called the social stress test. You come into the laboratory, and you're told you have to give a five-minute impromptu speech\non your personal weaknesses to a panel of expert evaluators\nsitting right in front of you, and to make sure you feel the pressure, there are bright lights\nand a camera in your face, kind of like this. (Laughter) And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging,\nnon-verbal feedback, like this. (Exhales) (Laughter) Now that you're sufficiently demoralized, time for part two: a math test. And unbeknownst to you, the experimenter has been trained\nto harass you during it. Now we're going to all do this together. It's going to be fun. For me. Okay. (Laughter) I want you all to count backwards from 996 in increments of seven. You're going to do this out loud, as fast as you can, starting with 996. Go! (Audience counting) Go faster. Faster please. You're going too slow. (Audience counting) Stop. Stop, stop, stop. That guy made a mistake. We are going to have to start\nall over again. (Laughter) You're not very good at this, are you? Okay, so you get the idea. If you were actually in this study, you'd probably be a little stressed out. Your heart might be pounding, you might be breathing faster,\nmaybe breaking out into a sweat. And normally, we interpret\nthese physical changes as anxiety or signs that we aren't coping\nvery well with the pressure. But what if you viewed them instead as signs that your body was energized, was preparing you to meet this challenge? Now that is exactly\nwhat participants were told in a study conducted\nat Harvard University. Before they went\nthrough the social stress test, they were taught to rethink\ntheir stress response as helpful. That pounding heart\nis preparing you for action. If you're breathing faster,\nit's no problem. It's getting more oxygen to your brain. And participants who learned to view\nthe stress response as helpful for their performance, well, they were less stressed out,\nless anxious, more confident, but the most fascinating finding to me was how their physical\nstress response changed. Now, in a typical stress response, your heart rate goes up, and your blood vessels\nconstrict like this. And this is one of the reasons\nthat chronic stress is sometimes associated\nwith cardiovascular disease. It's not really healthy to be\nin this state all the time. But in the study, when participants viewed\ntheir stress response as helpful, their blood vessels\nstayed relaxed like this. Their heart was still pounding, but this is a much healthier\ncardiovascular profile. It actually looks a lot like what happens in moments of joy and courage. Over a lifetime of stressful experiences, this one biological change could be the difference between a stress-induced\nheart attack at age 50 and living well into your 90s. And this is really what the new\nscience of stress reveals, that how you think about stress matters. So my goal as a health\npsychologist has changed. I no longer want\nto get rid of your stress. I want to make you better at stress. And we just did a little intervention. If you raised your hand and said you'd had a lot of stress\nin the last year, we could have saved your life, because hopefully the next time\nyour heart is pounding from stress, you're going to remember this talk and you're going to think to yourself, this is my body helping me\nrise to this challenge. And when you view stress in that way, your body believes you, and your stress response\nbecomes healthier. Now I said I have over a decade\nof demonizing stress to redeem myself from, so we are going to do\none more intervention. I want to tell you about one of the most under-appreciated\naspects of the stress response, and the idea is this: Stress makes you social. To understand this side of stress, we need to talk about a hormone, oxytocin, and I know oxytocin has already gotten\nas much hype as a hormone can get. It even has its own cute nickname,\nthe cuddle hormone, because it's released\nwhen you hug someone. But this is a very small part\nof what oxytocin is involved in. Oxytocin is a neuro-hormone. It fine-tunes\nyour brain's social instincts. It primes you to do things that strengthen close relationships. Oxytocin makes you crave physical contact\nwith your friends and family. It enhances your empathy. It even makes you more willing\nto help and support the people you care about. Some people have even suggested\nwe should snort oxytocin... to become more compassionate and caring. But here's what most people\ndon't understand about oxytocin. It's a stress hormone. Your pituitary gland pumps this stuff out as part of the stress response. It's as much a part\nof your stress response as the adrenaline that makes\nyour heart pound. And when oxytocin is released\nin the stress response, it is motivating you to seek support. Your biological stress response is nudging you to tell\nsomeone how you feel, instead of bottling it up. Your stress response wants\nto make sure you notice when someone else\nin your life is struggling so that you can support each other. When life is difficult, your stress response wants you\nto be surrounded by people who care about you. Okay, so how is knowing this side\nof stress going to make you healthier? Well, oxytocin doesn't only act\non your brain. It also acts on your body, and one of its main roles in your body is to protect your cardiovascular system\nfrom the effects of stress. It's a natural anti-inflammatory. It also helps your blood vessels\nstay relaxed during stress. But my favorite effect on the body\nis actually on the heart. Your heart has receptors for this hormone, and oxytocin helps heart cells regenerate and heal from any stress-induced damage. This stress hormone\nstrengthens your heart. And the cool thing\nis that all of these physical benefits of oxytocin are enhanced\nby social contact and social support. So when you reach out\nto others under stress, either to seek support\nor to help someone else, you release more of this hormone, your stress response becomes healthier, and you actually recover\nfaster from stress. I find this amazing, that your stress response\nhas a built-in mechanism for stress resilience, and that mechanism is human connection. I want to finish by telling you\nabout one more study. And listen up, because this study\ncould also save a life. This study tracked about 1,000 adults\nin the United States, and they ranged in age from 34 to 93, and they started the study by asking, \"How much stress have you\nexperienced in the last year?\" They also asked, \"How much time have you spent\nhelping out friends, neighbors, people in your community?\" And then they used public records\nfor the next five years to find out who died. Okay, so the bad news first: For every major stressful life experience, like financial difficulties\nor family crisis, that increased the risk\nof dying by 30 percent. But -- and I hope you\nare expecting a \"but\" by now -- but that wasn't true for everyone. People who spent time caring for others showed absolutely no stress-related\nincrease in dying. Zero. Caring created resilience. And so we see once again that the harmful effects\nof stress on your health are not inevitable. How you think and how you act can transform your experience of stress. When you choose to view\nyour stress response as helpful, you create the biology of courage. And when you choose to connect\nwith others under stress, you can create resilience. Now I wouldn't necessarily ask\nfor more stressful experiences in my life, but this science has given me\na whole new appreciation for stress. Stress gives us access to our hearts. The compassionate heart\nthat finds joy and meaning in connecting with others, and yes, your pounding physical heart, working so hard to give you\nstrength and energy. And when you choose to view\nstress in this way, you're not just getting better at stress, you're actually making\na pretty profound statement. You're saying that you can trust yourself\nto handle life's challenges. And you're remembering\nthat you don't have to face them alone. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: This is kind\nof amazing, what you're telling us. It seems amazing to me\nthat a belief about stress can make so much difference\nto someone's life expectancy. How would that extend to advice, like, if someone is making\na lifestyle choice between, say, a stressful job\nand a non-stressful job, does it matter which way they go? It's equally wise to go\nfor the stressful job so long as you believe\nthat you can handle it, in some sense? KM: Yeah, and one thing\nwe know for certain is that chasing meaning\nis better for your health than trying to avoid discomfort. And so I would say that's really\nthe best way to make decisions, is go after what it is\nthat creates meaning in your life and then trust yourself to handle\nthe stress that follows. CA: Thank you so much, Kelly.\nIt's pretty cool. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

{"page": 23, "lesson": 19, "title": "Why should you read \"Waiting for Godot\"? - Iseult Gillespie", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-waiting-for-godot-iseult-gillespie", "transcript": {"en": "A shabby man named Estragon, sits near a tree at dusk and struggles to remove his boot. He’s soon joined by his friend Vladimir, who reminds his anxious companion that they must wait here for someone called Godot. So begins a vexing cycle in which the two debate when Godot will come, why they’re waiting, and whether they’re even at the right tree. From here, Waiting for Godot only gets stranger - but it’s considered a play that changed the face of modern drama. Written by Samuel Beckett between 1949 and 1955, it offers a simple but stirring question - what should the characters do? Estragon: Don’t let's do anything. It's safer. Vladimir: Let’s wait and see what he says. Estragon: Who? Vladimir: Godot. Estragon: Good idea. Such cryptic dialogue and circular reasoning are key features of the Theatre of the Absurd, a movement which emerged after the Second World War and found artists struggling to find meaning in devastation. The absurdists deconstructed plot, character and language to question their meaning and share their profound uncertainty on stage. While this may sound grim, the absurd blends its hopelessness with humor. This is reflected in Beckett’s unique approach to genre in Waiting for Godot, which he branded “a tragicomedy in two acts.\" Tragically, the characters are locked in an existential conundrum: they wait in vain for an unknown figure to give them a sense of purpose, but their only sense of purpose comes from the act of waiting, While they wait, they sink into boredom, express religious dread and contemplate suicide. But comically, there is a jagged humor to their predicament, which comes across in their language and movements. Their interactions are filled with bizarre wordplay, repetition and double entendres, as well as physical clowning, singing and dancing, and frantically swapping their hats. It’s often unclear whether the audience is supposed to laugh or cry - or whether Beckett saw any difference between the two. Born in Dublin, Beckett studied English, French and Italian before moving to Paris, where he spent most of his life writing theatre, poetry and prose. While Beckett had a lifelong love of language, he also made space for silence by incorporating gaps, pauses and moments of emptiness into his work. This was a key feature of his trademark uneven tempo and black humor, which became popular throughout the Theatre of the Absurd. He also cultivated a mysterious persona, and refused to confirm or deny any speculations about the meaning of his work. This kept audiences guessing, increasing their fascination with his surreal worlds and enigmatic characters. The lack of any clear meaning makes Godot endlessly open to interpretation. Critics have offered countless readings of the play, resulting in a cycle of ambiguity and speculation that mirrors the plot of the drama itself. It's been read as an allegory of the Cold War, the French Resistance, and Britain’s colonization of Ireland. The dynamic of the two protagonists has also sparked intense debate. They’ve been read as survivors of the apocalypse, an aging couple, two impotent friends, and even as personifications of Freud’s ego and id. Famously, Beckett said the only thing he could be sure of was that Vladimir and Estragon were \"wearing bowler hats.\" Like the critical speculation and maddening plot, their language often goes in circles as the two bicker and banter, lose their train of thought, and pick up right where they left off: Vladimir: We could start all over again perhaps Estragon: That should be easy Vladimir: It’s the start that’s difficult Estragon: You can start from anything Vladimir: Yes, but you have to decide. Beckett reminds us that just like our daily lives, the world onstage doesn’t always make sense. It can explore both reality and illusion, the familiar and the strange.

Kniesly", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/history-through-the-eyes-of-a-chicken-chris-a-kniesly", "transcript": {"en": "The annals of Ancient Egyptian king \nThutmose III described a marvelous foreign bird that “gives birth daily.” Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits whose cries told of the cosmic struggle between darkness and light. Romans brought them on\ntheir military campaigns to foretell the success of future battles. And today, this bird still occupies\nan important, though much less honorable position – on our dinner plates. The modern chicken is descended\nprimarily from the Red Junglefowl, and partially from three other \nclosely related species, all native to India and Southeast Asia. The region’s bamboo plants produce massive amounts of fruit just once every few decades. Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs daily may have evolved to take advantage \nof these rare feasts, increasing their population\nwhen food was abundant. This was something humans could exploit on a consistent basis, and the birds’ weak flight capabilities and limited need for space made them easy to capture and contain. The earliest domesticated chickens, dating at least back to 7,000 years ago, weren’t bred for food, but for something considered\nless savory today. The aggressiveness of breeding males, armed with natural leg spurs, made cockfighting a popular entertainment. By the second millennium BCE, chickens had spread from the \nIndus Valley to China and the Middle East to occupy\nroyal menageries and to be used in religious rituals. But it was in Egypt where the next chapter in\nthe bird’s history began. When a hen naturally incubates eggs, she will stop laying new ones and sit on a “clutch” of 6\nor more eggs for 21 days. By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE, the Egyptians had learned to artificially incubate chicken eggs by placing them in baskets over hot ashes. That freed up hens to continue\nlaying daily, and what had been a royal delicacy or religious offering became a common meal. Around the same time as Egyptians\nwere incubating eggs, Phoenician merchants introduced\nchickens to Europe, where they quickly became\nan essential part of European livestock. However, for a long time, the chicken’s revered status \ncontinued to exist alongside its culinary one. The Ancient Greeks used fighting roosters as inspirational examples \nfor young soldiers. The Romans consulted chickens as oracles. And as late as the 7th Century, the chicken was considered\na symbol for Christianity. Over the next few centuries, chickens accompanied humans\nwherever they went, spreading throughout the world\nthrough trade, conquest, and colonization. After the Opium Wars, Chinese breeds were brought to England and crossed with local chickens. This gave rise to a phenomenon called “Hen Fever” or “The Fancy”, with farmers all over Europe striving to breed new varieties with particular combinations of traits. This trend also caught the attention of a certain Charles Darwin,\nwho wondered if a similar selective breeding process\noccurred in nature. Darwin would observe hundreds of chickens while finalizing his historic work introducing the theory of Evolution. But the chicken’s greatest\ncontribution to science was yet to come. In the early 20th century, a trio of British scientists conducted extensive crossbreeding\nof chickens, building on Gregor Mendel’s studies of genetic inheritance. With their high genetic diversity, many distinct traits, and only 7 months between generations, chickens were the perfect subject. This work resulted in the famous\nPunnett Square, used to show the genotypes\nthat would result from breeding a given pairing. Since then, numerous breeding initiatives\nhave made chickens bigger and meatier, and allowed them to lay \nmore eggs than ever. Meanwhile, chicken production has shifted \nto an industrial, factory-like model, with birds raised in spaces \nwith a footprint no larger than a sheet of paper. And while there’s been a shift\ntowards free-range farming due to animal rights \nand environmental concerns, most of the world’s more than\n22 billion chickens today are factory farmed. From gladiators and gifts to the gods, to traveling companions \nand research subjects, chickens have played many roles\nover the centuries. And though they may not have come \nbefore the proverbial egg, chickens’ fascinating history tells us \na great deal about our own."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What part of the world is the native range of the Junglefowl?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Southeast Asia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Egypt"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Europe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "China"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following reasons explains why scientists believe chickens were domesticated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "For their use as fortune tellers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "For cockfighting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "For their meat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "For their eggs"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why were chickens influential in Charles Darwin’s development of the Theory of Evolution?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chickens make rapid changes between generations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chickens are one of the oldest species"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chinese chickens adapted to their new European environment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "If humans could breed so many different types of chicken, then so could nature"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why are chickens a good species to help us study genetics?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chickens take only 7 months between generations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chickens have a wide variety of traits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chickens have high genetic diversity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why do modern chickens make more meat and eggs than earlier chickens or junglefowl?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Humans have selectively bred them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Humans have given them growth hormones"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Humans have added frog genes to their DNA"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 23, "lesson": 21, "title": "Why should you read \"Don Quixote\"? - Ilan Stavans", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-don-quixote-ilan-stavans", "transcript": {"en": "Mounting his skinny steed, the protagonist of Don Quixote charges an army of giants. In his eyes, it is his duty to vanquish these behemoths in the name of his beloved lady, Dulcinea. However, this act of valor is ill conceived. As his squire Sancho Panza explains to him time and again, these aren’t giants; they are merely windmills. Don Quixote is undeterred, but his piercing lance is soon caught in their sails. Never discouraged, the knight stands proudly, and becomes even more convinced of his mission. This sequence encapsulates much of what is loved about Don Quixote, the epic, illogical, and soulful tale of Alonso Quijano, who becomes the clumsy but valiant Don Quixote of la Mancha, known as the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance. Originally published in two volumes, the narrative follows Don Quixote as he travels through central and northern Spain fighting the forces of evil. Despite Don Quixote’s lofty imagination, his creator, Miguel de Cervantes, could never have imagined his book would become the best-selling novel of all time. Barring 5 years as a soldier, and 5 more enslaved by pirates, Cervantes spent most of his life as a struggling poet and playwright. It wasn’t until his late 50’s that he published his greatest creation: an epic satire of chivalry novels. At this time, medieval books chronicling the adventures of knights and their moral code dominated European culture. While Cervantes was a fan, he was weary of these repetitive tomes, which focused more on listing heroic feats than character development. To challenge them, he wrote Don Quixote, the story of a hidalgo, or idle nobleman, who spends his days and nights reading chivalry novels. Driven mad by these stories, he fashions himself a champion for the downtrodden. Everyone in his village tries to convince him to give up his lunacy, going so far as to burn some of the lurid books in his personal library. But Don Quixote is unstoppable. He dresses up in old shining armor, mounts his skinny horse, and leaves his village in search of glory. Cervantes’ novel unfolds as a collection of episodes detailing the mishaps of the valiant knight. Yet unlike the chivalry books and perhaps all other prior fiction, Cervantes’ story deeply investigates the protagonist’s inner life. Don Quixote matures as the narrative develops, undergoing a noticeable transformation. This literary revelation has led many scholars to call Don Quixote the first modern novel. And this character development doesn’t happen in isolation. Early on, Don Quixote is joined by a villager-turned-squire named Sancho Panza. Sancho and Don Quixote are a study in opposites: with one as the grounded realist to the other’s idealism. Their lively, evolving friendship is often credited as the original hero and sidekick duo, inspiring centuries of fictional partnerships. Don Quixote was a huge success. Numerous editions were published across Europe in the seventeenth century. Even in the Americas, where the Church banned all novels for being sinful distractions, audiences were known to enjoy pirated editions. The book was so well received that readers clamored for more. After a rival author attempted to cash in on a fake follow-up, Cervantes released the official sequel in response. Now published alongside the first volume as a completed text, this second volume picks up where the original left off, only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes. Just as in real-life, Cervantes included his novel’s success in the world of his characters. This unconventional meta-awareness created philosophical complexity, as the knight and his squire ponder the meaning of their story. Unfortunately, Cervantes had sold the book’s publishing rights for very little. He died rich in fame alone. But his treatise on the power of creativity and individualism has inspired art, literature, popular culture, and even political revolution. Don Quixote argues that our imagination greatly informs our actions, making us capable of change, and, indeed, making us human."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why do Don Quixote and Sancho Panza work well together?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They eat at strange times of the day"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are impatient"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They like to dance together"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their characters complement each other"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why does Don Quixote want to fix the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He is a knight who believes in social justice"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He reads many books"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He doesn’t have any friends"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He loves toys"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why is Don Quixote’s love for Dulcinea described as “platonic”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Plato is their matchmaker"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They love Greek philosophy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They want material fortune"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It’s purely spiritual"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why is Cervantes’s book described as “the first modern novel”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It was originally adapted to television"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The characters evolve throughout the story"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cervantes only wrote poetry before"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It refers to technological advances"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does the term “quixotic” mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A reader"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A person without money"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An old man"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A dreamer"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

OK, so this top strip here, there is a 99% chance that on your keyboard it's:  We all have these QWERTY keyboards. There’s probably even one in your pocket, on a screen. But why? Why is this pattern of letters so familiar? “This of course, is the keyboard.” But why, \"of course?\" QWERTY was just one person’s invention from the 1870s. It’s almost 140 years old,  yet, it's still the standard. “All of these machines are alike in many respects.” We all use it, but don’t know why.  That’s the definition of overrated! And it turns out that this little keyboard is the subject of intense debate, some lies you’ve probably been told before, and a few real explanations that might surprise you.  Including an old fashioned cartel. Lots of people have tried to arrange these jumbled letters. There was a half century period of indecision. Debate. In the 1840's, Hughes Printing Telegraph arranged \nthe keys like a piano keyboard. Or, look at the Hansen’s Writing Ball from 1865. People’s fingers pecked at this thing. The letters varied per version, but they showed up in this pattern. This 1868 typewriter looks weird too, \nbut it was the start of something. The inventor, was Christopher Latham Sholes. He looked like typewriter Santa Claus,\nand he kept going. In 1870, he developed a pattern like this. As of 1873, he’d come up with a keyboard that \nlooked a lot like QWERTY. But there were quirks. Notice that period where the R should be. And the A and Z are flipped. The M \nalso sits next to the L. Remington, a company that made machines for shooting and sewing, bought the design. Suddenly, they were in the typewriter business. The design Sholes patented in 1878 was basically QWERTY. Along with the numbers, the only weirdness is that M next to the L, and the C and X are flipped compared to a\ncontemporary keyboard. The company that made Remington Typewriters was soon sending out \nsales packets with the QWERTY we know and love. But that doesn’t quite explain how QWERTY got big. There are urban legends. One’s that QWERTY was designed that way to keep typewriter keys from jamming. But lots of designs could do that, and there’s not a lot of good evidence that \nthat's why QWERTY was designed. Other options were even still around in 1890, like the Merritt Typewriter. You moved this handle to the right spot\nfor your letter and pressed down. The letters weren’t in QWERTY, they were in a big long strip that looked like this. So it was  a KWBHGP keyboard. Many typists believed it worked as well as QWERTY. But the best evidence of all that\nQWERTY wasn’t “the perfect design,” might be this invention from 1889. The keyboard? Not QWERTY, but XPMCHR. The inventor? Christopher Latham Sholes, the guy who invented QWERTY. He created it just before he died. Even the creator of QWERTY wasn’t settled on QWERTY! And that’s where the cartel comes in. Look at this king. He has something to do with QWERTY. See the label on his crown?  \"Trusts.\" In the 1890s, many companies merged into trusts that allowed \nthem to fix prices and control markets. In 1893, that happened with typewriters, when some of the biggest manufacturers came\ntogether to form Union Typewriter Company. Manufacturers cared most about price and technical improvements, like how the typewriter worked. But there was another effect of the trust. The biggest company made Remington Typewriters, and they used Sholes’ QWERTY keyboard design. The trust did the same. Most experts think the trust didn’t work to fix prices. It had trouble beating innovative competitors. But their market power did fix a pattern on the keyboard. And there’s one more reason why that pattern stuck. Look at these old typewriter ads. Or these early typists. Now you might notice that most of these students are women. That is worth noting! But for the story of QWERTY, it’s more important \nto notice that they’re in a class, together. Typing wasn’t like it is today, where you get one of these at the office, or one of these when you’re born. Typists trained. They took classes. If you took a class, you took it for the most common keyboard. That was QWERTY. People still debate whether QWERTY’s the best. Some say the 1930s DVORAK keyboard is better, others say it too is overrated. Whether it’s the best system or not, QWERTY isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. “How you type is more important than what you type.” “This is the mark of a good typist.” There are so many other unprovable theories \nwhen it comes to QWERTY. One of my favorites is that the \nkeyboard was arranged that way so that sales people could peck out TYPEWRITER \nall on the top of the keyboard."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who was the inventor of the QWERTY keyboard?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Samuel W.

{"page": 23, "lesson": 23, "title": "Can you solve the killer robo-ants riddle? - Dan Finkel", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-killer-robo-ants-riddle-dan-finkel", "transcript": {"en": "The good news is that your experimental robo-ants are a success! The bad news is that you accidentally just gave them the ability to shoot deadly lasers …and you can’t turn it off. You have five minutes to stop them before the lasers go online. Until then, all of your robo-ants will walk inside their habitat at a speed of exactly 1 meter per minute. If they bump into each other or hit a dead end, they’ll instantly turn around and walk back the way they came. When five minutes are up, they’ll turn on their lasers, break free, and stream out into the world, carving a path of destruction as they go. Your one chance to stop them is to insert the two emergency vacuum nozzles into the habitat and suck the ants up before they break free. The nozzles can press into any one location in the habitat through a membrane covering its front side, and any ants that walk past will be sucked up and deactivated. You can’t move the nozzles once they’re placed without leaving a hole that the robo-ants would pour out of, so choosing the right spots will be key. The habitat is made out of meter-long tubes. When the robots reach an intersection, they will pick randomly whether to go left, right, or forward. They only go backward if they hit hit another robo-ant or a dead end. Unfortunately, there are hundreds of them inside the habitat, and if even one escapes, it’ll do a lot of damage. With just less than five minutes remaining, where should you place the 2 vacuum nozzles to suck up all the robo-ants? Pause the video now if\nyou want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 With robo-ants ricocheting all over the habitat, it might seem impossible to stop them before they break free. But this situation is simpler than it seems. Here's why. Imagine just two robo-ants crawling toward each other. When they collide, they immediately reverse directions. And what would that sequence of events look like if they crawled past each other instead? It would look exactly the same before and after their collision, but with their positions swapped. This is true every time a pair of robo-ants meet. Because the identities of individual ants don’t matter, you just need to figure out where you should put the nozzles to capture any single ant walking without interruption for less than 5 minutes, starting from any point in the habitat. That’s much easier to conceptualize and solve. Placing the nozzles at intersections where three or four tubes meet seems like your best bet since that’s where the robo-ants might otherwise change directions and miss your nozzles. There are only four intersections… which two should you pick? The top right intersection has to be one of them. If it isn’t, an ant crawling down from this intersection toward the dead end would crawl for four minutes to get back to the intersection, and then go in any of three directions, walking for at least another minute. Once you’ve placed a nozzle in the top right, the only other choice that has a chance to work is the bottom left. To see that this works, imagine an ant anywhere else in the habitat. Worst case scenario, the ant would start right next to the vacuum nozzle, marching away from it. But in all those worst cases, the ant would march for at most 4 meters before being sucked up into the vacuum. No other choice of two intersection points is guaranteed to get all the robo-ants within five minutes. Having vacuumed them all up, you’ve averted a major crisis. Before you mess with robo-ants again, you’ll want to have a robo-anteater ready. And wouldn’t it be cool if it could fly and breathe fire?

(Laughter) Well, because we're not monkeys, we're fish. (Laughter) Now, knowing you're a fish\nand not a monkey is actually really important\nto understanding where we came from. I teach one of the largest\nevolutionary biology classes in the US, and when my students finally understand\nwhy I call them fish all the time, then I know I'm getting my job done. But I always have to start my classes\nby dispelling some hardwired myths, because without really knowing it,\nmany of us were taught evolution wrong. For instance, we're taught\nto say \"the theory of evolution.\" There are actually many theories,\nand just like the process itself, the ones that best fit the data\nare the ones that survive to this day. The one we know best\nis Darwinian natural selection. That's the process by which organisms\nthat best fit an environment survive and get to reproduce, while those that are less fit\nslowly die off. And that's it. Evolution is as simple as that,\nand it's a fact. Evolution is a fact\nas much as the \"theory of gravity.\" You can prove it just as easily. You just need to look at your bellybutton that you share\nwith other placental mammals, or your backbone that you share\nwith other vertebrates, or your DNA that you share\nwith all other life on earth. Those traits didn't pop up in humans. They were passed down\nfrom different ancestors to all their descendants, not just us. But that's not really\nhow we learn biology early on, is it? We learn plants and bacteria\nare primitive things, and fish give rise to amphibians\nfollowed by reptiles and mammals, and then you get you, this perfectly evolved creature\nat the end of the line. But life doesn't evolve in a line, and it doesn't end with us. But we're always shown evolution\nportrayed something like this, a monkey and a chimpanzee, some extinct humans, all on a forward and steady march\nto becoming us. But they don't become us\nany more than we would become them. We're also not the goal of evolution. But why does it matter? Why do we need to understand\nevolution the right way? Well, misunderstanding evolution\nhas led to many problems, but you can't ask that age-old question, \"Where are we from?\" without understanding\nevolution the right way. Misunderstanding it has led\nto many convoluted and corrupted views of how we should treat\nother life on earth, and how we should treat each other in terms of race and gender. So let's go back four billion years. This is the single-celled organism\nwe all came from. At first, it gave rise\nto other single-celled life, but these are still evolving to this day, and some would say\nthe Archaea and Bacteria that make up most of this group is the most successful on the planet. They are certainly going\nto be here well after us. About three billion years ago,\nmulticellularity evolved. This includes your fungi\nand your plants and your animals. The first animals to develop\na backbone were fishes. So technically,\nall vertebrates are fishes, so technically, you and I are fish. So don't say I didn't warn you. One fish lineage came onto land and gave rise to, among other things,\nthe mammals and reptiles. Some reptiles become birds,\nsome mammals become primates, some primates become monkeys with tails, and others become the great apes,\nincluding a variety of human species. So you see, we didn't evolve from monkeys, but we do share\na common ancestor with them. All the while, life\naround us kept evolving: more bacteria, more fungi,\nlots of fish, fish, fish. If you couldn't tell --\nyes, they're my favorite group. (Laughter) As life evolves, it also goes extinct. Most species just last\nfor a few million years. So you see, most life on earth\nthat we see around us today are about the same age as our species. So it's hubris,\nit's self-centered to think, \"Oh, plants and bacteria are primitive, and we've been here\nfor an evolutionary minute, so we're somehow special.\" Think of life as being this book,\nan unfinished book for sure. We're just seeing the last\nfew pages of each chapter. If you look out\non the eight million species that we share this planet with, think of them all being\nfour billion years of evolution. They're all the product of that. Think of us all as young leaves\non this ancient and gigantic tree of life, all of us connected by invisible branches\nnot just to each other, but to our extinct relatives\nand our evolutionary ancestors. As a biologist, I'm still\ntrying to learn, with others, how everyone's related to each other,\nwho is related to whom. Perhaps it's better still to think of us\nas a little fish out of water. Yes, one that learned to walk and talk, but one that still has\na lot of learning to do about who we are and where we came from. Thank you.
