It's a bit funny, because I did write\nthat humans will become digital, but I didn't think it will happen so fast and that it will happen to me. But here I am, as a digital avatar, and here you are, so let's start. And let's start with a question. How many fascists are there\nin the audience today? (Laughter) Well, it's a bit difficult to say, because we've forgotten what fascism is. People now use the term \"fascist\" as a kind of general-purpose abuse. Or they confuse fascism with nationalism. So let's take a few minutes\nto clarify what fascism actually is, and how it is different from nationalism. The milder forms of nationalism\nhave been among the most benevolent of human creations. Nations are communities\nof millions of strangers who don't really know each other. For example, I don't know\nthe eight million people who share my Israeli citizenship. But thanks to nationalism, we can all care about one another\nand cooperate effectively. This is very good. Some people, like John Lennon,\nimagine that without nationalism, the world will be a peaceful paradise. But far more likely, without nationalism,\nwe would have been living in tribal chaos. If you look today at the most prosperous\nand peaceful countries in the world, countries like Sweden\nand Switzerland and Japan, you will see that they have\na very strong sense of nationalism. In contrast, countries that lack\na strong sense of nationalism, like Congo and Somalia and Afghanistan, tend to be violent and poor. So what is fascism, and how\nis it different from nationalism? Well, nationalism tells me\nthat my nation is unique, and that I have special obligations\ntowards my nation. Fascism, in contrast, tells me\nthat my nation is supreme, and that I have exclusive\nobligations towards it. I don't need to care about anybody\nor anything other than my nation. Usually, of course,\npeople have many identities and loyalties to different groups. For example, I can be a good patriot,\nloyal to my country, and at the same time,\nbe loyal to my family, my neighborhood, my profession, humankind as a whole, truth and beauty. Of course, when I have different\nidentities and loyalties, it sometimes creates conflicts\nand complications. But, well, who ever told you\nthat life was easy? Life is complicated. Deal with it. Fascism is what happens when people try\nto ignore the complications and to make life too easy for themselves. Fascism denies all identities\nexcept the national identity and insists that I have obligations\nonly towards my nation. If my nation demands\nthat I sacrifice my family, then I will sacrifice my family. If the nation demands\nthat I kill millions of people, then I will kill millions of people. And if my nation demands\nthat I betray truth and beauty, then I should betray truth and beauty. For example, how does\na fascist evaluate art? How does a fascist decide whether a movie\nis a good movie or a bad movie? Well, it's very, very, very simple. There is really just one yardstick: if the movie serves\nthe interests of the nation, it's a good movie; if the movie doesn't serve\nthe interests of the nation, it's a bad movie. That's it. Similarly, how does a fascist decide\nwhat to teach kids in school? Again, it's very simple. There is just one yardstick: you teach the kids whatever serves\nthe interests of the nation. The truth doesn't matter at all. Now, the horrors of the Second World War\nand of the Holocaust remind us of the terrible consequences\nof this way of thinking. But usually, when we talk\nabout the ills of fascism, we do so in an ineffective way, because we tend to depict fascism\nas a hideous monster, without really explaining\nwhat was so seductive about it. It's a bit like these Hollywood movies\nthat depict the bad guys -- Voldemort or Sauron\nor Darth Vader -- as ugly and mean and cruel. They're cruel even\nto their own supporters. When I see these movies,\nI never understand -- why would anybody be tempted to follow\na disgusting creep like Voldemort? The problem with evil\nis that in real life, evil doesn't necessarily look ugly. It can look very beautiful. This is something that\nChristianity knew very well, which is why in Christian art,\nas [opposed to] Hollywood, Satan is usually depicted\nas a gorgeous hunk. This is why it's so difficult\nto resist the temptations of Satan, and why it is also difficult\nto resist the temptations of fascism. Fascism makes people see themselves as belonging to the most beautiful\nand most important thing in the world -- the nation. And then people think, \"Well, they taught us\nthat fascism is ugly. But when I look in the mirror,\nI see something very beautiful, so I can't be a fascist, right?\" Wrong. That's the problem with fascism. When you look in the fascist mirror, you see yourself as far more beautiful\nthan you really are. In the 1930s, when Germans\nlooked in the fascist mirror, they saw Germany as the most\nbeautiful thing in the world. If today, Russians look\nin the fascist mirror, they will see Russia as the most\nbeautiful thing in the world. And if Israelis look\nin the fascist mirror, they will see Israel as the most\nbeautiful thing in the world. This does not mean that we are now\nfacing a rerun of the 1930s. Fascism and dictatorships might come back, but they will come back in a new form, a form which is much more relevant to the new technological realities\nof the 21st century. In ancient times, land was the most important\nasset in the world. Politics, therefore,\nwas the struggle to control land. And dictatorship meant that all the land\nwas owned by a single ruler or by a small oligarch. And in the modern age,\nmachines became more important than land. Politics became the struggle\nto control the machines. And dictatorship meant that too many of the machines\nbecame concentrated in the hands of the government\nor of a small elite. Now data is replacing\nboth land and machines as the most important asset. Politics becomes the struggle\nto control the flows of data. And dictatorship now means that too much data is being concentrated\nin the hands of the government or of a small elite. The greatest danger\nthat now faces liberal democracy is that the revolution\nin information technology will make dictatorships\nmore efficient than democracies. In the 20th century, democracy and capitalism\ndefeated fascism and communism because democracy was better\nat processing data and making decisions. Given 20th-century technology, it was simply inefficient to try\nand concentrate too much data and too much power in one place. But it is not a law of nature that centralized data processing\nis always less efficient than distributed data processing. With the rise of artificial intelligence\nand machine learning, it might become feasible to process\nenormous amounts of information very efficiently in one place, to take all the decisions in one place, and then centralized data processing\nwill be more efficient than distributed data processing. And then the main handicap\nof authoritarian regimes in the 20th century -- their attempt to concentrate\nall the information in one place -- it will become their greatest advantage. Another technological danger\nthat threatens the future of democracy is the merger of information technology\nwith biotechnology, which might result\nin the creation of algorithms that know me better than I know myself. And once you have such algorithms, an external system, like the government, cannot just predict my decisions, it can also manipulate\nmy feelings, my emotions. A dictator may not be able\nto provide me with good health care, but he will be able to make me love him and to make me hate the opposition. Democracy will find it difficult\nto survive such a development because, in the end, democracy is not based\non human rationality; it's based on human feelings. During elections and referendums, you're not being asked,\n\"What do you think?\" You're actually being asked,\n\"How do you feel?\" And if somebody can manipulate\nyour emotions effectively, democracy will become\nan emotional puppet show. So what can we do to prevent\nthe return of fascism and the rise of new dictatorships? The number one question that we face\nis: Who controls the data? If you are an engineer, then find ways to prevent too much data from being concentrated in too few hands. And find ways to make sure the distributed data processing\nis at least as efficient as centralized data processing. This will be the best\nsafeguard for democracy. As for the rest of us\nwho are not engineers, the number one question facing us is how not to allow\nourselves to be manipulated by those who control the data. The enemies of liberal democracy,\nthey have a method. They hack our feelings. Not our emails, not our bank accounts -- they hack our feelings of fear\nand hate and vanity, and then use these feelings to polarize and destroy\ndemocracy from within. This is actually a method that Silicon Valley pioneered\nin order to sell us products. But now, the enemies of democracy\nare using this very method to sell us fear and hate and vanity. They cannot create\nthese feelings out of nothing. So they get to know our own\npreexisting weaknesses. And then use them against us. And it is therefore\nthe responsibility of all of us to get to know our weaknesses and make sure that they\ndo not become a weapon in the hands of the enemies of democracy. Getting to know our own weaknesses will also help us to avoid the trap\nof the fascist mirror. As we explained earlier,\nfascism exploits our vanity. It makes us see ourselves\nas far more beautiful than we really are. This is the seduction. But if you really know yourself, you will not fall\nfor this kind of flattery. If somebody puts a mirror\nin front of your eyes that hides all your ugly bits\nand makes you see yourself as far more beautiful\nand far more important than you really are, just break that mirror. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Yuval, thank you. Goodness me. It's so nice to see you again. So, if I understand you right, you're alerting us\nto two big dangers here. One is the possible resurgence\nof a seductive form of fascism, but close to that, dictatorships\nthat may not exactly be fascistic, but control all the data. I wonder if there's a third concern that some people here\nhave already expressed, which is where, not governments,\nbut big corporations control all our data. What do you call that, and how worried should we be about that? Yuval Noah Harari: Well, in the end,\nthere isn't such a big difference between the corporations\nand the governments, because, as I said, the questions is:\nWho controls the data? This is the real government. If you call it a corporation\nor a government -- if it's a corporation\nand it really controls the data, this is our real government. So the difference\nis more apparent than real. CA: But somehow,\nat least with corporations, you can imagine market mechanisms\nwhere they can be taken down. I mean, if consumers just decide that the company is no longer\noperating in their interest, it does open the door to another market. It seems easier to imagine that than, say, citizens rising up\nand taking down a government that is in control of everything. YNH: Well, we are not there yet, but again, if a corporation really\nknows you better than you know yourself -- at least that it can manipulate\nyour own deepest emotions and desires, and you won't even realize -- you will think this is\nyour authentic self. So in theory, yes, in theory,\nyou can rise against a corporation, just as, in theory, you can rise\nagainst a dictatorship. But in practice,\nit is extremely difficult. CA: So in \"Homo Deus,\" you argue\nthat this would be the century when humans kind of became gods, either through development\nof artificial intelligence or through genetic engineering. Has this prospect of political\nsystem shift, collapse impacted your view on that possibility? YNH: Well, I think it makes it\neven more likely, and more likely\nthat it will happen faster, because in times of crisis,\npeople are willing to take risks that they wouldn't otherwise take. And people are willing to try all kinds of high-risk,\nhigh-gain technologies. So these kinds of crises\nmight serve the same function as the two world wars in the 20th century. The two world wars greatly accelerated the development of new\nand dangerous technologies. And the same thing might happen\nin the 21st century. I mean, you need to be\na little crazy to run too fast, let's say, with genetic engineering. But now you have more\nand more crazy people in charge of different\ncountries in the world, so the chances are getting\nhigher, not lower. CA: So, putting it all together, Yuval,\nyou've got this unique vision. Roll the clock forward 30 years. What's your guess --\ndoes humanity just somehow scrape through, look back and say, \"Wow,\nthat was a close thing. We did it!\" Or not? YNH: So far, we've managed\nto overcome all the previous crises. And especially if you look\nat liberal democracy and you think things are bad now, just remember how much worse\nthings looked in 1938 or in 1968. So this is really nothing,\nthis is just a small crisis. But you can never know, because, as a historian, I know that you should never\nunderestimate human stupidity. (Laughter) (Applause) It is one of the most powerful forces\nthat shape history. CA: Yuval, it's been an absolute delight\nto have you with us. Thank you for making the virtual trip. Have a great evening there in Tel Aviv. Yuval Harari! YNH: Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

All of this plastic originated \nfrom one small object— that isn’t even made of plastic. For centuries, billiard balls were \nmade of ivory from elephant tusks. But when excessive hunting caused\nelephant populations to decline in the 19th century, billiard balls makers began to look \nfor alternatives, offering huge rewards. So in 1863 an American named \nJohn Wesley Hyatt took up the challenge. Over the next five years, he invented \na new material called celluloid, made from cellulose, a compound found\nin wood and straw. Hyatt soon discovered celluloid couldn’t\nsolve the billiard ball problem–– the material wasn’t heavy enough \nand didn’t bounce quite right. But it could be tinted and patterned to mimic more expensive\nmaterials like coral, tortoiseshell, amber, and mother-of-pearl. He had created what became\nknown as the first plastic. The word ‘plastic’ can describe \nany material made of polymers, which are just the large molecules\nconsisting of the same repeating subunit. This includes all human-made plastics, as well as many of the materials\nfound in living things. But in general, when people refer \nto plastics, they’re referring to synthetic materials. The unifying feature of these \nis that they start out soft and malleable and can be molded into a particular shape. Despite taking the prize \nas the first official plastic, celluloid was highly flammable,\nwhich made production risky. So inventors began to hunt\nfor alternatives. In 1907 a chemist combined phenol— a waste product of coal tar— and formaldehyde, creating \na hardy new polymer called bakelite. Bakelite was much less flammable \nthan celluloid and the raw materials used to make it were\nmore readily available. Bakelite was only the beginning. In the 1920s, researchers first\ncommercially developed polystyrene, a spongy plastic used in insulation. Soon after came polyvinyl chloride,\nor vinyl, which was flexible yet hardy. Acrylics created transparent, shatter-proof panels \nthat mimicked glass. And in the 1930s nylon took centre stage— a polymer designed to mimic silk, \nbut with many times its strength. Starting in 1933, polyethylene became\none of the most versatile plastics, still used today to make everything \nfrom grocery bags, to shampoo bottles, to bulletproof vests. New manufacturing technologies \naccompanied this explosion of materials. The invention of a technique \ncalled injection-moulding made it possible to insert melted plastics\ninto molds of any shape, where they would rapidly harden. This created possibilities for products\nin new varieties and shapes— and a way to inexpensively and rapidly \nproduce plastics at scale. Scientists hoped this economical \nnew material would make items that once had been\nunaffordable accessible to more people. Instead, plastics were pushed into service\nin World War Two. During the war, plastic production \nin the United States quadrupled. Soldiers wore new plastic helmet liners \nand water-resistant vinyl raincoats. Pilots sat in cockpits made of plexiglass,\na shatterproof plastic, and relied on parachutes \nmade of resilient nylon. Afterwards, plastic manufacturing \ncompanies that had sprung up during wartime turned\ntheir attention to consumer products. Plastics began to replace other materials\nlike wood, glass, and fabric in furniture, clothing, shoes,\ntelevisions, and radios. Versatile plastics opened up possibilities\nfor packaging— mainly designed to keep food \nand other products fresh for longer. Suddenly, there were plastic garbage bags,\nstretchy plastic wrap, squeezable plastic bottles, \ntakeaway cartons, and plastic containers for fruit,\nvegetables, and meat. Within just a few decades, \nthis multifaceted material ushered in what became known as\nthe “plastics century.” While the plastics century brought \nconvenience and cost-effectiveness, it also created staggering \nenvironmental problems. Many plastics are made of nonrenewable\nresources. And plastic packaging was designed\nto be single-use, but some plastics take centuries \nto decompose, creating a huge build up of waste. This century we’ll have to concentrate our\ninnovations on addressing those problems— by reducing plastic use,\ndeveloping biodegradable plastics, and finding new ways \nto recycle existing plastic."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which kind of plastic is still being used today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Polystyrene"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Polyvinyl chloride"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Polyethylene"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Acrylics"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why is plastic used for consumer products?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is shatterproof and resilient"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nonrenewable and biodegradable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Highly flammable and dangerous"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inexpensive and easily accessible"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why did billiard ball makers begin to look for alternatives to ivory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ivory became too expensive"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A new material had been created"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A decline in elephant populations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ivory wasn’t heavy enough"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the unifying feature of different kinds of plastics?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Malleable and can be molded"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Highly flammable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Flexible yet hardy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Heavy and patterned"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When was the first plastic created?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1907"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1833"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1942"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1868"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 9, "lesson": 3, "title": "How to fix a broken heart - Guy Winch", "category": "Emotional Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-fix-a-broken-heart-guy-winch", "transcript": {"en": "At some point in our lives, almost every one of us\nwill have our heart broken. My patient Kathy planned her wedding\nwhen she was in middle school. She would meet her future husband by age 27, get engaged a year later and get married a year after that. But when Kathy turned 27,\nshe didn't find a husband. She found a lump in her breast. She went through many months\nof harsh chemotherapy and painful surgeries, and then just as she was ready\nto jump back into the dating world, she found a lump in her other breast and had to do it all over again. Kathy recovered, though, and she was eager to resume\nher search for a husband as soon as her eyebrows grew back in. When you're going\non first dates in New York City, you need to be able to express\na wide range of emotions. (Laughter) Soon afterwards,\nshe met Rich and fell in love. The relationship was everything\nshe hoped it would be. Six months later, after a lovely weekend in New England, Rich made reservations\nat their favorite romantic restaurant. Kathy knew he was going to propose, and she could barely\ncontain her excitement. But Rich did not propose\nto Kathy that night. He broke up with her. As deeply as he cared\nfor Kathy -- and he did -- he simply wasn't in love. Kathy was shattered. Her heart was truly broken,\nand she now faced yet another recovery. But five months after the breakup, Kathy still couldn't stop\nthinking about Rich. Her heart was still very much broken. The question is: Why? Why was this incredibly strong\nand determined woman unable to marshal the same\nemotional resources that got her through four years\nof cancer treatments? Why do so many of us flounder when we're trying\nto recover from heartbreak? Why do the same coping mechanisms that get us through all kinds\nof life challenges fail us so miserably\nwhen our heart gets broken? In over 20 years of private practice, I have seen people\nof every age and background face every manner of heartbreak, and what I've learned is this: when your heart is broken, the same instincts you ordinarily rely on will time and again lead you\ndown the wrong path. You simply cannot trust\nwhat your mind is telling you. For example, we know from studies\nof heartbroken people that having a clear understanding\nof why the relationship ended is really important\nfor our ability to move on. Yet time and again, when we are offered a simple\nand honest explanation like the one Rich offered Kathy, we reject it. Heartbreak creates\nsuch dramatic emotional pain, our mind tells us the cause\nmust be equally dramatic. And that gut instinct is so powerful, it can make even the most reasonable\nand measured of us come up with mysteries\nand conspiracy theories where none exist. Kathy became convinced\nsomething must have happened during her romantic getaway with Rich that soured him on the relationship, and she became obsessed\nwith figuring out what that was. And so she spent countless hours going through every minute\nof that weekend in her mind, searching her memory for clues\nthat were not there. Kathy's mind tricked her\ninto initiating this wild goose chase. But what compelled her to commit to it\nfor so many months? Heartbreak is far more insidious\nthan we realize. There is a reason we keep going\ndown one rabbit hole after another, even when we know it's going\nto make us feel worse. Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms\nin our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing\nfrom substances like cocaine or opioids. Kathy was going through withdrawal. And since she could not have\nthe heroin of actually being with Rich, her unconscious mind chose\nthe methadone of her memories with him. Her instincts told her\nshe was trying to solve a mystery, but what she was actually doing was getting her fix. This is what makes heartbreak\nso difficult to heal. Addicts know they're addicted. They know when they're shooting up. But heartbroken people do not. But you do now. And if your heart is broken,\nyou cannot ignore that. You have to recognize that,\nas compelling as the urge is, with every trip down memory lane,\nevery text you send, every second you spend\nstalking your ex on social media, you are just feeding your addiction, deepening your emotional pain and complicating your recovery. Getting over heartbreak is not a journey. It's a fight, and your reason\nis your strongest weapon. There is no breakup explanation\nthat's going to feel satisfying. No rationale can take away\nthe pain you feel. So don't search for one,\ndon't wait for one, just accept the one you were offered\nor make up one yourself and then put the question to rest, because you need that closure\nto resist the addiction. And you need something else as well: you have to be willing to let go, to accept that it's over. Otherwise, your mind\nwill feed on your hope and set you back. Hope can be incredibly destructive\nwhen your heart is broken. Heartbreak is a master manipulator. The ease with which it gets our mind\nto do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable. One of the most common tendencies\nwe have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it. We spend hours remembering their smile, how great they made us feel, that time we hiked up the mountain\nand made love under the stars. All that does is make our loss\nfeel more painful. We know that. Yet we still allow our mind to cycle\nthrough one greatest hit after another, like we were being held hostage by our own\npassive-aggressive Spotify playlist. (Laughter) Heartbreak will make those thoughts\npop into your mind. And so to avoid idealizing,\nyou have to balance them out by remembering their frown,\nnot just their smile, how bad they made you feel, the fact that after the lovemaking,\nyou got lost coming down the mountain, argued like crazy\nand didn't speak for two days. What I tell my patients\nis to compile an exhaustive list of all the ways\nthe person was wrong for you, all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves, and then keep it on your phone. (Laughter) And once you have your list, you have to use it. When I hear even a hint of idealizing or the faintest whiff\nof nostalgia in a session, I go, \"Phone, please.\" (Laughter) Your mind will try to tell you\nthey were perfect. But they were not,\nand neither was the relationship. And if you want to get over them,\nyou have to remind yourself of that, frequently. None of us is immune to heartbreak. My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old\nsenior executive in a software company. Five years after his wife died, he finally felt ready\nto start dating again. He soon met Sharon, and a whirlwind romance ensued. They introduced each other\nto their adult children after one month, and they moved in together after two. When middle-aged people date,\nthey don't mess around. It's like \"Love, Actually\"\nmeets \"The Fast and the Furious.\" (Laughter) Miguel was happier\nthan he had been in years. But the night before\ntheir first anniversary, Sharon left him. She had decided to move to the West Coast\nto be closer to her children, and she didn't want\na long-distance relationship. Miguel was totally blindsided\nand utterly devastated. He barely functioned at work\nfor many, many months, and he almost lost his job as a result. Another consequence of heartbreak\nis that feeling alone and in pain can significantly impair\nour intellectual functioning, especially when performing complex tasks\ninvolving logic and reasoning. It temporarily lowers our IQ. But it wasn't just the intensity\nof Miguel's grief that confused his employers; it was the duration. Miguel was confused by this as well and really quite embarrassed by it. \"What's wrong with me?\"\nhe asked me in our session. \"What adult spends almost a year\ngetting over a one-year relationship?\" Actually, many do. Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks\nof traditional loss and grief: insomnia, intrusive thoughts, immune system dysfunction. Forty percent of people experience\nclinically measurable depression. Heartbreak is a complex\npsychological injury. It impacts us in a multitude of ways. For example, Sharon was both very social and very active. She had dinners at the house every week. She and Miguel went on camping trips\nwith other couples. Although Miguel was not religious, he accompanied Sharon\nto church every Sunday, where he was welcomed\ninto the congregation. Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend; he lost his entire social life, the supportive community\nof Sharon's church. He lost his identity as a couple. Now, Miguel recognized the breakup\nhad left this huge void in his life, but what he failed to recognize is that it left far more than just one. And that is crucial, not just because it explains\nwhy heartbreak could be so devastating, but because it tells us how to heal. To fix your broken heart, you have to identify these voids\nin your life and fill them, and I mean all of them. The voids in your identity: you have to reestablish who you are\nand what your life is about. The voids in your social life, the missing activities,\neven the empty spaces on the wall where pictures used to hang. But none of that will do any good unless you prevent the mistakes\nthat can set you back, the unnecessary searches for explanations, idealizing your ex instead of focusing\non how they were wrong for you, indulging thoughts and behaviors\nthat still give them a starring role in this next chapter of your life when they shouldn't be an extra. Getting over heartbreak is hard, but if you refuse to be misled\nby your mind and you take steps to heal, you can significantly minimize\nyour suffering. And it won't just be you\nwho benefit from that. You'll be more present with your friends, more engaged with your family, not to mention the billions of dollars\nof compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided. So if you know someone who is heartbroken, have compassion, because social support has been found\nto be important for their recovery. And have patience, because it's going to take them longer\nto move on than you think it should. And if you're hurting, know this: it's difficult, it is a battle\nwithin your own mind, and you have to be diligent to win. But you do have weapons. You can fight. And you will heal. Thank you.

{"page": 9, "lesson": 4, "title": "Can you solve the sorting hat riddle? - Dan Katz and Alex Rosenthal", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-sorting-hat-riddle-dan-katz-and-alex-rosenthal", "transcript": {"en": "An albatross delivered your invitation,\nyou’ve acquired your wand, ridden the enchanted zeppelin, \nmade some fast friends, and are finally ready for the adventure\nyou’ve dreamed of your entire life: your first day at Magnificent Marigold’s\nMagical Macademy. But before you can learn your first spell you must get through the most\nnerve-wracking moment of the year: the sorting ceremony. When you put on the sorting hat, \nyou hear a voice. “Ah, you’re an interesting one. Every year I choose one student \nfor a special challenge, and I choose you. The Magical Macademy had 8 founders, and they established our four houses \ntwo by two by two by two. I alone know which witches founded which. But there was once \na mysterious fifth house, lost to time but full of secrets\nand powerful artifacts. MMMMMM? If you can tell me who founded each house,\nI’ll sort you into whichever you want. However, if you can also tell me \nthe name of the secret 5th house, I’ll let you sort into it, and you’ll inherit \neverything you discover. “The two founders of each house \nwore different colored hats with non-matching symbols. No founder started more than one house. Of Funflame and Imaginez, \none was a founder of Gianteye and the other of Longmous. And of Miraculo and Rimbleby, one established Longmous\nand the other Meramaid. Finally, Septimus didn’t found Vidopnir.” So… who founded what,\nand what’s the name of the secret house? Pause the video now to\nfigure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The hardest part of solving this logic\npuzzle is knowing where to start. No rule by itself is enough to assign \na founder to his or her house, so the next best thing would be to combine a pair of rules\nto learn something. 4 and 5 are good candidates \nto try that with, because they contain a lot of constraints\nand both mention Longmous. Miraculo and Rimbleby’s hats \nboth have moons, which means that no matter \nwho ends up in Longmous, moons will be accounted for. That means Imaginez, who also has moons,\ncan’t have founded Longmous, so she’s in Gianteye and Funflame\nfounded Longmous. Miraculo’s hat is red, \nso he can’t be there, so he must be in Meramaid \nand Rimbleby in Longmous. Halfway there! Now we can place Septimus–– rule 6 keeps him out of Vidopnir, \nand his yellow hat out of Gianteye, so he must be in Meramaid. Of the founders left, \nDeepmire and Hypnotum both have stars. So each must go into a different house, taking up the remaining space in Gianteye\nand leaving one spot open in Vidopnir, which Tremenda must fill. Tremenda’s blue hat keeps \nDeepmire out of Vidopnir, so we can easily place \nher and, finally, Hypnotum. Now that those founders are sorted, we can start to search \nfor the secret house. If you don’t have it yet, \nhere are a few hints: Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out yourself! One good strategy for a puzzle like this is to look for patterns \nor unusual pieces of information. First of all, there’s the school’s\nobsession with the letter M, right down to its motto, which translates\nfrom Latin to “M is a magic letter.” Curiously, every founder \nhas exactly one M in their name, and each M is in a different position. That means that the M’s can\nput them in order, 1 through 8. We know we needed to solve the logic \npuzzle before finding the secret house, so there must be something critical about the connection between the founders\nand their houses. Here’s where a pattern emerges: \nevery founder and house have exactly the same number of letters. This allows the founders to line up \nwith their houses quite nicely. The first letters don’t spell anything, but let’s look at the M’s in the names\nagain and the letters they line up with: M, I, N, O, T, A, U, R. You shout out “MINOTAUR” to a stunned\ndining hall, and a secret passage grinds open. The wonders of house Minotaur \nare yours if you want them. But being the first and only resident \nof the secret house would come at a high price: loneliness. So which will it be: riches or friendship?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are some possible strategies to consider in order to solve this problem?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Organize the data by writing it down."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Look for the patterns"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Look for unusual pieces of information"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Combine rules of the puzzle"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "True or False: The founding witches who started each of the houses also wore matching hats?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which 2 witches provide the best clues to solving this problem?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Funflame and Imaginez"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Miraculo and Rimbleby"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Septimus and Deepmire"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hypnotom and Tremenda"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "True or False: Vidopnir was not founded by Septimus", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "An artifact is…", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An object you find in your desk at school"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Something old that you find in the back of your fridge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An item of cultural or historical interest made by a human being"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Something you would find in a museum or mythical house"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both C and D"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

Bressman", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-fish-that-walk-on-land-noah-r-bressman", "transcript": {"en": "This pond is the only home \nthis fish has ever known. But lately, it’s gotten crowded \nand food is scarce. Luckily, it has an option many don’t: as a walking catfish, it can dance \nits way out of the water and onto bigger and better things. However, it faces many challenges \non its terrestrial journey: it’s now in danger of suffocating, \ndrying up, suffering physical damage \nfrom rough terrain, and being hunted by land predators. We think of fish \nas completely aquatic animals. But the walking catfish is just one \nof hundreds of fish species that are actually amphibious, meaning that they possess adaptations \nthat enable them to survive on land. Fish amphibiousness is a spectrum. At one end are species \nlike the mosquitofish that’ll only move on land when forced. And at the other end \nare species like mudskippers that nonchalantly hop around mudflats \nfor days at a time. But why do fish make the exodus \nfrom water to land? And how do they cope \nwith this drastic transition? If temperatures get too high \nfor the mangrove rivulus in the shallow tropical pools \nit inhabits, it’ll flip itself onto a bank \nand cool off in the shade. During the dry period, it can survive for two months \nout of the water by staying in moist environments. Meanwhile, the eel catfish \nmakes its onshore voyage to satisfy its hearty craving for beetles. And for others, the terrestrial draw \nis more ritualistic. Every year under the cover of night, masses of California grunion flop \ntheir way onto sandy beaches, where females deposit thousands of eggs \ninto the sand before re-entering the ocean. Underwater, fish breathe with gills, which are feathery organs \npacked with blood vessels that absorb dissolved oxygen \nfrom the water. But in the open air, their gills collapse \nand are rendered useless, so amphibious fishes need \nother ways to breathe. The armored catfish’s stomach \nis packed with blood vessels, so it can gulp down air \nand breathe through its stomach lining. And lungfish, being related \nto the ancestors of all tetrapods, or four-limbed vertebrates, \nare equipped with true lungs. They’ll actually drown \nif they’re kept underwater too long. Fish have thin, permeable skin \nthat allows for essential compounds to diffuse into and out of their bodies \nwhile they’re underwater. But this works against them on land \nas their bodily moisture diffuses into the air. To dodge dehydration, mudskippers \nroll in the mud like puppies. But the lungfish takes the cake: the rivers it inhabits disappear \nduring dry seasons, so it buries itself in the earth\nand coats its body in a mucus cocoon. It can survive like this for years \nuntil being resuscitated by the next big rainstorm. Amphibious fishes use powerful fins \nto move on land and clever tools to navigate as they go. The Nopoli rock-climbing goby, \nno bigger than a few centimeters, scales hundred-meter-tall \nHawaiian waterfalls, inching its way up by alternately \nattaching the suction cups on its mouth and pelvic fins. To find water while on land, \nthe mummichog, like most amphibious fishes, \nis on the lookout for reflective surfaces. Other species, like mosquitofish, exercise their inner ear to determine \nwhere they’re oriented on a slope, relying on the probability that they’ll \nfind water by moving downhill. Our walking catfish, meanwhile, uses the taste buds that coat \nits body for navigation. These taste buds are concentrated \nin its whiskers, which whip through the air, sensing compounds that signal \nthe proximity and quality of nearby water— and prey. The walking catfish will shimmy towards \nattractive volatile amino acids while steering clear of foul waters \nemanating hydrogen sulfide. While amphibious fishes face a multitude \nof new challenges upon leaving the water, they’ve evolved ingenious ways \nto overcome them. They’re resilient in the face \nof droughts and floods and have access to new prey \nas well as a plan B if they need to escape competitive, \npolluted, or unhealthy environments. While being a “fish out of water” \nis generally regarded as a bad thing, for these species, \nit offers an undisputed edge."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Armored catfish breathe air using their", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gills"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stomach"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lungs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Skin"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these are not a challenge that fish face out of the water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Maintaining buoyancy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Land predators"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Breathing air"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Physical damage like scrapes"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Mudskippers stay moist out of water by", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Coating themselves in mucus cocoons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Having thick scales that prevent water from evaporating through their skin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Living in damp logs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rolling around in the mud"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which sense do fish use to orient out of the water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vision"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Taste"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Balance"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which is not a reason for emersion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water is too hot"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Poor water quality"}, {"label": "C", "text": "High air pressure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To access new sources of food"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 9, "lesson": 6, "title": "How to outsmart the Prisoner’s Dilemma - Lucas Husted", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-outsmart-the-prisoner-s-dilemma-lucas-husted", "transcript": {"en": "Two perfectly rational gingerbread men,\nCrispy and Chewy, are out strolling \nwhen they’re caught by a fox. Seeing how happy they are, \nhe decides that, instead of simply eating them, he’ll put their friendship \nto the test with a cruel dilemma. He’ll ask each gingerbread man whether\nhe’d opt to Spare or Sacrifice the other. They can discuss, but neither will know what the other\nchose until their decisions are locked in. If both choose to spare the other, the fox\nwill eat just one of each of their limbs; if one chooses to spare \nwhile the other sacrifices, the sparer will be fully eaten, while the traitor will run away\nwith all his limbs intact. Finally, if both choose to sacrifice,\nthe fox will eat 3 limbs from each. In game theory, this scenario \nis called the “Prisoner's Dilemma.” To figure out how these gingerbread men \nwill act in their perfect rationality, we can map the outcomes of each decision. The rows represent Crispy’s choices,\nand the columns are Chewy’s. Meanwhile, the numbers in each cell represent the outcomes \nof their decisions, as measured in the number \nof limbs each would keep: So do we expect their friendship \nto last the game? First, let’s consider Chewy’s options. If Crispy spares him, Chewy can run\naway scot-free by sacrificing Crispy. But if Crispy sacrifices him, Chewy can keep one of his limbs\nif he also sacrifices Crispy. No matter what Crispy decides, Chewy always experiences the best outcome\nby choosing to sacrifice his companion. The same is true for Crispy. This is the standard conclusion\nof the Prisoner's Dilemma: the two characters will\nbetray one another. Their strategy to unconditionally\nsacrifice their companion is what game theorists\ncall the “Nash Equilibrium,\" meaning that neither can gain\nby deviating from it. Crispy and Chewy act accordingly and the smug fox runs off \nwith a belly full of gingerbread, leaving the two former friends\nwith just one leg to stand on. Normally, this is where\nthe story would end, but a wizard happened to be watching\nthe whole mess unfold. He tells Crispy and Chewy that, \nas punishment for betraying each other, they’re doomed to repeat this dilemma\nfor the rest of their lives, starting with all four limbs\nat each sunrise. Now what happens? This is called an Infinite Prisoner’s \nDilemma, and it’s a literal game changer. That’s because the gingerbread men \ncan now use their future decisions as bargaining chips for the present ones. Consider this strategy: both agree \nto spare each other every day. If one ever chooses to sacrifice, the other will retaliate by choosing \n“sacrifice” for the rest of eternity. So is that enough to get these\npoor sentient baked goods to agree to cooperate? To figure that out, we have to factor\nin another consideration: the gingerbread men probably care\nabout the future less than they care about the present. In other words, they might discount how much they care about their future\nlimbs by some number, which we’ll call delta. This is similar to the idea of inflation \neroding the value of money. If delta is one half, on day one they care about day 2 limbs\nhalf as much as day 1 limbs, day 3 limbs 1 quarter as much \nas day 1 limbs, and so on. A delta of 0 means that they don’t care \nabout their future limbs at all, so they’ll repeat their initial choice\nof mutual sacrifice endlessly. But as delta approaches 1, \nthey’ll do anything possible to avoid the pain of infinite triple limb \nconsumption, which means they’ll choose\nto spare each other. At some point in between\nthey could go either way. We can find out where that point is by writing the infinite series \nthat represents each strategy, setting them equal to each other,\nand solving for delta. That yields 1/3, meaning that as long\nas Crispy and Chewy care about tomorrow at least 1/3 as much as today, it’s optimal for them \nto spare and cooperate forever. This analysis isn’t unique\nto cookies and wizards; we see it play out in real-life situations like trade negotiations\nand international politics. Rational leaders must assume \nthat the decisions they make today will impact those of their adversaries \ntomorrow. Selfishness may win out in the short-term,\nbut with the proper incentives, peaceful cooperation is not only possible,\nbut demonstrably and mathematically ideal. As for the gingerbread men, \ntheir eternity may be pretty crumby, but so long as they go out on a limb, their friendship will never \nagain be half-baked."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "We predict that in the finite prisoner’s dilemma illustrated here:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The gingerbread men will choose to cooperate."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The gingerbread men can cooperate, but only if they agree to it beforehand."}, {"label": "C", "text": "One gingerbread man will cooperate, but the other will sacrifice."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The gingerbread men will never cooperate."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "With a delta discount factor of .25, then $12.00 today is worth _____ to us tomorrow", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "$2.50"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$3.00"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$6.00"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$9.00"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "With a delta of 0, then we know that the gingerbread men will", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Continue to turn on each other in each period, forever."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sometimes cooperate (spare) with each other."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Always cooperate (spare) each other for the rest of time."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It’s not possible to tell without more information."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "With a discount factor higher than 1/3, for the game shown in the video, players have:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Incentive to cooperate because they care about the future less."}, {"label": "B", "text": "No incentive to cooperate because they care about the future less."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Incentive to cooperate because they care about the future more."}, {"label": "D", "text": "No incentive to cooperate because they care about the future more."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If the payoff for sacrificing the other was increased, then all else equal, we expect that the delta required for cooperation will be:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Higher"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lower"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unchanged"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We cannot tell from the information provided"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

By pointing to several of these in order,\nhe created sequences to make requests, answer verbal questions \nfrom human researchers, and refer to objects \nthat weren’t physically present. Kanzi’s exploits ignited immediate \ncontroversy over one question: had Kanzi learned language? What we call language is something \nmore specific than communication. Language is about sharing \nwhat’s in our minds: stories, opinions, questions, \nthe past or future, imagined times or places, ideas. It is fundamentally open-ended, and can be used to say \nan unlimited number of things. Many researchers are convinced \nthat only humans have language, that the calls and gestures other species\nuse to communicate are not language. Each of these calls and gestures generally\ncorresponds to a specific message, for a limited total number of messages that aren’t combined \ninto more complex ideas. For example, a monkey species \nmight have a specific warning call that corresponds to a particular predator,\nlike a snake— but with language, there are countless \nways to say “watch out for the snake.” So far no animal communication seems \nto have the open-endedness of human language. We don’t know for sure what’s going\non in animals’ heads, and it's possible this definition \nof language, or our ways of measuring it,\ndon’t apply to them. But as far as we know, \nonly humans have language. And while humans speak \naround 7,000 distinct languages, any child can learn any language, indicating that the biological machinery\nunderlying language is common to all of us. So what does language mean for humanity? What does it allow us to do, \nand how did we come to have it? Exactly when we acquired this capacity\nis still an open question. Chimps and bonobos \nare our closest living relatives, but the lineage leading to humans \nsplit from the other great apes more than four million years ago. In between, there were many species—\nall of them now extinct, which makes it very difficult to know\nif they had language or anything like it. Great apes give one potential clue \nto the origins of language, though: it may have started as gesture \nrather than speech. Great apes gesture to each other \nin the wild much more freely than they vocalize. Language may have begun to take shape\nduring the Pleistocene, 2 to 3 million years ago, \nwith the emergence of the genus Homo that eventually gave rise \nto our own species, homo sapiens. Brain size tripled, and bipedalism \nfreed the hands for communication. There may have been a transition \nfrom gestural communication to gestural language— from pointing to objects \nand pantomiming actions— to more efficient, abstract signing. The abstraction of gestural communication\nwould have removed the need for visuals, setting the stage for a transition \nto spoken language. That transition would have \nlikely come later, though. Articulate speech depends \non a vocal tract of a particular shape. Even our closest ancestors, \nthe Neanderthals and Denisovans, had vocal tracts that were not optimal, though they likely had \nsome vocal capacity, and possibly even language. Only in humans is the vocal tract optimal. Spoken words free the hands for activities\nsuch as tool use and transport. So it may have been \nthe emergence of speech, not of language itself, that led \nto the dominance of our species. Language is so intimately tied to complex\nthought, perception, and motor functions that it’s difficult to untangle\nits biological origins. Some of the biggest mysteries remain: to what extent did language \nas a capacity shape humanity, and to what extent did humanity \nshape language?

{"page": 9, "lesson": 8, "title": "How to change your behavior for the better - Dan Ariely", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/VVepIGKr", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Camille Martínez Hi. You might have noticed\nthat I have half a beard. It's not because I lost a bet. Many years ago, I was badly burned. Most of my body is covered with scars, including the right side of my face. I just don't have hair.\nThat's just how it happened. It looks symmetrical, but almost. Anyway, now that we discussed facial hair, let's move to social science. And in particular, I want us to think\nabout where is the potential for humanity and where we are now. And if you think about it,\nthere's a big gap between where we think we could be\nand where we are, and it's in all kinds of areas. So let me ask you: How many of you in the last month\nhave eaten more than you think you should? Just kind of general. OK. How many of you in the last month have\nexercised less than you think you should? OK, and for how many of you\nhas raising your hands twice been the most exercise you got today? (Laughter) How many of you have ever\ntexted while driving? OK, we're getting honest.\nLet's test your honesty. How many people here in the last month have not always washed your hands\nwhen you left the bathroom? (Laughter) A little less honest. By the way, it's interesting how we're\nwilling to admit texting and driving but not washing our hands,\nthat's difficult. (Laughter) We can go on and on. The problem, the topic is\nthat there's lots of things when we know what we could do -- we could be very, very different,\nbut we're acting in a very different way. And when we think\nhow do we bridge that gap, the usual answer is, \"Just tell people.\" For example, just tell people\nthat texting and driving is dangerous. Did you know it's dangerous?\nYou should stop doing it. You tell people something\nis dangerous, and they will stop. Texting and driving is one example. Another very sad example\nis that in the US, we spend between seven\nand eight hundred million dollars a year on what's called \"financial literacy.\" And what do we get\nas a consequence of that? There was recently a study that looked\nat all the research ever to be conducted on financial literacy --\nwhat's called a meta-analysis. And what they found is that\nwhen you tell people, you teach them financial literacy, they learn and they remember. But do people execute? Not so much. The improvement is about\nthree or four percent immediately after the course, and then it goes down. And at the end of the day, the improvement is about 0.1 percent -- not zero, but as humanly close\nto zero as possible. (Laughter) So that's the sad news. The sad news is, giving\ninformation to people is just not a good recipe\nto change behavior. What is? Well, social science\nhas made lots of strides, and the basic insight is that\nif we want to change behavior, we have to change the environment. The right way is not to change people,\nit's to change the environment. And I want to present a very simpleminded\nmodel of how to think about it: it's to think about behavioral change in the same way that we think about\nsending a rocket to space. When we think about\nsending a rocket to space, we want to do two main things. The first one is to reduce friction. We want to take the rocket\nand have as little friction as possible so it's the most aerodynamic possible. And the second thing is we want\nto load as much fuel as possible, to give it the most amount\nof motivation, energy to do its task. And behavior change is the same thing. So let's first talk about friction. In this particular case study\nI'll tell you about, there's a pharmacy, an online pharmacy. Imagine you go to your doctor. You have a long-term illness, your doctor prescribes\nto you a medication, you sign up for this online pharmacy and you get your medication\nin the mail every 90 days. Every 90 days, medication,\nmedication, medication. And this online pharmacy\nwants to switch people from branded medication\nto generic medication. So they send people letters, and they say, \"Please, please, please,\nswitch to generics. You will save money, we will save money,\nyour employer will save money.\" And what do people do? Nothing. So they try all kinds of things\nand nothing happens. So for one year, they give people\nan amazing offer. They send people a letter, and they say, \"If you switch to generics now,\nit will be free for a whole year.\" Free for a whole year. Amazing! What percentage of people\ndo you think switched? Less than 10 percent. At this point, they show up to my office. And they come to complain. Why did they pick me? I wrote a couple of papers\non the \"allure of free.\" In those papers, we showed\nthat if you reduce the price of something for, let's say, 10 cents to one cent,\nnothing much happens. You reduce it from one cent to zero,\nnow people get excited. (Laughter) And they said, \"Look, we read these\npapers on 'free,' we gave 'free.' Not working as we expected. What's going on?\" I said, \"You know, maybe\nit's a question of friction.\" They said, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"People are starting with branded. They can do nothing and end with branded. To move to generic, they have to choose\ngeneric over branded, but they also have to do something. They have to return the letter.\" So this is what we call\na \"confounded design.\" Two things are happening at the same time. It's branded versus generic, but it's doing nothing\nversus doing something. So I said, \"Why don't we switch it? Why don't we send people a letter\nand say, 'We're switching you to generics. You don't need to do anything. If you want to stay with branded,\nplease return the letter.'\" (Laughter) Right? What do you think happened? Lawyers, lawyers happened. (Laughter) It turns out, this is illegal. (Laughter) By the way, for brainstorming\nand creativity, doing things that are illegal\nand immoral, it's fine, as long as it's just\nin the brainstorming phase. (Laughter) But this was the purity of the idea, because the initial design was\nthe branded had the no-action benefit. In my illegal, immoral design,\ngeneric had the no-action benefit. But they agreed to give people\na T-intersection: send people a letter and say, \"If you don't return this letter, we will be forced\nto stop your medications. But when you return the letter,\nyou could choose branded at this price, generic at this price.\" Now people had to take an action. They were on even footing. Right? It wasn't that one had\nthe no-action benefit. What percentage do you think switched? The vast majority switched. So what does it tell us? Do people like generics,\nor do we like branded? We hate returning letters. (Laughter) This is the story of friction:\nsmall things really matter. And friction is about taking\nthe desired behavior and saying: Where do we have\ntoo much friction so it's slowing people down\nfrom acting on it? And every time you see\nthat the desired behavior and the easy behavior are not aligned, it means we want to try and realign them. That's the first part.\nWe talked about friction. Now let's talk about motivation. In this particular study, we were trying to get very poor people\nin a slum called Kibera in Kenya to save a little bit of money\nfor a rainy day. You know, if you're very, very poor,\nyou have no extra money, you live hand to mouth, and from time to time, bad things happen. And when something bad happens,\nyou have nothing to draw on, you borrow. The Kibera people can borrow at sometimes\nup to 10 percent interest a week. And then, of course,\nit's really hard to get out of it. You live hand to mouth,\nsomething bad happens, you borrow, things get worse\nand worse and worse. So we wanted people to keep\na little bit of money for a rainy day. And we thought about\nwhat is the motivation, what is the fuel that we need to add? And we tried all kinds of things. Some people, we texted them\nonce a week and said, \"Please try to save 100 shillings\" --\nabout a dollar -- \"this week.\" Some people, we sent a text message\nas if it came from their kids. So it said, \"Hi Mom, hi Dad,\nthis is little Joey\" -- whatever the name of the kid was -- \"Try and save 100 shillings this week\nfor the future of our family.\" Right? I'm Jewish, a little bit\nof guilt always works. (Laughter) Some people got 10 percent. \"Save up to a hundred shillings,\nwe'll give you 10 percent.\" Some people got 20 percent. Some people got also\n10 percent and 20 percent, but they got it with loss aversion. What is loss aversion? Loss aversion is the idea\nthat we hate losing more than we enjoy gaining. Now, think about somebody\nwho is in a 10-percent condition and they put 40 shillings in. They put 40 shillings,\nwe give them four more, they say thank you very much. That person gave up six. They could have gotten six more\nif they gave a hundred, but they don't see it. So we created what we call pre-match. We put the 10 shillings in\nat the beginning of the week. We said, \"It's waiting for you!\" And then if somebody puts 40 in,\nwe say, \"Oh, you put 40 in, we're leaving four,\nand we're taking six back.\" So in both cases, pre-match or post-match, people get 10 percent. But in the pre-match, they see the money they did not match\nleaving their account. So we have text, text from kids,\n10 percent, 20 percent, pre-match, post-match. And we had one more condition. It was a coin about this size, with 24 numbers written on it. And we asked them to put the coin\nsomewhere in their hut, and every week, take a knife\nand scratch the number for that week -- week one, two, three, four -- scratch it like a minus\nif they didn't save and scratch it up and down if they saved. Now, think to yourself: Which one of those methods\ndo you think worked the best? Text, text from the kids,\n10 percent, 20 percent, beginning of the week,\nend of the week, and the coin? I'll tell you what\nthe average people think. We've done these studies of prediction, both in the US and in Kenya. People think that 20 percent\nwill get a lot of action, 10 percent less, the rest of it will do nothing -- kids, coin, doesn't matter. People think loss aversion\nwill have a small effect. What actually happened? Sending a text reminder once a week helps a lot. Good news! This program lasted six months.\nPeople forget. Reminding people is great. Ten percent at the end\nof the week helped some more. Financial incentives work. Twenty percent at the end of the week --\njust like 10 percent, no difference. Ten percent in the beginning of the week helps some more. Loss aversion works. Twenty percent in\nthe beginning of the week, just like 10 percent in the beginning\nof the week, no difference. And the text message from the kids\nwas just as effective as 20 percent plus loss aversion -- which is amazing, right? It's amazing how motivating\nmessages from kids were. And one conclusion is\nwe don't use kids enough. (Laughter) And, of course, I don't mean\nin a child labor sense. But if you think about\nparents and their kids, we are the best that we can for our kids, and we think about the future, and I think we should think about how to use that amazing\nsource of motivation to get parents to behave in a better way. But the big surprise\nof this study was the coin. The coin basically doubled savings\ncompared to everything else. And now the question is: Why?\nWhat was it about the coin? So I'll tell you how I started\nthinking about the coin, and then we'll come back to it. So you know, when I do research\non, let's say, buying coffee, I don't need to go anywhere.\nI can sit in my office. I've bought enough coffee.\nI know how it works. The details, I'm familiar with. When you do research in some\nof the poorest places in the world, you have to go and visit\nand see what's going on and get some insight\nabout how the system works. And on that particular day, I'm in a place called Soweto\nin South Africa, and I'm sitting in a place\nthat sells funeral insurance. You know, in the US people spend\ncrazy amounts of money on weddings? In South Africa, it's funerals. People spend up to a year\nor two years of income on funerals. And I sit in this place -- by the way, before you judge the South\nAfricans as being irrational with this, I just want to remind you that spending a lot of money\non funerals compared to weddings, at least you know for sure\nyou only have one. (Laughter) OK, so I sit in this place\nthat sells funeral insurance. And this guy comes in with his son --\nhis son is about 12 -- and he buys funeral insurance for a week. It will cover 90 percent\nof his funeral expense only if he dies in the next seven days. Right? These are very poor people,\nthey buy small amounts of insurance and small amount of soap and such. And he gets that certificate, and in a very ceremonious way,\nhe gives it to his son. And as he gives it to his son,\nI think to myself, why the ceremony? What is this father doing? Now, think about the breadwinner\nthat decides on that particular day to direct some money\ninto insurance or savings. What is the family going to see tonight? They're going to see less. Right? At that level of poverty, there'll\nbe less food, less kerosene, less water -- something less tonight. And what his father was doing\nand what our coin was trying to do is to say, yes, there's less\nfood on the table, but there's another activity. You see, what happened is, there are\nmany good, important economic activities, like savings and insurance,\nthat are invisible. And now the question is:\nHow do we make them visible? So let's go back to our rocket model. We have to, first of all,\nlook at the system and see where there's little things\nwe can fix, with friction, where is there\nthat we can remove friction? And then the next thing we want to do\nis to think broadly about the system, and say: What other motivations\ncan we bring in? And that's a much more difficult exercise, and we don't always know\nwhat would work best. Is it going to be money?\nIs it going to be loss aversion? Is it going to be\nsomething that is visible? We don't know, and we have\nto try different things. We also have to realize that\nour intuition sometimes misleads us. We don't always necessarily know\nwhat would work the best. So if we think about this gap between where we could be\nand where we are, it's a really sad thing to see this gap\nand to think about it. But the good news is,\nthere's lots we can do. Some of the changes are easy,\nsome of the changes are more complex. But if we'll attack each problem directly, not by just providing\nmore information to people but trying to change the friction, add motivation, I think we can ... Can we close the gap? No. But can we get much better?\nAbsolutely, yes. Thank you very much.

At the time of this video’s publication, these are the last two known \nnorthern white rhinos left on Earth. Their species is functionally extinct— without a male, \nNájin and Fatu can’t reproduce. And yet, there’s still hope to revive \nthe northern white rhino. How can that be? The story starts about 50 years ago, when poachers began illegally hunting \nthousands of rhinos across Africa for their horns. This, combined with civil wars \nin their territory, decimated northern white rhino \npopulations. Concerned conservationists began trying \nto breed them in captivity in the 1970s, collecting and storing semen from males. Only four rhinos were ultimately born \nthrough the ambitious breeding program. Nájin, and her daughter Fatu \nwere the last two. In 2014, conservationists discovered \nthat neither can have a calf. Though Nájin gave birth to Fatu, \nshe now has weak hindlegs, which could harm her health \nif she became pregnant again. Fatu, meanwhile, \nhas a degenerated uterine lining. Then, the last northern white rhino male \nof the species, Sudan, died in 2018. But there was one glimmer of hope: \nartificial reproduction. With no living males and no females \nable to carry a pregnancy, this is a complicated and risky process \nto say the least. Though scientists had stored semen, \nthey would have to collect the eggs— a complex procedure that requires a female\nto be sedated for up to two hours. Then, they’d create a viable embryo \nin the lab— something that had never been done before,\nand no one knew how to do. Even that was just the beginning— a surrogate mother \nof another rhino species would have to carry the embryo to term. Females of a closely related species, \nthe southern white rhino, became both the key to developing \na rhino embryo in a lab and the leading candidates \nfor surrogate mothers. Northern and southern white rhinos \ndiverged about a million of years ago into separate— though still \nclosely-related— species. They inhabit different regions, and have \nslightly different physical traits. In a fortunate coincidence, \nseveral female southern white rhinos needed treatment \nfor their own reproductive problems, and researchers could collect eggs \nas part of that treatment. In Dvůr Králové Zoo in October 2015, experts of IZW Berlin began collecting \neggs from southern white rhinos and sending them to Avantea, an animal \nreproduction laboratory in Italy. There, scientists developed and perfected \na technique to create a viable embryo. Once they mastered the technique, researchers extracted Nájin and Fatu’s \neggs on August 22, 2019 and flew them to Italy. Three days later, they fertilized \nthe eggs with sperm from a northern white rhino male. After another week, two of the eggs \nmade it to the stage of development when the embryo can be frozen \nand preserved for future. Another collection in December 2019 \nproduced one more embryo. As of early 2020, the plan is to collect \nNájin and Fatu’s eggs three times a year if they’re healthy enough. In the meantime, \nresearchers are looking for promising southern white rhino \nsurrogate mothers— ideally who’ve carried a pregnancy \nto term before. The surrogacy plan \nis somewhat of a leap of faith— southern and northern white rhinos \nhave interbred both during the last glacial period \nand more recently in 1977, so researchers are optimistic \na southern white rhino would be able to carry \na northern white rhino to term. Also, the two species’ pregnancies \nare the same length. Still, transferring an embryo \nto a rhino is tricky because of the shape of the cervix. The ultimate goal, \nwhich will take decades, is to establish a breeding population \nof northern white rhinos in their original range. Studies suggest that we have samples \nfrom enough individuals to recreate a population with the genetic \ndiversity the species had a century ago. Though the specifics \nof this effort are unique, as more species face critical endangerment\nor functional extinction, it’s also an arena for big questions: do we have a responsibility to try \nto bring species back from the brink, especially when human actions \nbrought them there in the first place? Are there limits to the effort \nwe should expend on saving animals threatened \nwith extinction?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many northern white rhinos were born and raised in human care?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "none"}, {"label": "B", "text": "four"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fourteen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "forty"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The last northern white rhino male died in 2018.

The army in question belonged \nto Queen Meadhbh of Connaught. Enraged at her husband’s possession\nof a white bull of awesome strength, she had set out to capture \nthe fabled brown bull of Ulster at any cost. Unfortunately, the King of Ulster \nhad chosen this moment to force the goddess Macha to race \nher chariot while pregnant. In retaliation, she struck down him \nand his entire army with stomach cramps that eerily resembled childbirth—\nall except Cú Chulainn. Though he was the best warrior in Ulster, Cú Chulainn knew he could not take on\nQueen Meadhbh’s whole army at once. He invoked the sacred rite \nof single combat in order to fight \nthe intruders one by one. But as Queen Meadhbh’s army \napproached, one thing worried him \nmore than the grueling ordeal ahead. Years before, Cú Chulainn had travelled \nto Scotland to train with the renowned \nwarrior Scáthach. There, he met a young warrior \nfrom Connaught named Ferdiad. They lived and trained side-by-side,\nand soon became close friends. When they returned \nto their respective homes, Cú Chulainn and Ferdiad found themselves \non opposite sides of a war. Cú Chulainn knew Ferdiad \nwas marching in Meadhbh’s army, and that if he succeeded \nin fending off her troops, they would eventually meet. Day after day, Cú Chulainn \ndefended Ulster alone. He sent the heads of some \nof his adversaries back to Meadhbh’s camp, while the rushing waters of the ford \ncarried others away. At times, he slipped into a trance \nand slayed hundreds of soldiers in a row. Whenever he saw the queen in the distance,\nhe hurled stones at her— never quite hitting her, but once coming close enough \nto knock a squirrel off her shoulder. Back at the Connaught camp, \nFerdiad was laying low, doing everything he could \nto avoid the moment when he’d have to face\nhis best friend in combat. But the Queen was impatient \nto get her hands on the prize bull, and she knew Ferdiad was \nher best chance to defeat Cú Chulainn. So she goaded him \nand questioned his honor until he had no choice but to fight. The two faced off at the ford, matching \neach other exactly in strength and skill no matter what weapons they used. Then, on the third day of their fight,\nFerdiad began to gain the upper hand over the exhausted Cu Chulainn. But Cú Chulainn had one last trick \nup his sleeve: their teacher had shared \na secret with him alone. She told him how \nto summon the Gáe Bulg, a magical spear fashioned \nfrom the bones of sea monsters that lay at the bottom of the ocean. Cu Chulainn called the spear, \nstabbed Ferdiad to death, and collapsed. Meadhbh seized her chance \nand swooped in with the rest of her army to capture the brown bull. At last, the men of Ulster were recovering\nfrom their magical illness, and they surged out in pursuit. But they were too late: Queen Meadhbh\ncrossed the border unscathed, dragging the brown bull with her. Once home, Meadhbh \ndemanded another battle, this time between the brown bull \nand her husband’s white bull. The bulls were well matched, \nand struggled into the night, dragging each other all over Ireland. At long last, the brown bull \nkilled the white bull, and Queen Meadhbh was finally satisfied. But the brown bull’s victory \nmeant nothing to him. He was tired, injured, and devastated.

Named for their vibrant scales \nand beak-like teeth, these parrotfish are devouring \na particularly crunchy breakfast: rocks. It may not be immediately clear \nwhy any creature would take bites out of the seafloor. But the diet of these flashy foragers \nactually plays a key role in defending the coral reef’s \ncomplex ecosystem. Massive coral reefs \nbegin with tiny coral larvae, which settle on the seafloor’s \nhard surfaces and metamorphasize into coral polyps. Over time, these polyps \ngenerate rock-like skeletons made of calcium carbonate. Together, colonies of polyps produce \nlarge three-dimensional structures, which form the basis \nof an underwater metropolis. These coral complexes are full \nof nooks and crannies that house and protect \ncountless life forms. Even though coral reefs occupy less than \none percent of the ocean floor, these dense ecosystems are home to more \nthan twenty-five percent of marine life. Many fish use corals as shelters for \nsleeping and to hide from large predators between their trips foraging for seaweed. As the primary food source for many \nof the reef’s fish and invertebrates, seaweed is vital to this ecosystem. But in high densities, \nseaweed can become problematic, and even lethal to corals. Seaweed grows on the same hard open \nsurfaces that coral larvae rely on, and their growth prevents new coral \nfrom settling and expanding. These competitors have also evolved \na variety of ways to kill existing corals, including smothering and abrasion. Some seaweed species \neven engage in chemical warfare— synthesizing compounds \nthat destroy coral on contact. This is where parrotfish come in. Like many reef fish, \nthese colorful creatures eat seaweed. But unlike their neighbors, parrotfish can completely remove \neven the tiniest scraps of seaweed from the ocean floor. Their so-called beak is actually a mosaic \nof tightly-packed teeth which can scrape and grind rock, allowing them to consume every bit \nof seaweed covering a stony surface. This helps parrotfish reach seaweed \nother fish can’t consume, while simultaneously clearing out \nopen space for new corals to settle and existing colonies to expand. Eating rocks is just one way parrotfish \nhelp manage seaweed. Through a dynamic system \nof social networks, parrotfish can convey information \nto other coral dwelling fish. Each fish’s presence and simple routine \nbehaviors produce sensory information that nearby fish can see, hear, or smell. They can even detect changes in water \npressure produced by their neighbors using a special sensory organ. All these factors can inform \nthe behavior of nearby fish. For example, a fish safely entering \nan open feeding ground and not getting attacked \nmeans it’s safe to forage. Conversely, a fish rapidly leaving \na location can provide an early warning that a threat is approaching. By simply trying to stay alive, these reef fish can incidentally help \ntheir neighbors survive— and more of these fish \nmeans less seaweed. Unfortunately, human activities \nover the last several decades have disrupted almost every part \nof this complex system. In many coral reefs, overfishing \nhas reduced the number of parrotfish, as well as other seaweed eaters, \nsuch as surgeonfish and rabbitfish. This has led to unchecked seaweed growth, which threatens to degrade \nentire coral reefs. The parrotfish that remain \nlive in much smaller communities. Their reduced numbers \ncan weaken their social network, making surviving fish more timid \nand less effective at controlling seaweed. Today, climate change and pollution \nare lowering coral’s natural defenses while contributing to runaway \nseaweed growth— leaving reef ecosystems \nmore fragile than ever. Our reefs are vitally important \nto both marine and human life. Their unparalleled biodiversity offers \nunique opportunities for ecotourism, sustainable fishing, \nand scientific research, while their rocky structures guard \ncoastlines from waves and storm surges.

They took everything we know \nabout our solar system and calculated where every planet would be\nup to 5 billion years in the future. To do so they ran over 2,000 \nnumerical simulations with the same exact initial conditions\nexcept for one difference: the distance between Mercury and the Sun,\nmodified by less than a millimeter from one simulation to the next. Shockingly, in about 1 percent \nof their simulations, Mercury’s orbit changed so drastically \nthat it could plunge into the Sun or collide with Venus. Worse yet, in one simulation it destabilized\nthe entire inner solar system. This was no error; \nthe astonishing variety in results reveals the truth that our solar system \nmay be much less stable than it seems. Astrophysicists refer to this astonishing\nproperty of gravitational systems as the n-body problem. While we have equations \nthat can completely predict the motions of two gravitating masses, our analytical tools fall short \nwhen faced with more populated systems. It’s actually impossible to write down\nall the terms of a general formula that can exactly describe the motion\nof three or more gravitating objects. Why? The issue lies in how many unknown\nvariables an n-body system contains. Thanks to Isaac Newton, \nwe can write a set of equations to describe the gravitational force \nacting between bodies. However, when trying to find a general \nsolution for the unknown variables in these equations, we’re faced with \na mathematical constraint: for each unknown, \nthere must be at least one equation that independently describes it. Initially, a two-body system appears \nto have more unknown variables for position and velocity \nthan equations of motion. However, there’s a trick: consider the relative position \nand velocity of the two bodies with respect to the center \nof gravity of the system. This reduces the number of unknowns\nand leaves us with a solvable system. With three or more orbiting objects \nin the picture, everything gets messier. Even with the same mathematical trick \nof considering relative motions, we’re left with more unknowns \nthan equations describing them. There are simply too many variables\nfor this system of equations to be untangled into a general solution. But what does it actually look like \nfor objects in our universe to move according to analytically \nunsolvable equations of motion? A system of three stars—\nlike Alpha Centauri— could come crashing\ninto one another or, more likely, some might get flung out of orbit \nafter a long time of apparent stability. Other than a few highly improbable \nstable configurations, almost every possible case \nis unpredictable on long timescales. Each has an astronomically large range\nof potential outcomes, dependent on the tiniest of differences\nin position and velocity. This behaviour is known \nas chaotic by physicists, and is an important characteristic \nof n-body systems. Such a system is still deterministic—\nmeaning there’s nothing random about it. If multiple systems start \nfrom the exact same conditions, they’ll always reach the same result. But give one a little shove at the start,\nand all bets are off. That’s clearly relevant \nfor human space missions, when complicated orbits need \nto be calculated with great precision. Thankfully, continuous advancements\nin computer simulations offer a number of ways\nto avoid catastrophe. By approximating the solutions \nwith increasingly powerful processors, we can more confidently predict the motion\nof n-body systems on long time-scales. And if one body in a group \nof three is so light it exerts no significant force \non the other two, the system behaves, with very good \napproximation, as a two-body system. This approach is known \nas the “restricted three-body problem.” It proves extremely useful \nin describing, for example, an asteroid in the Earth-Sun \ngravitational field, or a small planet in the field \nof a black hole and a star. As for our solar system, \nyou’ll be happy to hear that we can have reasonable confidence\nin its stability for at least the next \nseveral hundred million years.

Once the bees have transformed \nevery hex in a hive, you can place an additional bee inside\nand it’ll specialize into a queen. The hive, if well cared for, \nwill eventually produce new bees and continue the species. If there are no hexes with three or more \ntransformed neighbors, the bees will just sit and wait. And once a bee transforms a hex, \nit can never become a queen. You could put 59 bees in one wire hive,\nwait till they transform all the hexes, and then create a queen. But then just one collapse \nwould end the species. The more viable hives \nyou can make now, the better. So how many can you make with 60 bees? Pause the video to figure\nit out yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Answer in 0 What you're looking for here is some \nkind of self-sustaining chain reaction, where a small number of bees \nwill transform an entire hive. The lower the number of bees needed,\nthe better. So how low can we go, \nand how can we engineer a chain reaction? Let’s start with the first question. There's a really clever approach to this, which involves counting the sides \nof the filled-in hexes, and examining their total perimeter. Let’s suppose we put bees \nin these three hexes. The total transformed \nperimeter has 18 sides. But the middle hex \nhas three transformed neighbors, so the bees will transform it too. What happens to the perimeter? It’s still 18! And even after the bees transform the next\nsets of hexes with three neighbors, it still won’t change. What’s going on here? Each hex that has at least three sides \ntouching the bee-friendly space will remove those sides from the perimeter\nwhen it transforms. Then it adds at most three new sides \nto the perimeter. So the perimeter of the transformed hexes\nwill either stay the same or shrink. The final perimeter \nof the entire hive is 54, so the total perimeter of the hexes \nwe place bees in at the start must be at least 54 as well. Dividing that 54 by the six sides \non each non-adjacent hex tells us it’ll take at least 9 bees \nto transform the entire hive. That’s a great start, but we still have the tough question \nof where the nine bees should go, and if we’ll need more. Let’s think smaller. We already know that three bees could\ncompletely transform a hive this big. What about a slightly bigger one? The perimeter of this hive is 30, which means we’ll need \nat least 5 bees to fill it in. With 6 it’d be easy. Placing them like this would fill out \nthe whole hive in just three steps. But we can do better! We don’t actually need to place \na bee on this hex, since the other bees will transform\nthat spot on their own. It looks like we have \nthe beginning of a pattern. Can we extend it to our full hive? That would mean placing \nour 9 bees like so. Once they get to work, \nthey’ll create a chain reaction that fills in the center of the hive \nand extend it to its edges. Add a 10th bee to the completed hive \nand it becomes a queen. Repeat that process five more times and you’ve helped the last 60 members\nof Apis trifecta create 6 producing hives. All in all, \nit’s a pretty good bee-ginning."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many bees do you have in your terrarium?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50"}, {"label": "B", "text": "60"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How do you make a queen?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Feed it royal jelly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Place it in a developing hive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Place it in a completed hive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Specialize a worker once a hive is complete"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many transformed hexes must a hex neighbor in order for the bees to transform it too?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What other property of the hives ends up being helpful to examine?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Perimeter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Area"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Volume"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Honey production"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "If a single bee is placed into a hive, how many hexes will it transform on its own?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Your product is now sold \nin stores worldwide. But you’ve recently received awful news: three unrelated people in one city died\nafter eating your burgers. The police concluded that a criminal \ntargeted your brand, injecting poison into your product \nin at least two grocery stores. The culprit used an ultrafine instrument \nthat left no trace on the packaging, making it impossible to determine \nwhich products were compromised. Your burgers were immediately\nremoved from the two stores where the victims bought them. The deaths are headline news, the killer is still at large, \nand sales have plummeted. You must quickly develop a strategy \nto deal with the crisis. Your team comes up with three options: 1. Do nothing. 2. Pull the products from grocery stores \ncitywide and destroy them. Or 3. Pull and destroy \nthe product worldwide. Which do you choose? Your company lawyer explains \nthat a recall is not required by law because the criminal is fully responsible. She recommends the first option— \ndoing nothing— because recalling the product \ncould look like an admission of fault. But is that the most ethical strategy? To gauge the ethicality of each choice, you could perform \na “stakeholder analysis.” This would allow you to weigh \nthe interests of some key stakeholders— investors, employees, and customers—\nagainst one another. With the first option your advisors project that the crisis \nwill eventually blow over. Sales will then improve but probably \nstay below prior levels because of damage to the brand. As a result, you’ll have to lay off \nsome employees, and investors will suffer minor losses. But more customers could die \nif the killer poisoned packages elsewhere. The second option is expensive\nin the short-term and will require greater employee layoffs and additional financial loss \nto investors. But this option is safer \nfor customers in the city and could create enough trust \nthat sales will eventually rebound. The third option is the most expensive \nin the short-term and will require significant \nemployee layoffs and investor losses. Though you have no evidence that these\ncrimes are an international threat, this option provides the greatest\ncustomer protection. Given the conflict between the interests\nof your customers versus those of your investors \nand employees, which strategy is the most ethical? To make this decision, \nyou could consider these tests: First is the Utilitarian Test: Utilitarianism is a philosophy concerned with maximizing the greatest amount \nof good for the greatest number of people. What would be the impact of each\noption on these terms? Second is the Family Test: How would you feel\nexplaining your decision to your family? Third is the Newspaper Test: how would you feel reading about it \non the front page of the local newspaper? And finally, you could use \nthe Mentor Test: If someone you admire were making \nthis decision, what would they do? Johnson & Johnson CEO James Burke \nfaced a similar challenge in 1982 after a criminal added the poison cyanide\nto bottles of Tylenol in Chicago. Seven people died and sales dropped. Industry analysts said \nthe company was done for. In response, Burke decided to pull Tylenol\nfrom all shelves worldwide, citing customer safety \nas the company’s highest priority. Johnson & Johnson recalled and destroyed\nan estimated 32 million bottles of Tylenol valued at 250 million in today’s dollars. 1.5 million of the recalled bottles \nwere tested and 3 of them— all from the Chicago area— were found to contain cyanide. Burke’s decision helped the company \nregain the trust of its customers, and product sales rebounded within a year. Prompted by the Tylenol murders, \nJohnson & Johnson became a leader in developing tamper-resistant packaging and the government instituted \nstricter regulations. The killer, meanwhile, was never caught. Burke’s decision prevented further deaths\nfrom the initial poisoning, but the federal government investigated\nhundreds of copycat tampering incidents involving other products \nin the following weeks. Could these have been prevented \nwith a different response? Was Burke acting in the interest \nof the public or of his company? Was this good ethics or good marketing? As with all ethical dilemmas, \nthis has no clear right or wrong answer.

{"page": 9, "lesson": 15, "title": "How do our brains process speech? - Gareth Gaskell", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-our-brains-process-speech-gareth-gaskell", "transcript": {"en": "The average 20 year old knows \nbetween 27,000 and 52,000 different words. By age 60, that number averages \nbetween 35,000 and 56,000. Spoken out loud, most of these words \nlast less than a second. So with every word, the brain \nhas a quick decision to make: which of those thousands of options \nmatches the signal? About 98% of the time, the brain chooses\nthe correct word. But how? Speech comprehension is different\nfrom reading comprehension, but it’s similar to sign language \ncomprehension— though spoken word recognition \nhas been studied more than sign language. The key to our ability \nto understand speech is the brain’s role \nas a parallel processor, meaning that it can do multiple \ndifferent things at the same time. Most theories assume \nthat each word we know is represented by a separate processing \nunit that has just one job: to assess the likelihood of incoming \nspeech matching that particular word. In the context of the brain, \nthe processing unit that represents a word is likely a pattern of firing activity \nacross a group of neurons in the brain’s cortex. When we hear the beginning of a word, several thousand such units \nmay become active, because with just the beginning \nof a word, there are many possible matches. Then, as the word goes on, \nmore and more units register that some vital piece of information \nis missing and lose activity. Possibly well before the end of the word, just one firing pattern remains active, \ncorresponding to one word. This is called the \"recognition point.\" In the process of honing in on one word, the active units suppress \nthe activity of others, saving vital milliseconds. Most people can comprehend \nup to about 8 syllables per second. Yet, the goal is not only \nto recognize the word, but also to access its stored meaning. The brain accesses many possible meanings\nat the same time, before the word has been fully identified. We know this from studies which show \nthat even upon hearing a word fragment— like \"cap\"— listeners will start to register \nmultiple possible meanings, like captain or capital,\nbefore the full word emerges. This suggests that every time \nwe hear a word there’s a brief explosion of meanings \nin our minds, and by the recognition point the brain \nhas settled on one interpretation. The recognition process moves \nmore rapidly with a sentence that gives us context \nthan in a random string of words. Context also helps guide us towards \nthe intended meaning of words with multiple interpretations, \nlike \"bat,\" or \"crane,\" or in cases of homophones\nlike \"no\" or \"know.\" For multilingual people, the language\nthey are listening to is another cue, used to eliminate potential words\nthat don’t match the language context. So, what about adding completely \nnew words to this system? Even as adults, we may come across \na new word every few days. But if every word is represented \nas a fine-tuned pattern of activity distributed over many neurons, how do we prevent new words \nfrom overwriting old ones? We think that to avoid this problem, new words are initially stored in a part \nof the brain called the hippocampus, well away from the main store \nof words in the cortex, so they don’t share neurons\nwith others words. Then, over multiple nights of sleep, the new words gradually transfer \nover and interweave with old ones. Researchers think this gradual\nacquisition process helps avoid disrupting existing words. So in the daytime, unconscious activity generates explosions\nof meaning as we chat away. At night, we rest, but our brains \nare busy integrating new knowledge into the word network. When we wake up, this process ensures \nthat we’re ready for the ever-changing world of language."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When we listen to speech, how often do we identify the correct word?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "94% of the time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "96% of the time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "98% of the time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100% of the time"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following doesn’t helps us to recognize words quickly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dividing the work of recognition between thousands of different processing units"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Parallel computation in the brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Speaking louder"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Providing a sentence context"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When does the brain start to access the meaning of a word during speech comprehension?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Before the word is identified"}, {"label": "B", "text": "At the moment the word is identified"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100 milliseconds after identification"}, {"label": "D", "text": "At the end of the word"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "On average, how often do adults learn a new word?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Every hour or two"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Every day or two"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Every week or two"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Every month or two"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which part of the brain helps us to learn new words?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The amygdala"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The corpus callosum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ventromedial pre-frontal cortex"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The hippocampus"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

He thought these symbols represented\nthe language spoken by Europe’s oldest civilization. Their meaning would elude scholars \nfor 50 years. Evans discovered these tablets \namid the colorful frescoes and maze-like hallways\nof the palace of Knossos. He called the civilization Minoan— after the mythical Cretan ruler, \nKing Minos. He thought the script, dubbed Linear B,\nrepresented the Minoan language, and scholars all over the world \ncame up with their own theories. Was it the lost language of the Etruscans? Or perhaps it represented \nan early form of Basque? The mystery intensified because Evans\nguarded the tablets closely–– only 200 of the inscriptions \nwere published during his lifetime–– but he couldn’t decipher the script. However, he did make \ntwo accurate observations: the tablets were administrative records,\nand the script was a syllabary, where each symbol represented \nboth a consonant and a vowel, mixed with characters \nthat each represented a whole word. Evans worked on Linear B for three decades\nbefore a scholar from Brooklyn, New York, named Alice Kober \nset out to solve the mystery. Kober was a professor \nof Classics at Brooklyn College when few women held such positions. To help in her quest, she taught herself\nmany languages–– knowledge she knew she would need \nto decipher Linear B. For the next two decades, \nshe analyzed the symbols. Working from the few \navailable inscriptions, she recorded how often \neach symbol appeared. Then she recorded how frequently \neach symbol appeared next to another. She stored her findings on scrap paper \nin cigarette cartons because writing supplies were scarce \nduring the Second World War. By analyzing these frequencies, she discovered that Linear B \nrelied on word endings to give its sentences grammar. From this she began to build a chart \nof the relations between the signs, coming closer than anyone before \nto deciphering Linear B. But she died, probably of cancer, \nin 1950 at the age of 43. While Kober was analyzing \nthe Knossos tablets, an architect named Michael Ventris \nwas also working to crack Linear B. He had become obsessed with Linear B\nas a schoolboy after hearing Evans speak. He even worked on deciphering \nthe script while serving in World War II. After the war, Ventris \nbuilt on Kober’s grid using a newly published cache \nof Linear B inscriptions excavated from a different archeological\nsite called Pylos, on mainland Greece. His real breakthrough came \nwhen he compared the tablets from Pylos with those from Knossos and saw that certain words appeared on\ntablets from one site but not the other. He wondered if those words represented\nthe names of places specific to each location. He knew that over centuries, place names\ntend to remain constant, and decided to compare Linear B to an ancient syllabary \nfrom the island of Cyprus. The Cypriot script was used \nhundreds of years after Linear B, but some of the symbols were similar— he wondered if the sounds \nwould be similar, too. When Ventris plugged some of the sounds \nof the Cypriot syllabary into the Linear B inscriptions, he came up with the word Knossos, the name of the city where Evans \nhad discovered his tablets. In a domino effect, \nVentris unraveled Linear B, with each word revealing more clearly \nthat the language of Linear B was not Minoan, but Greek. Ventris died in a car crash four years \nlater, at the age of 34. But his discovery rewrote \na chapter of history. Evans had insisted that the Minoans \nconquered the mainland Greeks, and that was why examples of Linear B \nwere found on the mainland. But the discovery that Linear B \nrepresented Greek, and not Minoan, showed that the opposite had happened: mainland Greeks invaded Crete and adopted\nthe Minoan script for their own language. But the story isn’t over yet. The actual language of the Minoans, represented by another script \ncalled Linear A, has yet to be deciphered.

However, the sound wasn’t coming \nfrom the sky. The source was a large, smoking crack \nemitting gas and ejecting rocks. This fissure would come to be known as \nthe volcano Paricutin, and over the next 9 years, its lava \nand ash would cover over 200 square km. But where did this new volcano come from, and what triggered \nits unpredictable eruption? The story of any volcano \nbegins with magma. Often, this molten rock forms \nin areas where ocean water is able to slip into the Earth’s mantle \nand lower the layer’s melting point. The resulting magma typically remains \nunder the Earth’s surface thanks to the delicate balance \nof three geological factors. The first is lithostatic pressure. This is the weight of the Earth’s crust \npushing down on the magma below. Magma pushes back with the second factor, \nmagmastatic pressure. The battle between these forces \nstrains the third factor: the rock strength of the Earth’s crust. Usually, the rock is strong enough \nand heavy enough to keep the magma in place. But when this equilibrium is thrown off, \nthe consequences can be explosive. One of the most common causes \nof an eruption is an increase \nin magmastatic pressure. Magma contains various elements \nand compounds, many of which are dissolved \nin the molten rock. At high enough concentrations, compounds \nlike water or sulfur no longer dissolve, and instead form \nhigh-pressure gas bubbles. When these bubbles reach the surface, they can burst with the force \nof a gunshot. And when millions of bubbles \nexplode simultaneously, the energy can send plumes of ash \ninto the stratosphere. But before they pop, they act \nlike bubbles of C02 in a shaken soda. Their presence lowers \nthe magma’s density, and increases the buoyant force \npushing upward through the crust. Many geologists believe this process \nwas behind the Paricutin eruption in Mexico. There are two known natural causes \nfor these buoyant bubbles. Sometimes, new magma \nfrom deeper underground brings additional gassy compounds \ninto the mix. But bubbles can also form \nwhen magma begins to cool. In its molten state, magma is a mixture\nof dissolved gases and melted minerals. As the molten rock hardens, some of those \nminerals solidify into crystals. This process doesn’t incorporate \nmany of the dissolved gasses, resulting in a higher concentration \nof the compounds that form explosive bubbles. Not all eruptions are due \nto rising magmastatic pressure— sometimes the weight of the rock \nabove can become dangerously low. Landslides can remove massive quantities \nof rock from atop a magma chamber, dropping the lithostatic pressure \nand instantly triggering an eruption. This process is known as “unloading” and it’s been responsible \nfor numerous eruptions, including the sudden explosion \nof Mount St. Helens in 1980. But unloading can also happen \nover longer periods of time due to erosion or melting glaciers. In fact, many geologists \nare worried that glacial melt caused by climate change \ncould increase volcanic activity. Finally, eruptions can occur when \nthe rock layer is no longer strong enough to hold back the magma below. Acidic gases and heat escaping from magma can corrode rock through a process \ncalled hydrothermal alteration, gradually turning hard stone \ninto soft clay. The rock layer could also be weakened \nby tectonic activity. Earthquakes can create fissures \nallowing magma to escape to the surface, and the Earth’s crust \ncan be stretched thin as continental plates \nshift away from each other. Unfortunately, knowing \nwhat causes eruptions doesn’t make them easy to predict. While scientists can roughly determine \nthe strength and weight of the Earth’s crust, the depth and heat of magma chambers \nmakes measuring changes in magmastatic pressure very difficult. But volcanologists are constantly \nexploring new technology to conquer this rocky terrain. Advances in thermal imaging \nhave allowed scientists to detect subterranean hotspots. Spectrometers can analyze \ngases escaping magma. And lasers can precisely track the impact \nof rising magma on a volcano’s shape.

I'd approach those people and say, \"Hey, I'm a journalist.\nCan I come watch you do what you do?\" Now, often the response would be, \"Why in hell would I want to talk to some low-t soy-boy\nBrooklyn globalist Jew cuck who's in cahoots with the Democrat Party?\" (Laughter) To which my response would be,\n\"Look, man, that's only 57 percent true.\" (Laughter) But often I got the opposite response. \"Yeah, sure, come on by.\" So that's how I ended up\nin the living room of a social media propagandist\nin Southern California. He was a married white guy\nin his late 30s. He had a table in front of him\nwith a mug of coffee, a laptop for tweeting, a phone for texting and an iPad for livestreaming\nto Periscope and YouTube. That was it. And yet, with those tools, he was able to propel his fringe,\nnoxious talking points into the heart of\nthe American conversation. For example, one of the days I was there, a bomb had just exploded in New York, and the guy accused of planting the bomb\nhad a Muslim-sounding name. Now, to the propagandist in California,\nthis seemed like an opportunity, because one of the things he wanted was for the US to cut off\nalmost all immigration, especially from Muslim-majority countries. So he started livestreaming, getting his followers\nworked up into a frenzy about how the open borders agenda\nwas going to kill us all and asking them to tweet about this, and use specific hashtags, trying to get those hashtags trending. And tweet they did -- hundreds and hundreds of tweets, a lot of them featuring\nimages like this one. So that's George Soros. He's a Hungarian billionaire\nand philanthropist, and in the minds\nof some conspiracists online, George Soros is like\na globalist bogeyman, one of a few elites who is secretly\nmanipulating all of global affairs. Now, just to pause here:\nif this idea sounds familiar to you, that there are a few elites\nwho control the world and a lot of them happen to be rich Jews, that's because it is one of the most\nanti-Semitic tropes in existence. I should also mention that the guy\nin New York who planted that bomb, he was an American citizen. So whatever else was going on there, immigration was not the main issue. And the propagandist in California,\nhe understood all this. He was a well-read guy.\nHe was actually a lawyer. He knew the underlying facts, but he also knew that facts\ndo not drive conversation online. What drives conversation online is emotion. See, the original premise of social media was that it was going\nto bring us all together, make the world more open\nand tolerant and fair ... And it did some of that. But the social media algorithms\nhave never been built to distinguish between\nwhat's true or false, what's good or bad for society,\nwhat's prosocial and what's antisocial. That's just not what those algorithms do. A lot of what they do\nis measure engagement: clicks, comments, shares,\nretweets, that kind of thing. And if you want your content\nto get engagement, it has to spark emotion, specifically, what behavioral scientists\ncall \"high-arousal emotion.\" Now, \"high arousal\" doesn't only\nmean sexual arousal, although it's the internet,\nobviously that works. It means anything, positive or negative,\nthat gets people's hearts pumping. So I would sit with these propagandists, not just the guy in California,\nbut dozens of them, and I would watch as they did this\nagain and again successfully, not because they were Russian hackers,\nnot because they were tech prodigies, not because they had\nunique political insights -- just because they understood\nhow social media worked, and they were willing\nto exploit it to their advantage. Now, at first I was able to tell myself\nthis was a fringe phenomenon, something that was\nrelegated to the internet. But there's really no separation anymore\nbetween the internet and everything else. This is an ad that ran\non multiple TV stations during the 2018 congressional elections, alleging with very little evidence\nthat one of the candidates was in the pocket of\ninternational manipulator George Soros, who is awkwardly photoshopped here\nnext to stacks of cash. This is a tweet from\nthe President of the United States, alleging, again with no evidence, that American politics is being\nmanipulated by George Soros. This stuff that once seemed so shocking\nand marginal and, frankly, just ignorable, it's now so normalized\nthat we hardly even notice it. So I spent about\nthree years in this world. I talked to a lot of people. Some of them seemed to have\nno core beliefs at all. They just seemed to be betting,\nperfectly rationally, that if they wanted\nto make some money online or get some attention online, they should just be\nas outrageous as possible. But I talked to other people\nwho were true ideologues. And to be clear, their ideology\nwas not traditional conservatism. These were people who wanted\nto revoke female suffrage. These were people who wanted\nto go back to racial segregation. Some of them wanted to do away\nwith democracy altogether. Now, obviously these people\nwere not born believing these things. They didn't pick them up\nin elementary school. A lot of them, before they went\ndown some internet rabbit hole, they had been libertarian\nor they had been socialist or they had been something else entirely. So what was going on? Well, I can't generalize about every case, but a lot of the people I spoke to, they seem to have a combination\nof a high IQ and a low EQ. They seem to take comfort\nin anonymous, online spaces rather than connecting in the real world. So often they would retreat\nto these message boards or these subreddits, where their worst impulses\nwould be magnified. They might start out saying\nsomething just as a sick joke, and then they would get so much\npositive reinforcement for that joke, so many meaningless\n\"internet points,\" as they called it, that they might start\nbelieving their own joke. I talked a lot with one young woman\nwho grew up in New Jersey, and then after high school,\nshe moved to a new place and suddenly she just felt\nalienated and cut off and started retreating into her phone. She found some of these\nspaces on the internet where people would post\nthe most shocking, heinous things. And she found this stuff\nreally off-putting but also kind of engrossing, kind of like she couldn't\nlook away from it. She started interacting with people\nin these online spaces, and they made her feel smart,\nthey made her feel validated. She started feeling a sense of community, started wondering if maybe\nsome of these shocking memes might actually contain a kernel of truth. A few months later, she was in a car\nwith some of her new internet friends headed to Charlottesville, Virginia, to march with torches\nin the name of the white race. She'd gone, in a few months,\nfrom Obama supporter to fully radicalized white supremacist. Now, in her particular case, she actually was able to find her way\nout of the cult of white supremacy. But a lot of the people\nI spoke to were not. And just to be clear: I was never so convinced\nthat I had to find common ground with every single person I spoke to that I was willing to say, \"You know what, man,\nyou're a fascist propagandist, I'm not, whatever, let's just hug it out,\nall our differences will melt away.\" No, absolutely not. But I did become convinced that we cannot\njust look away from this stuff. We have to try to understand it,\nbecause only by understanding it can we even start to inoculate\nourselves against it. In my three years in this world,\nI got a few nasty phone calls, even some threats, but it wasn't a fraction of what\nfemale journalists get on this beat. And yeah, I am Jewish, although, weirdly, a lot of the Nazis\ncouldn't tell I was Jewish, which I frankly just found\nkind of disappointing. (Laughter) Seriously, like, your whole job\nis being a professional anti-Semite. Nothing about me\nis tipping you off at all? Nothing? (Laughter) This is not a secret. My name is Andrew Marantz,\nI write for \"The New Yorker,\" my personality type\nis like if a Seinfeld episode was taped at the Park Slope Food Coop. Nothing? (Laughter) Anyway, look -- ultimately,\nit would be nice if there were, like, a simple formula: smartphone plus alienated kid\nequals 12 percent chance of Nazi. It's obviously not that simple. And in my writing, I'm much more comfortable\nbeing descriptive, not prescriptive. But this is TED, so let's get practical. I want to share a few suggestions of things that citizens\nof the internet like you and I might be able to do to make things\na little bit less toxic. So the first one is to be a smart skeptic. So, I think there are\ntwo kinds of skepticism. And I don't want to drown you in technical\nepistemological information here, but I call them smart and dumb skepticism. So, smart skepticism: thinking for yourself, questioning every claim, demanding evidence -- great, that's real skepticism. Dumb skepticism:\nit sounds like skepticism, but it's actually closer\nto knee-jerk contrarianism. Everyone says the earth is round, you say it's flat. Everyone says racism is bad, you say, \"I dunno,\nI'm skeptical about that.\" I cannot tell you how many young white men\nI have spoken to in the last few years who have said, \"You know, the media, my teachers,\nthey're all trying to indoctrinate me into believing in male privilege\nand white privilege, but I don't know about that,\nman, I don't think so.\" Guys -- contrarian\nwhite teens of the world -- look: if you are being a round earth skeptic\nand a male privilege skeptic and a racism is bad skeptic, you're not being a skeptic,\nyou're being a jerk. (Applause) It's great to be independent-minded,\nwe all should be independent-minded, but just be smart about it. So this next one is about free speech. You will hear smart, accomplished people\nwho will say, \"Well, I'm pro-free speech,\" and they say it in this way\nthat it's like they're settling a debate, when actually, that is the very beginning\nof any meaningful conversation. All the interesting stuff\nhappens after that point. OK, you're pro-free speech.\nWhat does that mean? Does it mean that David Duke\nand Richard Spencer need to have active Twitter accounts? Does it mean that anyone\ncan harass anyone else online for any reason? You know, I looked through\nthe entire list of TED speakers this year. I didn't find a single\nround earth skeptic. Is that a violation of free speech norms? Look, we're all pro-free speech,\nit's wonderful to be pro-free speech, but if that's all you know\nhow to say again and again, you're standing in the way\nof a more productive conversation. Making decency cool again, so ... Great! (Applause) Yeah. I don't even need to explain it. So in my research, I would go\nto Reddit or YouTube or Facebook, and I would search for \"sharia law\" or I would search for \"the Holocaust,\" and you might be able to guess\nwhat the algorithms showed me, right? \"Is sharia law sweeping\nacross the United States?\" \"Did the Holocaust really happen?\" Dumb skepticism. So we've ended up in this\nbizarre dynamic online, where some people see bigoted propaganda as being edgy or being dangerous and cool, and people see basic truth\nand human decency as pearl-clutching or virtue-signaling or just boring. And the social media algorithms,\nwhether intentionally or not, they have incentivized this, because bigoted propaganda\nis great for engagement. Everyone clicks on it,\neveryone comments on it, whether they love it or they hate it. So the number one thing\nthat has to happen here is social networks need\nto fix their platforms. (Applause) So if you're listening to my voice\nand you work at a social media company or you invest in one\nor, I don't know, own one, this tip is for you. If you have been optimizing\nfor maximum emotional engagement and maximum emotional engagement turns out\nto be actively harming the world, it's time to optimize for something else. (Applause) But in addition to putting pressure\non them to do that and waiting for them\nand hoping that they'll do that, there's some stuff that\nthe rest of us can do, too. So, we can create some better pathways\nor suggest some better pathways for angsty teens to go down. If you see something that you think\nis really creative and thoughtful and you want to share that thing,\nyou can share that thing, even if it's not flooding you\nwith high arousal emotion. Now that is a very small step, I realize, but in the aggregate,\nthis stuff does matter, because these algorithms,\nas powerful as they are, they are taking their\nbehavioral cues from us. So let me leave you with this. You know, a few years ago\nit was really fashionable to say that the internet\nwas a revolutionary tool that was going to bring us all together. It's now more fashionable to say that the internet is a huge,\nirredeemable dumpster fire. Neither caricature is really true. We know the internet\nis just too vast and complex to be all good or all bad. And the danger with\nthese ways of thinking, whether it's the utopian view\nthat the internet will inevitably save us or the dystopian view that it\nwill inevitably destroy us, either way, we're letting\nourselves off the hook. There is nothing inevitable\nabout our future. The internet is made of people. People make decisions\nat social media companies. People make hashtags trend or not trend. People make societies progress or regress. When we internalize that fact, we can stop waiting\nfor some inevitable future to arrive and actually get to work now. You know, we've all been taught\nthat the arc of the moral universe is long but that it bends toward justice. Maybe. Maybe it will. But that has always been an aspiration. It is not a guarantee. The arc doesn't bend itself. It's not bent inevitably\nby some mysterious force. The real truth, which is scarier and also more liberating, is that we bend it. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But it wasn’t money they were after. Less than one hour after spirits \nhad become illegal throughout the United States, the robbers made off with thousands \nof dollars worth of whiskey. It was a first taste of the unintended \nconsequences of Prohibition. The nationwide ban on the production \nand sale of alcohol in the United States came on the heels \nof a similar ban in Russia that started as a wartime measure \nduring World War I. But the view in the Western world \nof alcohol as a primary cause of social ills \nwas much older. It first gained traction \nduring the Industrial Revolution as new populations of workers \npoured into cities and men gathered in saloons to drink. By the 19th century, anti-drinking groups\ncalled temperance movements began to appear in the United States \nand parts of Europe. Temperance groups believed \nthat alcohol was the fundamental driver behind problems like poverty \nand domestic violence, and set out to convince \ngovernments of this. While some simply advocated \nmoderate drinking, many believed alcohol \nshould be banned entirely. These movements drew support \nfrom broad sectors of society. Women’s organizations were active \nparticipants from the beginning, arguing that alcohol made men neglect\ntheir families and abuse their wives. Religious authorities, \nespecially Protestants, denounced alcohol \nas leading to temptation and sin. Progressive labor activists \nbelieved alcohol consumption harmed workers’ ability to organize. Governments weren’t strangers \nto the idea of prohibition, either. In the United States and Canada, \nwhite settlers introduced hard liquors like rum to Native communities, then blamed alcohol for disrupting \nthese communities— though there were many other \ndestructive aspects of their interactions. The American and Canadian governments\nbanned the sale of alcohol to Native populations \nand on reservation land. American temperance movements gained\ntheir first victories at the state and local levels, with Maine and several other states \nbanning the sale and production of liquor in the 1850s. In 1919 the 18th Amendment \nto the US Constitution banned the manufacture, sale, \nand transportation of all alcoholic beverages. The amendment took effect a year later\nunder the Volstead Act. Since the act did not ban \npersonal consumption, wealthy people took the opportunity \nto stock up while restaurants and bars rushed to sell their remaining supply. Workers lost their jobs as distilleries, \nbreweries, and wineries closed down. Meanwhile, organized crime groups \nrushed to meet the demand for alcohol, establishing a lucrative black market \nin producing, smuggling, and selling illicit liquor. Often they worked side-by side \nwith corrupt policemen and government officials, even bombing the 1928 primary election\nfor Illinois state attorney in support of a particular \npolitical faction. Tens of thousands of illegal bars, \nknown as \"speakeasies,\" began serving alcohol. They ranged from dingy basement bars \nto elaborate dance-halls. People could also make alcohol \nat home for their own consumption, or obtain it legally with a doctor’s \nprescription or for religious purposes. To prevent industrial alcohol \nfrom being consumed, the government required manufacturers\nto add harmful chemicals, leading to thousands of poisoning deaths. We don’t know exactly how much people\nwere drinking during Prohibition because illegal alcohol \nwasn’t regulated or taxed. But by the late 1920s, it was clear that Prohibition \nhad not brought the social improvements it had promised. Instead it contributed to political \ncorruption and organized crime and was flouted by millions of citizens. At one raid on an Detroit beer hall, \nthe local sheriff, mayor and a congressman were arrested for drinking. With the start of the Great \nDepression in 1929, the government sorely needed the tax\nrevenue from alcohol sales, and believed that lifting Prohibition \nwould stimulate the economy. In 1933, Congress passed the 21st\nAmendment repealing the 18th— the only amendment to be fully repealed. Members of the temperance movements believed that alcohol \nwas the root of society’s problems, but the reality is more complicated. And while banning it completely \ndidn’t work, the health and social impacts \nof alcohol remain concerns today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which major country introduced Prohibition before the United States?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "France"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Russia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Australia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Germany"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which populations in the U.S. and Canada were banned from drinking alcohol in the 1800s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "German immigrants"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Women"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Native peoples"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ships’ captains"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What were illegal underground bars called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dives"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Saloons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cabarets"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Speakeasies"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "During Prohibition much of the illegal alcohol business was controlled by which?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The FBI"}, {"label": "B", "text": "State legislatures"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Organized crime"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Temperance organizations"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why did so many women support anti-alcohol policies?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Many men spent money on alcohol rather than their families"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Women didn’t drink"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alcohol was too expensive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They wanted men to stay home"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 9, "lesson": 20, "title": "Can you solve the Ragnarok riddle? - Dan Finkel", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-ragnarok-riddle-dan-finkel", "transcript": {"en": "Ragnarok. The fabled end of the world, when giants, monsters, and Norse gods \nbattle for the future. The gods were winning handily until \nthe great serpent Jörmungandr emerged. It swallowed Valhalla, \ncontorted itself across the land, and then merged into one continuous body \nwith no head and no tail. As it begins to digest Valhalla, an exhausted Odin explains that he has \njust enough power to strike the creature with one final bolt of lightning. If you magnify his blast \nwith your fabled hammer, Mjölnir, it should pierce the massive serpent. You’ll run with super-speed \nalong the serpent’s body. When you hold your hammer high, \nOdin will strike it with lightning and split Jörmungandr open at that point. Then, you’ll need to continue \nrunning along its body until every part of it is destroyed. You can’t run over the same section twice or you’ll fall into the already blasted \npart of the snake. But you can make multiple passes \nthrough points where the creature intersects its own body. If you leave any portion un-zapped, \nJörmungandr will magically regenerate, Odin’s last power will be spent, \nand Valhalla will fall forever. What path can you take to destroy \nthe serpent? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 2 1 One powerful way to solve problems \nis to simplify. And in this case, we can focus \nour attention on the two things that are important for our path: intersections and the stretches \nof snake between them. Or, as they’re referred \nto in graph theory, nodes and edges. The edges are important \nbecause they’re what we need to travel. And the nodes matter \nbecause they connect the edges, and are where we may need to make choices \nas we run from edge to edge. This simplification into nodes \nand edges leaves us with a ubiquitous and important \nmathematical object known as a graph, or network. We just need to figure out how to travel \nwhat mathematicians call an Eulerian path, which traces every edge exactly once. Instead of looking at the path as a whole,\nlet’s zoom in on a single node. During some moment in your run, \nyou’ll enter that node, and then exit it. That takes care of two edges. If you enter again, \nyou’ll need to exit again too, which requires another pair of edges. So every point along your path \nwill have edges that come in pairs. One edge in each pair will function \nas entrance; the other as exit. And that means that the number of edges \ncoming out of every node must be even. There are just two exceptions: \nthe start and end points, where you can exit \nwithout entering, or vice versa. If we look at the network \nformed by the serpent again, and number how many edges \nemerge from each node, a pattern jumps out that fits \nwhat we just saw. Every node has an even number \nof edges emerging from it, except two. So one of these must be the start \nof your route, and the other the end. Interestingly enough, any connected \nnetwork that has exactly 2 nodes with an odd number of edges \nwill also contain an Eulerian path. The same is true if there are no nodes \nwith an odd number of edges— in that case the path starts \nand ends in the same spot. So knowing that, \nlet’s return to our full graph. We can begin by taking care \nof this edge here. Now we can zig-zag back and forth \nacross the whole snake until we reach the end. And that's just one solution— \nit helps to be systematic, but you’re likely to happen \nupon many others once you know where to begin \nand end your run. You hold your hammer high \nat the opportune moment, and Odin sends the world-saving surge \nof lightning at you. Then you run \nlike you’ve never run before. If you can pull this off, surely nothing \ncould stop the might of the Norse Gods. And if something like that were out there,\nslouching its way towards you… well, that would be a story \nfor another day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the threat you face?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A giant boar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A giant piranha"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tiny microbes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A giant serpent"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How can you destroy the serpent?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Disguise yourself as its prey, and attack it from the inside"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cause the extinction of all reptiles through global warming"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Let it die of natural causes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Run the length of its body while channeling lightning, crossing every segment exactly once"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The abstract diagram representing the serpent’s body is called a", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Diode, or genome"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Graph, or network"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reptile, or amphibian"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Skyway, or interstate"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Graphs consist of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lines and slopes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Muscle and bone"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nodes and edges"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stars and stripes"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A path along a graph that covers every edge exactly once is a called", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eulerian"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Euclidean"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Elvish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Complete"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

At 15, he went through the rites \nof adulthood and received the daishô— a pair of swords. The long sword is for training \nand combat, while the short sword \nhas a sole, solemn purpose— to commit ritual suicide, or seppuku, if he dishonors himself, his family, \nor the daimyo. Banshirô idolizes the legendary samurai \nMiyamoto Musashi, a renowned swordsman \nwho lived 150 years earlier. But Banshirô doesn’t admire \nhis swordsmanship alone. Miyamoto Musashi was also \na master calligrapher and painter. That’s the real reason \nBanshirô wants to go to Edo— he secretly wants to be a painter, too. After finishing his practice at home, \nhe bids his father goodbye and walks to school. His father is preparing to accompany \nthe daimyo to the capital. The Tokugawa shogun, head of the Japanese \nmilitary government, requires all the regional rulers \nto alternate years between their castle town \nin the home domain and the capital city. The costly treks back and forth \nkeep the daimyo subordinate and prevent them from building up \ntheir own military forces to challenge the shogunate. The daimyo’s wife and children \nlive in the capital full time, where they serve as hostages \nto ensure his loyalty. But the practice \ndoesn’t just affect the daimyo— it determines much of the rhythm \nof life in Japan. Samurai must accompany the daimyo to Edo. This year it’s Banshirô’s father’s \nturn to go, and Banshirô is desperate to go with him; but given that he’s still in training, \nhe’ll need permission from both his father and the domain. At school, Banshirô’s first lesson \nis in swordfighting. Under his teacher’s stern eye, \nhe pairs up with his classmates and goes through the routines \nhe’s been practicing. At the end of the lesson, he reminds the \ninstructor of his request to go to Edo. The instructor cracks \nhis first smile of the day, and Banshirô feels confident \nhe will gain his support. Next, Banshirô practices archery, \nhorsemanship, and swimming before his academic courses \nin the afternoon. Courses cover Confucian philosophy, \nmorality, and history. When the instructor calls on him, he has \nthe response on the tip of his tongue, ensuring another supporter \nfor his campaign. By the end of the day, Banshirô \nfeels confident that his formal request will be approved, but the greatest \nchallenge is still ahead of him: convincing his father. His father believes the martial arts \nare more important than the literary arts, so Banshirô doesn’t mention \nhis artistic ambitions. Instead, he talks about renowned \nsword instructors he can train with, and teaching certifications he can earn \nto improve his professional prospects back in Kôchi. Then, he makes his final, \nstrongest argument: if he goes this time and succeeds, \nhis father can retire and send him instead in the future. It’s this last point \nthat finally sells him— Banshirô’s father agrees \nto take him on his tour of duty. In the bustle of the capital city, \nBanshirô will finally have the opportunity to pursue his secret ambition \nto become a painter."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The wives and children of daimyo had to live in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "remote villages"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kochi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Osaka"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Edo"}, {"label": "E", "text": "the castle town of the daimyo"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "At what age did Banshiro become an adult?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "15"}, {"label": "C", "text": "18"}, {"label": "D", "text": "21"}, {"label": "E", "text": "30"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In becoming an adult Banshiro:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "received a diploma"}, {"label": "B", "text": "had his arm tatooed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "received a gift of money"}, {"label": "D", "text": "was given a pair of swords"}, {"label": "E", "text": "could apply for a driver’s license"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Samurai could be all of these, except:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a scholar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "a teacher"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a master of tea ceremony"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a merchant"}, {"label": "E", "text": "an artist"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "During the Tokugawa period Japan was organized formally into:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "counties"}, {"label": "B", "text": "states"}, {"label": "C", "text": "prefectures"}, {"label": "D", "text": "domains"}, {"label": "E", "text": "municipalities"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

King", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/6lEbRXaS", "transcript": {"en": "I'd like to tell you today\nabout an orca named Tahlequah. Tahlequah is also known\nas J35 to scientists, because she swims with the J Pod\nin the Salish Sea. These are the waters off of\nBritish Columbia and Washington State. Now, last year, in July 2018, she was well along\nin her 17-month pregnancy, and scientists were very excited because no baby had survived\nin this pod for three long years. Now, orcas are also\nknown as killer whales. They're profoundly social\nand profoundly intelligent beings. And scientists are very interested\nin their behavior, because in their social networks,\nthey share habits, information and even affection. They create true cultures of the ocean. But this pod has been in trouble. The Chinook salmon that the orcas favor\nhas been way down in the region, and pollution has been up. But on July 24th, Tahlequah\ngave birth to a daughter, and scientists were so excited\nby this development. But unfortunately, the same day --\nin fact, shortly after birth -- the calf died. Well, what happened next\nelectrified animal lovers across the world, because Tahlequah refused\nto let her baby slip off into the water. She kept it on her body\nand she swam with it. If it did fall off,\nshe would dive and rescue it, and she battled stiff currents to do this. Now, she kept this behavior up for 17 days, and during this time,\nshe swam over 1,000 miles. At that point, she let the little baby\nslip off into the water. So today, Tahlequah\nswims on with the J Pod, but her grief still moves me. And I do believe that \"grief\"\nis the right word to use. I believe that grief\nis the right word to use for numerous animals who mourn the dead. They may be friends or mates or relatives. Because these visible cues,\nthese behavioral cues, tell us something about\nan animal's emotional state. Now, for the last seven years, I've been working to document\nexamples of animal grief -- in birds, in mammals, in domesticated animals\nand in wild animals -- and I believe in the reality\nof animal grief. Now, I say it this way because I need to acknowledge\nto you right up front that not all scientists agree with me. And part of the reason, I think, is because of what I call the \"a-word.\" The a-word is anthropomorphism, and historically,\nit's been a big deterrent to recognizing animal emotions. So, anthropomorphism is when\nwe project onto other animals our capacities or our emotions. And we can all probably\nthink of examples of this. Let's say we have a friend who tells us, \"My cat understands everything I say.\" Or, \"My dog, he's so sweet. he ran right across the yard this morning\ntowards a squirrel, and I know he just wants to play.\" Well, maybe. Or maybe not. I'm skeptical about claims like those. But animal grief is different, because we're not trying\nto read an animal's mind. We're looking at visible cues of behavior and trying to interpret them\nwith some meaning. Now, it's true -- scientists\noften push back at me, and they'll say, \"Ah, look, the animal might be stressed, or maybe the animal's just confused because his or her routine\nhas been disrupted.\" But I think that this overworry\nabout anthropomorphism misses a fundamental point. And that is that animals\ncan care very deeply for each other, maybe they even love each other. And when they do, a survivor's heart\ncan be pierced by a death. Let's face it: if we deny evolutionary continuity, we are really missing out\non embracing part of ourselves. So yes, I believe in the reality\nof animal grief, and I also think that if we recognize it, we can make the world\na better place for animals, a kinder place for animals. So let me tell you a little bit more\nabout animal grief. I'm going to start in Kenya. You see here there's\nan elephant named Eleanor who came one day with bruised legs, and she collapsed. You see on the left that another female named Grace\ncame to her right away and, using her own trunk, propped her up, tried to get her up on her feet. And she did succeed, but then Eleanor collapsed again. At this point, Grace became\nvisibly distressed, and she prodded the body,\nand she vocalized. Eleanor collapsed again, and unfortunately, she did die. What you see on the right is a female\nfrom another family named Maui, who came after the death,\nand she stayed at the body. She held a vigil there,\nand she even rocked in distress over the body. So the scientists watching the elephants kept close observation on Eleanor's body for seven days. And during those seven days, a parade of elephants came from five different families. Now, some were just curious, but others carried out behaviors that I really believe\nshould be classified as grief. So what does grief look like? It can be rocking, as I said, in distress. It can also be social withdrawal, when an animal just takes\nhimself or herself away from friends and stays by themselves, or a failure to eat or sleep properly, sometimes a depressed posture\nor vocalization. It can be very helpful\nfor those of us studying this to be able to compare the behavior\nof a survivor before death and after death, because that increases the rigor\nof our interpretation. And I can explain this to you by talking about two ducks\nnamed Harper and Kohl. So we're into birds now. So Harper and Kohl were raised\nat a foie gras factory, and they were treated cruelly. Foie gras does involve\nforce-feeding of birds. So this hurt their bodies, and their\nspirits were not in good shape, either. But thankfully, they were rescued\nby a farm sanctuary in upstate New York. And for four years, they stabilized,\nand they were fast friends. They often took themselves\nto a small pond on the property. Then, Kohl started to have\nreally intractable pain in his legs, and it was clear to the sanctuary\nthat he had to be euthanized humanely, and he was. But then the sanctuary workers\ndid a brilliant thing, because they brought Harper\nto the body to see. And at first, Harper prodded\nthe body of his friend, but then he laid himself over it, and he stayed there\nfor over an hour with his friend. And in the weeks after, he had a hard time. He would go back to that same pond\nwhere he had been with Kohl, and he didn't want any other friends. And within two months, he died as well. Now, I'm happy to say that not all grieving animals\nhave this sorrowful outcome. Last summer, I flew to Boston\nto visit my adult daughter, Sarah. I was with my husband Charlie. I really needed a break from work. But I succumbed,\nand I checked my work email. You know how that is. And there was a communication\nabout a dejected donkey. Now, as an anthropologist,\nthis wasn't what I expected, but there it was, and I'm glad I read it. Because a donkey named Lena\nhad gone to another farm sanctuary, this one in Alberta, Canada, as the only donkey there, and had trouble making friends\nfor that reason. But she eventually did make friends\nwith an older horse named Jake, and for three years they were inseparable. But the reason the email came\nwas that Jake, at age 32, the horse, had become gravely ill\nand had to be put down, and this is what was going on. This is Lena standing on Jake's grave. She didn't want to come in at night.\nShe didn't want to come in for food. She didn't want to come in for water. She pawed at the grave,\nshe brayed in distress, and there she stood. So we talked and we brainstormed. What do you do for an animal like this? And we talked about the role of time, of extra love and kindness from people and of urging her to make a new friend. And here's where her trajectory does\ndiverge from that of Harper the duck, because she did make a new friend, and sanctuary workers wrote back\nand said it worked out well. Now sometimes, scientists\nsupplement observation with hormonal analysis. There's an example of a group\nof scientists in Botswana, who took fecal material from baboons\nand compared two different groups. The first group were females\nwho had witnessed a predator attack and lost someone in that attack, and the second group were females\nwho had witnessed an attack but had not lost someone. And the stress hormones\nwere way up in that first group. But here's the thing: the scientists didn't just\ncall them \"stressed baboons,\" they called them \"bereaved baboons,\" and in part, that's because\nof the observations that they made. For example, this mother-daughter\npair were very close, and then the daughter\nwas killed by a lion. The mother removed herself\nfrom all her friends, from her grooming networks,\nand just stayed by herself for weeks -- bereavement -- and she then slowly recovered. So we have bereaved baboons. Will science tell us someday\nabout bereaved bees? Will we hear about frogs who mourn? I don't think so, and I think the reason\nis because animals really need one-to-one, close relationships\nfor that to happen. I also know that circumstance matters,\nand personality matters. I have documented\ncats and dogs who grieve, our companion animals, but I also interacted with a woman\nwho was extremely bothered because her dog wasn't grieving. She said to me, \"The first dog\nin the house has died. The second animal does not\nseem concerned, the second dog. What is wrong with him?\" (Laughter) And as I listened to her, I realized that this dog was now\nthe only animal in the household, and as far as he was concerned,\nthat was a pretty good deal. So circumstances matter. Now, in any case, animals\nare not going to grieve exactly like we do. We have human creativity. We paint our grief, dance our grief, write our grief. We also can grieve for people\nwe've never met, across space and time. I felt this strongly when I went to Berlin and I stood at the Holocaust Memorial. Animals don't grieve exactly like we do, but this doesn't mean\nthat their grief isn't real. It is real, and it's searing, and we can see it if we choose. Now, I've lost both my parents. I lost a very dear friend\nat a young age from AIDS. I believe most likely most of you\nhere have lost someone. And I have found it a genuine comfort, a solace, to know that we aren't\nthe only beings on this earth who feel love and grief. And I think this is important. I also think we can take\nthis a step further, and we can realize\nthat the reality of animal grief can help us be better\nand do better for animals. This is already happening with Tahlequah, because the United States and Canada have\nrenewed their talks with greater urgency for how to help the orcas, how to restore the Chinook salmon and how to help with the water pollution. We can also see that if grief is real, there's tremendous\nplausibility to the notion that animals feel a whole range of things. So we could look at joy,\nsadness, even hope. And if we do that, here's how we can start\nto think about the world. We can look at orcas and say, we know they grieve,\nwe know they feel their lives, and we can refuse to confine them\nto small tanks in theme parks and make them perform\nfor our entertainment. (Applause) Thank you. We can look at elephants\nand say, yes, they grieve, and we can renew our efforts\nagainst international trophy hunting and against poaching. (Applause) Thank you. And we can look at our closest\nliving relatives, monkeys and apes, and know yes they grieve,\nthey feel their lives, so they don't deserve to be confined in highly invasive biomedical experiments year after year. And, you know -- (Applause) the ducks Harper and Kohl,\nthey tell us something too. They help us connect the dots\nand realize that what we eat affects how animals live. And it's not just foie gras,\nand it's not just ducks. We can think about pigs and chickens\nand cows in factory farms, and we can know. I can tell you the science is real\nthat these animals feel, too. So every single time\nwe choose a plant-based meal, we are contributing\nto reducing animal suffering. (Applause) So yes, I believe in the reality\nof animal grief. I believe in the reality of animal love, and I think it is time for us humans to recognize that\nwe don't own these things. And when we see that, we have an opportunity to make the world\nso much better for animals, a kinder world, a gentler world, and along the way, we might\njust save ourselves, too. Thank you so much. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you.
