{"page": 34, "lesson": 2, "title": "The science of milk - Jonathan J. O'Sullivan", "category": "Nutrition", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-milk-jonathan-j-o-sullivan", "transcript": {"en": "Why do humans drink so much milk? And given that all mammals lactate, why do we favor certain types of milk\nover others? Milk is the first thing we drink, and thanks to developments in the\nproduction and variety of dairy products, it can take on countless forms\nfor our dietary and sensory well-being. Milk's primary function is as a complete\nsource of nutrition for newborns. In fact, since it has all of the vital\nnutrients for development and growth— proteins, carbohydrates, fats,\nvitamins and minerals, and water— milk is the only thing a baby\neven needs to ingest for the first six months of life. The unique makeup of milk can vary\ndepending on factors like species, diet, and location. Reindeer of the Arctic Circle,\nfor example, make energy-dense milk\nthat's about 20% fat, roughly five times more than human\nor cow's milk, to help their young survive\nthe harsh, freezing climate. So how is milk made? In the uniquely mammalian process\nof lactation, a special class of milk-secreting cells\nknown as mammocytes line up in a single layer\naround pear-shaped alveoli. Those cells absorb all of the building\nblocks of milk, then synthesize tiny droplets of fat on structures called\nsmooth endoplasmic reticula. The droplets combine with each other\nand other molecules and are then expelled and stored\nin spaces between cells. Mammary glands eventually secrete the milk\nthrough the breasts, udders, or, in the rare case of the platypus,\nthrough ducts in the abdomen. Although this process is typically\nreserved for females, in some species, like dayak fruit bats,\ngoats, and even cats, males can also lactate. Milk drinkers worldwide consume\ndairy from buffalo, goats, sheeps, camels, yaks, horses, and cows. Almost all of these species are ruminants, a type of mammal with\nfour-chambered stomachs that yield large quantities of milk. Of these, cows were the most\neasily domesticated and produce a milk that is both\neasily separated into cream and liquid and has a similar fat content\nto human milk. In their natural environment, mammals secrete milk on call\nfor immediate consumption by their young. But with the demands of thirsty consumers, the dairy industry has enlisted methods\nto step up production, enhance shelf life,\nand provide a variety of milk products. In the dairy, centrifugation machines\nspin milk at high speeds, forcing less dense fats to separate\nfrom the liquid and float up. After being skimmed off, this fat, known as butterfat,\ncan be used in dairy products like butter, cream, and cheese. Or it can be later added back\nto the liquid in varying proportions to yield different fat content milks. Full fat milk, sometimes referred\nto as whole milk, has 3.25% butterfat added compared to 1 to 2%\nfor low and reduced fat milk, and less than half a percent\nfor skim milk. To stop reseparation of the fat\nfrom the water, or creaming, the mixture undergoes the high-energy\npressurized process of homogenization. Before milk hits the shelves,\nit’s also typically heat treated to reduce its level of microbes— a government-sanctioned process that raw milk enthusiasts argue\nmay reduce milk's nutritional worth. Milk spoilage is started by microbes, which consume and break\ndown the nutrients in milk. That process causes butterfat\nto clump together, leading to a visually unpleasant product. And the byproducts of\nthe microbes' consumption are compounds that taste\nand smell nasty. But there's a bigger problem. Raw milk can carry microbes that are\nthe sources of deadly diseases, so in order to kill as many of those\nmicrobes as possible, and keep milk fresh longer, we use a technique called pasteurization. One version of this process involves\nexposing milk to about 30 seconds of high heat. Another version,\ncalled ultra-high temperature processing, or ultra pasteurization, blasts the milk with considerably higher\ntemperatures over just a few seconds. UHT milk boasts a much longer shelf life, up to twelve months unrefrigerated, compared to pasteurized milk's\ntwo weeks in the fridge. That's because the higher temperatures\nof UHT processing inactivate far more microbes. Yet the higher processing temperatures may adversely affect the nutritional\nand sensory properties of the milk. Ultimately, that choice lies\nin the consumer's taste and need for convenience. Fortunately, there are many\nchoices available in an industry that produces in excess\nof 840 million tons of products each year."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "____’s milk is the most widely drank milk throughout the world.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Buffalo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sheep"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cow"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Goat"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The main component of milk is water, where the other main components in milk are ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Proteins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sugars"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fats"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In dairy processing, one of the first stages is to separate butterfat from the water phase, achieved through a process known as ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Centrifugation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Evaporation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pasteurization"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Homogenization"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "To reduce the level of microbes in milk to a safe level, a process known as pasteurization is used.

That happens because these works\nemploy a technique called anamorphosis. Anamorphosis is a special case\nof perspective art, where artists represent realistic\nthree-dimensional views on two-dimensional surfaces. Though it's common today, this kind of perspective drawing has only\nbeen around since the Italian Renaissance. Ancient art often showed all figures\non the same plane, varying in size by symbolic importance. Classical Greek and Roman artists realized\nthey could make objects seem further by drawing them smaller, but many early attempts at perspective\nwere inconsistent or incorrect. In 15th century Florence, artists realized the illusion \nof perspective could be achieved with higher degrees\nof sophistication by applying mathematical principles. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci \nmanipulated the mathematics to create the first known \nanamorphic drawing. A number of other artists later\npicked up the technique, including Hans Holbein \nin \"The Ambassadors.\" This painting features a distorted\nshape that forms into a skull as the viewer approaches from the side. In order to understand how artists\nachieve that effect, we first have to understand how \nperspective drawings work in general. Imagine looking out a window. Light bounces off objects \nand into your eye, intersecting the window along the way. Now, imagine you could paint the image\nyou see directly onto the window while standing still and keeping\nonly one eye open. The result would be nearly\nindistinguishable from the actual view with your brain adding depth\nto the 2-D picture, but only from that one spot. Standing even just a bit off\nto the side would make the drawing \nlose its 3-D effect. Artists understand that \na perspective drawing is just a projection\nonto a 2-D plane. This allows them to use math to come up\nwith basic rules of perspective that allow them to draw without a window. One is that parallel lines, like these, can only be drawn as parallel if they're\nparallel to the plane of the canvas. Otherwise, they need to be drawn\nconverging to a common point known as the vanishing point. So that's a standard perspective drawing. With an anamorphic drawing,\nlike \"The Ambassadors,\" directly facing the canvas makes the image\nlook stretched and distorted, but put your eye in exactly the right spot\nway off to the side, and the skull materializes. Going back to the window analogy, it's as if the artist painted \nonto a window positioned at an angle instead of straight on, though that's not how Renaissance artists\nactually created anamorphic drawings. Typically, they draw a normal image \nonto one surface, then use a light, a grid, or even strings to project it\nonto a canvas at an angle. Now let's say you want to make\nan anamorphic sidewalk drawing. In this case, you want to create\nthe illusion that a 3-D image has been added\nseamlessly into an existing scene. You can first put a window\nin front of the sidewalk and draw what you want to add \nonto the window. It should be in the same perspective\nas the rest of the scene, which might require the use of those\nbasic rules of perspective. Once the drawing's complete, you can use a projector placed \nwhere your eye was to project your drawing down \nonto the sidewalk, then chalk over it. The sidewalk drawing \nand the drawing on the window will be nearly indistinguishable\nfrom that point of view, so viewers' brains will again be tricked into believing that the drawing\non the ground is three-dimensional. And you don't have to project onto\na flat surface to create this illusion. You can project onto multiple surfaces, or assemble a jumble of objects,\nthat from the right point of view, appears to be something else entirely. All over the planet, you can find\nsolid surfaces giving way to strange, wonderful,\nor terrifying visions. From your sidewalk \nto your computer screen, these are just some of the ways\nthat math and perspective can open up whole new worlds."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "To create a perspective drawing, we project:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 dimensions onto 3 dimensions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2 dimensions onto 1 dimension"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3 dimensions onto 2 dimensions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3 dimensions onto 3 dimensions"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Parallel lines leading away from the window will have projected images on the window that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bow outward from each other"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Converge to a common point"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Remain parallel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Squiggle"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many places are there to place our eye for a projected image on the window to exactly match up with the world outside of the window?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Infinitely many"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "An anamorphism distorts perspective using the same mathematical principles used to create perspective drawings.

With the growing interest in technologies and research, that could possibly bring animals and plants back from being, well, extinct. One of the candidates high on that list is the woolly mammoth. They're the closest relatives to our living Asian elephants today, and only widely disappeared about 10,000 years ago. With some isolated populations hanging on until about 4,700 years ago. That may seem like a long time, but at that period in the not-so-distant past, glass was being invented and the great pyramids of Giza were being built. So, really, it's a blip in the scheme of things. Since woolly mammoth's genetic information has been so well preserved in the permafrost, where recent specimens have been discovered, scientists have been able to sequence their genomes and now different groups are trying to figure out a way to insert mammoth genes into living elephant cells and maybe, in a way, bring them back. But my question is, why mammoths? Why not, say, mastodons? No, not the heavy metal group, the late miocene megafauna. Modern day elephants, mammoths and mastodons are all in the order proboscidea, along with other exinct tusked creatures, like palaeomastodons and gomphotheres. From the outside, mammoths and mastodons may look pretty similar, but they've been different for a very long time. About 25 million years. Mastodons were on Earth long before the mammoths, who showed up a little late to the Pleistocene party about 20 million years later. So you couldn't hope to have good luck splicing mastodon DNA into the Asian elephant genome. That's like putting human cells into a gibbon. It wouldn't work because the two are too genetically different. In addition to genetic differences between mammoths and mastodons, they're also morphologically different. This is most obviously seen in their teeth. Mammoths have large, flat, grinding surfaces on top of their molars, whereas mastodons have giant, mountain-like cusps. These cusps even inspired their scientific name, from the Greek word \"masto\" for \"breast\" and \"odon\" for \"tooth.\" Literally breast tooth. The shape of their teeth gives us clues about their diets, too. Mammoths were grazers, like cows and elephants today and as such, they have flat grinding surfaces on their teeth for breaking down grasses. Mastodons were browsers, like goats. The bulbous cusps on their teeth were useful for breaking down sticks and shrubs. So, remember, mammoths: cows. Matsodons: breast-toothed goats. In addition to differences in their dentition, mastodons were shorter stockier than mammoths with smaller ears, but there were some exceptions. Mammoths and mastodons are in two different genera, Mammut and Mammuthus. There were four different mastodon species and ten different species of mammoth. You're probably most familiar with the woolly mammoth but there was also a pygmy species, the dwarf mammoth, which was about as tall as I am. This species was found on the Channel Islands off of California and its small size was most likely result of island dwarfism. This can happen when a large species gets isolated on an island, since smaller animals require fewer food resources, and in the absence of predators, small animals tend to breed more quickly than their larger counterparts. As to how they got to the island, how else? They swam! Elephants today are great long-distance swimmers with their built-in snorkels and buoyant mass. Smelling delicious grasses from mainland California, a group of Columbian mammoths departed the coast, swimming out into the ocean towards the smell. Fast forward 30,000 years and congratulations! Almost puppy sized mammoths. While there isn't yet a conclusive answer as to what caused the extinction for both mammoths and mastodons in the last 10,000 years, whether it was from over-hunting by humans or climate related changes, a few questions remain. If we can resurrect the mammoth genome, should we? And where would we put them?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Woolly Mammoth went extinct 10,000 years ago.

A lot of people ask me,\nhow did I make these? A lot of times it's because\nthe person who asked the question wants to make an app also. A lot of kids these days\nlike to play games, but now they want to make them, and it's difficult, because not many kids know where to go to find out how to make a program. I mean, for soccer,\nyou could go to a soccer team. For violin, you could get lessons\nfor a violin. But what if you want to make an app? And the kid's parents might have done some of these things when they were young, but not many parents have written apps.\n(Laughter) Where do you go to find out\nhow to make an app? Well, this is how I approached it.\nThis is what I did. First of all, I've been programming in multiple other programming languages\nto get the basics down, such as Python, C, Java, etc. And then Apple released the iPhone, and with it, the iPhone\nsoftware development kit, and the software development kit\nis a suite of tools for creating and programming\nan iPhone app. This opened up a whole new world\nof possibilities for me, and after playing with\nthe software development kit a little bit, I made a couple apps,\nI made some test apps. One of them happened to be\nEarth Fortune, and I was ready to put Earth Fortune\non the App Store, and so I persuaded my parents\nto pay the 99 dollar fee to be able to put my apps\non the App Store. They agreed, and now I have\napps on the App Store. I've gotten a lot of interest\nand encouragement from my family, friends, teachers and even people at the Apple Store, and that's been a huge help to me. I've gotten a lot\nof inspiration from Steve Jobs, and I've started an app club at school, and a teacher at my school\nis kindly sponsoring my app club. Any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. This is so I can share\nmy experiences with others. There's these programs called\nthe iPad Pilot Program, and some districts have them. I'm fortunate enough to be part of one. A big challenge is,\nhow should the iPads be used, and what apps should we put on the iPads? So we're getting feedback\nfrom teachers at the school to see what kind of apps they'd like. When we design the app and we sell it, it will be free to local\ndistricts and other districts that we sell to,\nall the money from that will go into the local ed foundations. These days, students usually\nknow a little bit more than teachers with the technology.\n(Laughter) So - (Laughter) - sorry - (Laughter) - so this is a resource to teachers, and educators should recognize\nthis resource and make good use of it. I'd like to finish up by saying\nwhat I'd like to do in the future. First of all, I'd like to create\nmore apps, more games.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 7, "title": "The chemistry of skunk spray", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/2RYlemLH", "transcript": {"en": "Why do skunks smell so bad? It all comes down to chemistry. By the way, this video will include slow motion\nfootage of skunk anuses. So, be warned. I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. There are a number of species of skunk in\nthe world, but the most iconic has to be the striped skunk. That’s the one that looks like Pepe Le Pew—it’s\nall black, typically with one white line that usually splits into two on its back. And it can be found all over the United States\nas well as northern Mexico and southern Canada. Its latin name is Mephitis mephitis, which\nappropriately enough means something like foul stench or noxious vapor. Obviously, that’s because the most defining\ncharacter of skunks is their defensive spray, which can cause watery eyes, nausea, and leave\nyou smelling terrible. The chemical makeup of the spray is different\ndepending on the species, but all of them contain special types of compounds called\n“thiols.” Thiols, also known as “mercaptans,” are\na type of chemical group made up of a sulfur and hydrogen atom bonded together. And they typically smell really strongly. There are actually three different thiols\nin striped skunks spray, and two of those are the main contributors to the awful odor. But three other molecules in the spray are\nwhat are called “thioacetates.” Those compounds don’t have a strong scent,\nbut they can easily become thiols when they’re exposed to water. And that might explain why a pet that gets\nsprayed may start to smell skunky again after a bath. Now, skunk musk is produced by anal scent\nglands—which actually, lots of mammals have, though most aren’t quite this exciting. When a skunk sprays, nipple-like protrusions\ncalled papillae come out of the anus and squirt the musk at the target. The bad news is they can squirt a distance\nof about 10 feet, and are uncannily good at hitting their mark. The good news is that skunks really don’t\nwant to spray unless they have to, and adults usually give warning signals beforehand. Striped skunks will hiss, stomp, and raise\ntheir tails before spraying. And spotted skunks will even do a handstand. But, what should you do on the off-chance\nthat you wind up covered in musk? Well, definitely don’t use tomato juice—that’s\njust a myth. Instead, use something that converts the thiol\ninto a different type of compound. Some scientists suggest using a mixture of\ndilute hydrogen peroxide, baking soda, and a little liquid soap, which will oxidize the\nthiol and turn it into a sulfonic acid. But be careful, because it could dye your\nhair or pet fur. Anyway, despite their terrible reputation,\nsome skunks have actually been domesticated, and people say they make really cute and affectionate\npets. But if you do want a pet skunk, make sure\nyou know how to take care of it and get one from a breeder. Grabbing one from the woods is not at all\nnice for the skunk.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 8, "title": "3 Planets That Shouldn't Exist", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/QZvxdk4J", "transcript": {"en": "Pretty much as long as humans have looked\nup at the night sky, we’ve been studying astronomy. In all this time, we’ve learned so much\nabout the universe beyond our Solar System, and have found lots of exoplanets orbiting\nother stars. But there’s a lot that scientists still\ndon’t know. In fact, three relatively recent exoplanet\ndiscoveries are completely baffling researchers because, according to what we know about astronomy,\nthey shouldn’t exist! The first of these planets is called Kepler-78b, which was discovered using data from NASA’s\nKepler space telescope, and orbits a star about 400 light years away\nfrom Earth. Based on changes in its star’s light, astronomers\ncalculated that Kepler-78b’s radius is about 1.2 times the radius of Earth and it’s around 1.7 times as massive as\nthe Earth. This means it also has a similar density to\nthe Earth, so the researchers think its composition is\nsimilar, too, with lots of rock and iron. But that’s where the similarities stop. Kepler-78b is about 100 times closer to its\nstar than the Earth is to the Sun, and its surface temperatures might even get\nup to 3,100 Kelvin. Basically, it’s kind of like Earth … if\nEarth was a blazing inferno. This planet’s super close orbit to its host\nstar means that a year only lasts 8.5 hours. And scientists don’t understand how Kepler-78b\neven exists, because it doesn’t fit any of the current\ntheories of planetary formation it’s just too close to its star. See, when Kepler-78b was first forming from the gas and dust-filled protoplanetary\ndisk, its host star was even larger. So if the planet was orbiting where it is\nnow, it would’ve been inside its star, which\nis... impossible. Another option is that it formed farther away\nand migrated closer, but scientists think that’s pretty unlikely, since it probably would’ve kept going and\nplummeted into the star. As of now, it’s a mystery. The main thing we do know about Kepler-78b is that it’ll probably only be around for\nanother three billion years or so. It’ll move closer and closer to its host\nstar, until the gravity eventually tears it apart. Our next mysterious planet is called Kepler-10c, which was also detected using data from the\nKepler space telescope, and is about 560 light years away from us. It’s radius isn’t all that special. It’s only about 2.3 times the radius of\nthe Earth. And initially, because of its size, scientists predicted that Kepler-10c would\nhave a thick, gaseous atmosphere, making it like a mini-Neptune. Instead, they found a planet with a mass that\nmight be between 14-17 times the Earth’s, which suggests that it’s a really dense\nrocky planet without much of an atmosphere. A mass that large is basically unheard of\nin a planet that size, which is why astronomers dubbed it a mega-Earth. Which, y’know, sounds pretty cool. Based on our current understanding of planets, one this massive without an atmosphere shouldn’t\neven exist. Theoretically, it would’ve grabbed a bunch\nof nearby lighter elements with its huge gravitational force as the star\nsystem was forming, and turned into a gas giant like Jupiter. But it probably never even had an atmosphere, because if it did at some point, it would’ve\nheld onto it. So, right now, scientists are just left with\nanother giant rock in space that they can’t really explain. Last but not least, we have a gas giant named\nHD 106906 b, which is 11 times as massive as Jupiter, and discovered using data from the Hubble\nSpace Telescope and the Magellan telescope in Chile. This planet orbits a really young star 300\nlight years away from Earth. The system is only 13 million years old. But that’s not what makes it weird. See, HD 106906 b orbits its star at a distance\nof 650 astronomical units. That’s more than 20 times the average distance\nbetween the Sun and Neptune. A planet that far away from its host star shouldn’t have had enough gaseous and rocky\nmaterials to grow that huge, especially in such a relatively short period\nof time. But, somehow, it exists. Some researchers think it might have formed inside the dust-filled debris disk surrounding\nits host star, and got kicked out later, but they’re still\nnot sure. A recent study seems to support this idea, suggesting that the planet might have even\ncaptured some of that dusty material, and might be surrounded by a ring or shroud. But that’s just one hypothesis and, until\nastronomers get more data, the planet is still an enigma. These three planets are just a drop in the\nbucket that is our universe, and we still have so much to learn. It’s really the strangest discoveries that\nmake astronomy so cool. Every time we start to think we understand\nhow certain things work, like planetary formation, amazing surprises\nget thrown our way.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 9, "title": "Do schools kill creativity? - Sir Ken Robinson", "category": "Teaching & Education", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/xrDUKmjA", "transcript": {"en": "Good morning. How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes\nrunning through the conference, which are relevant\nto what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary\nevidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it\nand the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea\nwhat's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is,\neverybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party,\nand you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often\nat dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education,\nyou're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously.\nThat's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, \"What do you do?\" and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, \"Oh my God. Why me?\" (Laughter) \"My one night out all week.\" (Laughter) But if you ask about their education,\nthey pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things\nthat goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education,\nand I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education\nthat's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year\nwill be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been\non parade for the past four days, what the world will look like\nin five years' time. And yet, we're meant\nto be educating them for it. So the unpredictability,\nI think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this\nis that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary\ncapacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night\nwas a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think\nshe's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person\nof extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is,\nall kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now\nis as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it\nwith the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way.\nThank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) \"Well, I was born ... \" (Laughter) I heard a great story recently --\nI love telling it -- of a little girl\nwho was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was\nat the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl\nhardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her,\nand she said, \"What are you drawing?\" And the girl said,\n\"I'm drawing a picture of God.\" And the teacher said, \"But nobody\nknows what God looks like.\" And the girl said,\n\"They will in a minute.\" (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four\neverywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it,\nwherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play.\nDo you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel,\nyou may have seen it. (Laughter) \"Nativity II.\" But James got the part of Joseph,\nwhich we were thrilled about. We considered this to be\none of the lead parts. We had the place crammed\nfull of agents in T-shirts: \"James Robinson IS Joseph!\" (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know\nthe bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts,\ngold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think\nthey just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy\nafterward and said, \"You OK with that?\" They said,\n\"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?\" They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds\nwith tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first\nboy said, \"I bring you gold.\" And the second boy said,\n\"I bring you myrrh.\" And the third boy said, \"Frank sent this.\" (Laughter) What these things have in common\nis that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not\nfrightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong\nis the same thing as being creative. What we do know is,\nif you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up\nwith anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults,\nmost kids have lost that capacity. They have become\nfrightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running\nnational education systems where mistakes are the worst\nthing you can make. And the result is that\nwe are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said\nthat all children are born artists. The problem is to remain\nan artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately,\nthat we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon\nuntil about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford\nto Los Angeles. So you can imagine\nwhat a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place\ncalled Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where\nShakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare\nhaving a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think\nof Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's\nEnglish class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) \"Must try harder.\" (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad,\nto Shakespeare, \"Go to bed, now!\" To William Shakespeare. \"And put the pencil down!\" (Laughter) \"And stop speaking like that.\" (Laughter) \"It's confusing everybody.\" (Laughter) Anyway, we moved\nfrom Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word\nabout the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids;\nhe's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had\na girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had\ntheir fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, \"I'll never find\nanother girl like Sarah.\" And we were rather pleased\nabout that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason\nwe were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes you\nwhen you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth\nhas the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be\notherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages,\nthen the humanities. At the bottom are the arts.\nEverywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too,\nthere's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given\na higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education\nsystem on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important,\nbut so is dance. Children dance all the time\nif they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we?\nDid I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is,\nas children grow up, we start to educate them progressively\nfrom the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say \"What's it for, public education?\" I think you'd have to conclude,\nif you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points,\nwho are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude\nthe whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark\nof all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious\nabout professors. In my experience -- not all of them,\nbut typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there\nand slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know,\nin a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form\nof transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting\ntheir head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence\nof out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential\nconference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque\non the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women\nwrithing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can\ngo home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Our education system is predicated\non the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were\nno public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being\nto meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful\nsubjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away\nfrom things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never\nget a job doing that. Is that right? \"Don't do music, you're not\ngoing to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.\" Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world\nis engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate\nour view of intelligence, because the universities design\nthe system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education\naround the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is\nthat many highly talented, brilliant, creative people\nthink they're not, because the thing\nthey were good at at school wasn't valued,\nor was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford\nto go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be\ngraduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination\nof all the things we've talked about: technology and its\ntransformational effect on work, and demography and the huge\nexplosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student,\nif you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job,\nit's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees\nare often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA\nwhere the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure\nof education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink\nour view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways\nthat we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound,\nwe think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms,\nwe think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions\nof a human brain, as we heard yesterday\nfrom a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having\noriginal ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different\ndisciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves\nthat joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women\nare better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research,\nbut I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal\nat home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking,\nshe's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids,\nshe's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door\nis shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, \"Terry, please,\nI'm trying to fry an egg in here.\" (Laughter) \"Give me a break.\" (Laughter) Actually, do you know\nthat old philosophical thing, \"If a tree falls in a forest,\nand nobody hears it, did it happen?\" Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt\nrecently, which said, \"If a man speaks his mind in a forest,\nand no woman hears him, is he still wrong?\" (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment\ncalled \"Epiphany,\" which is based on a series\nof interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by\nhow people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation\nI had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people\nhave never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer,\nand everybody knows her work. She did \"Cats\" and \"Phantom of the Opera.\" She's wonderful. I used to be on the board\nof The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day.\nI said, \"How did you get to be a dancer?\" It was interesting. When she was at school,\nshe was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s,\nwrote to her parents and said, \"We think Gillian\nhas a learning disorder.\" She couldn't concentrate;\nshe was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD\nhadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room,\nand she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat\non this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems\nGillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people,\nher homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went\nand sat next to Gillian and said, \"I've listened to all these\nthings your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back.\nWe won't be very long,\" and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio\nthat was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother,\n\"Just stand and watch her.\" And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes,\nand he turned to her mother and said, \"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.\" I said, \"What happened?\" She said, \"She did. I can't tell you\nhow wonderful it was. We walked in this room,\nand it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.\" Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;\nthey did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned\nfor the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had\na wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated\nfrom the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful\nmusical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her\non medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution\nthat was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception\nof human ecology, one in which we start\nto reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth\nfor a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink\nthe fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote\nby Jonas Salk, who said, \"If all the insects\nwere to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years,\nall life on Earth would end. If all human beings\ndisappeared from the Earth, within 50 years,\nall forms of life would flourish.\" And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift\nof the human imagination. We have to be careful now\nthat we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios\nthat we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it\nis by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children\nfor the hope that they are. And our task is to educate\ntheir whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them\nmake something of it. Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

They're known as America's inland seas. The North American Great Lakes Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior are so massive\nthat they border eight states and contain 23 quadrillion\nliters of water. That's enough to cover the land area\nof the contiguous United States three meters deep. These vast bodies of water span forest, grassland, and wetland habitats, supporting a region that's home to over\n3,500 species. But how did such a vast and unique\ngeological feature come to be? The story begins near the end\nof the last ice age over 10,000 years ago, a time when the climate was warming and the glaciers that cloaked the Earth's\nsurface began their slow retreat. These immense ice sheets carved out\na series of basins. Those basins filled with water\nas the ice began to melt, creating the world's largest area\nof freshwater lakes. Over time, channels developed between\nthese basins, and water began to flow in\nan ongoing exchange that persists to this day. In fact, today,\nthe interconnected Great Lakes contain almost 20% of the world's supply\nof fresh surface water. The water's journey begins in\nthe far north of Lake Superior, which is the deepest, coldest,\nand clearest of the lakes, containing half the system's water. Lake Superior sinks to depths\nof 406 meters, creating a unique and diverse ecosystem\nthat includes more that 80 fish species. A given drop of water spends on average\n200 years in this lake before flowing into Lake Michigan\nor Lake Huron. Linked by the Straits of Mackinac,\nthese two lakes are technically one. To the west lies Lake Michigan, the third largest of the lakes\nby surface area. Water slowly moves through\nits cul-de-sac shape and encounters the world's largest\nfreshwater dunes, many wildlife species, and unique fossilized coral. To the east is Lake Huron,\nwhich has the longest shoreline. It's sparsely populated,\nbut heavily forested, including 7,000-year-old petrified trees. Below them, water continues to flow\nsoutheastwards from Lake Huron into Lake Erie. This lake's status as the warmest\nand shallowest of the five has ensured an abundance of animal life,\nincluding millions of migrating birds. Finally, the water reaches its last stop\nby dramatically plunging more than 50 meters down\nthe thundering Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario, the smallest lake\nby surface area. From there, some of this well-traveled\nwater enters the St. Lawrence River, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to being a natural wonder, the perpetually flowing Great Lakes\nbring us multiple benefits. They provide natural water filtration, flood control, and nutrients cycling. By moving water across\nmore than 3,200 kilometers, the Great Lakes also provide drinking\nwater for upward of 40 million people and 212 billion liters a day\nfor the industries and farms that line their banks. But our dependence on the system is\nhaving a range of negative impacts, too. The Great Lakes coastal habitats are being\ndegraded and increasingly populated, exposing the once pristine waters to industrial, urban,\nand agricultural pollutants. Because less than 1% of the water\nleaves the Lake's system annually, decades-old pollutants still lurk\nin its waters. Humans have also inadvertently introduced more than 100 non-native\nand invasive species into the lakes, such as zebra and quagga mussels,\nand sea lampreys that have decimated some indigenous\nfish populations. On a larger scale, climate change\nis causing the waters to warm, thus reducing water levels and changing\nthe distribution of aquatic life.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 11, "title": "8 Intelligences: Are You a Jack of All Trades or a Master of One?", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/ovmAclG8", "transcript": {"en": "Currently I think there are eight intelligences\nthat I’m very confident about and a few more that I’ve bene thinking about. I’ll share that with our audience. The first two intelligences are the ones which\nIQ tests and other kind of standardized tests valorize and as long as we know there are\nonly two out of eight it’s perfectly fine to look at them. Linguistic intelligence is how well you’re\nable to use language. It’s a kind of skill that poets have, other\nkinds of writers, journalists tend to have linguistic intelligence, orators. The second intelligence is logical mathematical\nintelligence. As the name implies logicians, mathematicians,\nscientists have that kind of intelligence. They’re able to do mathematical proofs. They’re able to do scientific reasoning\nand experimentation. And it’s great to have language and logical\nintelligence because most tests really focus on that. And if you do well in those tests as long\nas you stay in school you think you’re smart. But if you ever walk out into Broadway or\nthe highway or into the woods or into a farm you then find out that other intelligences\nare at least this important. So the third intelligence is musical intelligence\nand that’s the capacity to appreciate different kinds of musics, to produce the music by voice\nor by an instrument or to conduct music. And people say well music is a talent. It’s not an intelligence. And I say well why if you’re good with words\nis that an intelligence but if you’re good with tones and rhythms and timbres nobody’s\never given me a good answer which is why it makes sense to talk about musical intelligence. And at certain cultures over history musical\nintelligence has been very important. The fourth intelligence is spatial intelligence. That’s the intelligence which allows us\nto handle and work in space that’s close by. A chess player would have spatial intelligence. A surgeon would have spatial intelligence. But there’s another variety of spatial intelligence\nwhich we use for a much broader navigation. That’s what an airplane pilot or a sea captain\nwould have. How do you find your way around large territory\nand large space. Similarly with the fifth intelligence bodily\nkinesthetic intelligence it comes in two flavors. One flavor is the ability to use your whole\nbody to solve problems or to make things. And athletes and dancers would have that kind\nof bodily kinesthetic intelligence. But another variety is being able to use your\nhands or other parts of your body to solve problems or make things. A craft person would have bodily kinesthetic\nintelligence even if they weren’t particularly a good athlete or dancer. The sixth intelligence and seventh intelligence\nhave to do with human beings. Interpersonal intelligence is how you understand\nother people, how you motivate them, how you lead them, how you work with them, how you\ncooperate with them. Anybody at any workplace with other people\nneeds interpersonal intelligence. Leaders hopefully have a lot of interpersonal\nintelligence. But any intelligence can be used in a pernicious\nway so the salesman that sells you something you don’t want for a price you don’t want\nto pay, he or she has got interpersonal intelligence. It’s just not being used in a way that we\nmight prefer. The seventh kind of intelligence is difficult\nto assess but it’s very important. It’s intrapersonal intelligence. It’s the understanding yourself. If we go back a way in history and prehistory\nknowledge of yourself probably wasn’t that important because people did what their parents\nor grandparents did whether they were hunters or fisherman or craftspeople. But nowadays especially in developed society\npeople lead their own lives. We follow our own careers. We often switch careers. We don’t necessarily live at home as we\nget older. And if you don’t have a good understanding\nof yourself you are in big trouble. So that’s intrapersonal intelligence. The eighth intelligence which I added some\nyears ago is the naturalist intelligence. And that’s the capacity to make important\nrelevant discriminations in the world of nature between one plant and another, between one\nanimal and another. It’s the intelligence of the naturalist,\nthe intelligence of Charles Darwin. I missed it the first go around when I wrote\nabout it but I tried to atone by adding it to my list. And by the way you might say well but nature\nisn’t so important anymore. But in fact everything we do in the commercial\nworld uses our naturalist intelligence. Why do I buy this jacket rather than another\none? This sweater rather than another one? One hair style rather than another? Those all make just the naturalist intelligence\nbecause the brain is very adaptive. And when an old use of a brain center no longer\nis relevant it gets hijacked for something new. So we’re all using our naturalist intelligence\neven if we never walk out into the woods or into the savannah of East Asia. The two other intelligences which I’m interested\nin, one of them is called the teaching or pedagogical intelligence. The intelligence which allows us to be able\nto teach successfully to other people. Now you could have two people who have exactly\nthe same expertise and knowledge in the field but one is a very good teacher and the other\nisn’t. That probably doesn’t surprise individuals\nso much. But what got me fascinated was as young as\ntwo or three kids already know how to teach. Now what does that mean? You show a child how to do something let’s\nsay a three or four year old and then you ask the child to explain it to an older person\nor to a younger person. And even the three or four year old will explain\nit very differently to a young person, will go through details, point things and speak\nslowly. And with an older person it would be much\nmore elliptical and say well you do this and that and then you can figure it out. So that shows as young as three let’s say\nwe already have teaching intelligence. The other one is one which I think is going\nto be difficult to prove to a skeptic but I call it existential intelligence. And existential intelligence is the intelligence\nof big questions. Philosophical questions, artistic questions. What does it mean to love? Why do we die? What’s going to be in the future? My pet bird might have more musical intelligence. The rats who are scurrying around the floor\nmight have more spatial intelligence. But no other animals have existential intelligence. Part of the human condition is to think about\nquestions of existence. And I like to say every five year old has\nexistential intelligence because five year old are always asking why this, why that. But the difference between a five year old\nand a philosopher is the five year old doesn’t pay too much attention to the answer whereas\nphilosophers and other people who develop existential intelligence are really very interested\nin how we attack questions like that. So again where there’s eight intelligences\nor ten or twelve is less important to me than having broken the monopoly of a single intelligence\nwhich sort of labels you for all time. I think if we lived forever we could probably\ndevelop each intelligence to a very high degree. But life is very short and if you devote too\nmuch attention to one intelligence you’re not going to have much time to work on other\nkinds of intelligences. And so the big question is should you play\nto strength or should you bolster weakness? And that’s a value judgment. Scientists cannot give you an answer to that. If, for example, you want to be a jack of\nall trades and be very well rounded then probably you’re going to want to nurture the intelligences\nwhich aren’t that strong. If on the other hand you’re dead set on\nreally coming to the top of some particular heap then you’re probably going to find\nthe intelligences that you’re strongest at and really push those. And, you know, if a parent came to me and\nsaid well should we supplement or should we accentuate I would say well tell me what you\nwould like your child to do. Or better let the child tell you what he or\nshe wants to do rather than say well science says you should do one or the other. I think it’s a question of values, not of\nscience. Some people think there’s such a thing as\nhumor intelligence. But, in fact, I don’t. I think humor intelligence is simply the operation\nof a logical intelligence in some realm like human nature or physical nature or the workplace. And what happens is in humor there’s a certain\nexpectation and you flip that expectation so it’s logic but it’s logic that’s\nplayed out in different kinds of ways. People had mentioned there’s such a thing\nas a cooking intelligence, a humor intelligence and a sexual intelligence. And I quipped well that can’t be intelligences\nbecause I don’t have any of them."}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 34, "lesson": 12, "title": "How to master your sense of smell - Alexandra Horowitz", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-master-your-sense-of-smell-alexandra-horowitz", "transcript": {"en": "Perfumers can learn to distinguish\nindividual odors in a fragrance made of hundreds of scents. Tea experts have been known to sniff out not just the location \nwhere a tea was from, but the season of harvest\nand whether it was planted by a plum tree. And the New York City Transit Authority once had an employee responsible\nonly for sniffing out gas leaks in the subway system. Can just anyone learn to smell\nwith the sensitivity of those experts? For most of us, what we smell\nis largely involuntary, whether it's garbage behind a restaurant, the shampoo of the woman leaving\nan elevator as you enter, or a bakery's fresh-made bread. With a few million olfactory receptors\nin our noses, we clearly don't lack the ability\nto smell well. We just might not always pay close\nenough attention. That's a shame because we may be\nmissing opportunities to make strong emotional connections. Smells are powerfully linked to emotions and can awaken memories of places\nwe've long ago left and people we've loved. But fortunately, it is possible\nto train our brains to smell better. For example, Helen Keller was able\nto recognize a person's work, and in her words, distinguish the carpenter\nfrom the iron worker, the artist from the mason or the chemist, by a simple inhale. Follow these steps and you too can\nchange the way the world smells to you. First, stick your nose in it. Some animals that are known\nto be great smellers, like dogs who can sniff out explosives and pigs who can \nfind truffles underground, put their noses right at the place\nthey want to smell. Human noses, meanwhile, are casting\naround in the middle of the air, giving us an anatomical disadvantage. So bring your nose close to the world\naround you. The ground, surfaces, objects, the food in your hand. Get close to your dog, your partner, the book you're reading. Not only will your nose be closer\nto the odor source, but the warmth of your breath\nwill make odors easier to smell. Second, sniff like you mean it. Smelling actually happens way up near\nthe bridge of our noses in a postage stamp-sized square\nof tissue called the olfactory epithelium. When we sniff, odor molecules are sucked\nup into our nostrils until they hit this tissue where they combine to our olfactory,\nor scent, receptors. When we inhale normally,\nonly a little air makes it there. But one or two solid sharp sniffs will ensure that more air gets to\nyour smell receptors. After just a few more sniffs, the receptors, which are best at\nnoticing new smells, turn off temporarily. So you can give your nose a rest\nand sniff again later. Finally, dwell on the smell. Most smells pass by us \nwith little attention, but simply noticing what you're smelling and by trying to describe it, name it,\nand locate its source, you can expand your vocabulary of smells. When an odor molecule binds\nto a scent receptor, it sends an electrical signal\nfrom the sensory neurons to our brain's olfactory bulbs. The signal then continues to other\nareas of the brain, where it's integrated with taste, memory, or emotional information before registering to us as a smell. FMRI research shows that the extra\ntime spent focusing on scent changes the brain of experienced smellers. For them, perceiving and imagining odors\nbecomes more automatic than for non-experts. To get started yourself, take ingredients\nfrom your kitchen: spices, vanilla, or fruit, but never anything toxic. Close your eyes and have someone\nbring them under your nose. Sniff and try to name the source. Over time, you'll begin to appreciate\nnuances in familiar odors and recognize characteristics of new\nand unusual smells. The perfumer has practiced these steps\nenough to become an artist of odor, but even if you never pursue smelling\nto that degree, the spectacular result \nof an unspectacular action will change how you sense \nand experience your days."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "For most people, what we tend to smell is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Voluntary"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Involuntary"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An odor from someone we know"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An odor that we only smelled previously"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "From the context of the lesson, define what is meant by “olfactory” receptors.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Odors detected in factory settings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Relating to the sense of sight"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Relating to the sense of smell"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ability to interpret smell without sight"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "You really want to smell something.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 13, "title": "How cars went from boxy to curvy", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/xyjllDj6", "transcript": {"en": "If you look at cars from the 1970s and cars\nfrom the 1990s, there’s really one big difference in their designs. The ones from the 70s are boxy, and the ones\nfrom the 90s are curvy. For some car models, you can even tell the\nexact year when that change happened. Just look at this commercial for the Buick\nLeSabre, showing the 1991 model — and then the 1992 model. See the curves? Let’s watch that again. ‘91 is boxy, sharp edges. ‘92? Smooth and round. Since then, cars have become curvier and curvier. So how did this happen? When manufacturers started making curvy cars\nin the 90s, it wasn’t a totally new concept. Back in the 1930s, streamliners like this Chrysler\nAirflow used this sleek design to reduce wind resistance. But as the 50s and 60s rolled around, American\nstreamliners stopped selling well — they were outsold by bigger, boxier cars. Gas prices were on fairly steady decline at\nthis point, so streamlining for fuel efficiency was less of a concern. Well into the 1970s, just about every car\nmade in America had sharp edges and very few curves. They were basically designed as a series of\nthree boxes — the hood, the cabin, and the trunk. That model worked really well in the US market. But in Europe, fuel was always more expensive. In the 60s, a gallon of gas in France cost\na whopping 73.1 cents while it was just 31 cents in the US. So European designers started experimenting\nwith more aerodynamic designs to help cars move more easily so they’d waste less gas. Automakers like Porsche, BMW, Audi, Mercedes-Benz\n— they all started rolling out car models that had curved exteriors. Eventually American automakers started to\ncopy the European aerodynamic look to try to attract upscale consumers. The mass market was a different picture. In Europe, a designer named Uwe Bahnsen was\nthe first person to push for a curved design for the average driver, and he did that with\nthe 1982 Ford Sierra. It was curvier than any car in its class at\nthe time. But critics just laughed at it. And it didn't sell very well at first. It was nicknamed the “jelly mould” because\nof how much it looked like the kind of circular shape you’d make JELL-O with. But one of the designers from that European\nFord design team — this guy, Jack Telnack — took over the US design team in 1980. American gas prices at this point were skyrocketing\ndue to conflict in the middle east. So Telnack brought wind tunnel testing into\nthe design process. He first did that with the 1983 Ford Thunderbird. But the real breakthrough came a few years\nlater: \"The result was the groundbreaking 1986 Ford\nTaurus.\" It might not look that groundbreaking now,\nbut this style was revolutionary at the time. It was a mass market car with curvy edges\n— and people liked it. “Taurus! Now a North American car with a shape and\na feel we’ve never seen before… Taurus for us!” They used it in RoboCop as the car of the\nfuture. The sales basically saved Ford, which had\nreally been struggling at the time, and it inspired a whole wave of copycat curvy cars. And streamlining became even more popular\nbecause manufacturers were facing new fuel economy regulations in the US. Starting in 1978, the average fuel efficiency\nof each manufacturer’s passenger cars had to meet higher and higher levels. According to one Ford designer, aerodynamic\ndesign was a much more affordable way to boost efficiency than doing engineering work under\nthe hood. The rise of computer modelling in the 80s\nalso made it easier for car makers to design and manufacture curved lines. All these years later, the influence on today’s\ncars is pretty clear. Even the models that we criticize for being\nridiculously boxy these days — like the Scion xB — are actually really round. And if our modern day sci fi movies have anything\nto say about it, that won’t be changing anytime soon."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "According to this video, what was the main reason cars went from being 'curvy' to 'boxy' in the early 1960s?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "curvy cars were considered 'un-American'"}, {"label": "B", "text": "America was in a race to land on the moon, and boxy cars were considered futuristic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fuel prices were dropping"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "During this boxy car period, certain curvy cars were manufactured in America, but they were marketed towards upscale clients.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 14, "title": "What I learned from 100 days of rejection - Jia Jiang", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/VdQTGGdx", "transcript": {"en": "When I was six years old, I received my gifts. My first grade teacher\nhad this brilliant idea. She wanted us to experience\nreceiving gifts but also learning the virtue\nof complimenting each other. So she had all of us\ncome to the front of the classroom, and she bought all of us gifts\nand stacked them in the corner. And she said, \"Why don't we just stand here\nand compliment each other? If you hear your name called, go and pick up your gift and sit down.\" What a wonderful idea, right? What could go wrong? (Laughter) Well, there were 40 of us to start with, and every time I heard\nsomeone's name called, I would give out the heartiest cheer. And then there were 20 people left, and 10 people left, and five left ... and three left. And I was one of them. And the compliments stopped. Well, at that moment, I was crying. And the teacher was freaking out. She was like, \"Hey, would anyone\nsay anything nice about these people?\" (Laughter) \"No one? OK, why don't you\ngo get your gift and sit down. So behave next year -- someone might say\nsomething nice about you.\" (Laughter) Well, as I'm describing this you, you probably know\nI remember this really well. (Laughter) But I don't know who felt worse that day. Was it me or the teacher? She must have realized\nthat she turned a team-building event into a public roast\nfor three six-year-olds. And without the humor. You know, when you see\npeople get roasted on TV, it was funny. There was nothing funny about that day. So that was one version of me, and I would die to avoid\nbeing in that situation again -- to get rejected in public again. That's one version. Then fast-forward eight years. Bill Gates came to my hometown -- Beijing, China -- to speak, and I saw his message. I fell in love with that guy. I thought, wow,\nI know what I want to do now. That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them: \"By age 25, I will build the biggest\ncompany in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft.\" (Laughter) I totally embraced this idea\nof conquering the world -- domination, right? And I didn't make this up,\nI did write that letter. And here it is -- (Laughter) You don't have to read this through -- (Laughter) This is also bad handwriting,\nbut I did highlight some key words. You get the idea. (Laughter) So ... that was another version of me: one who will conquer the world. Well, then two years later, I was presented with the opportunity\nto come to the United States. I jumped on it, because that was\nwhere Bill Gates lived, right? (Laughter) I thought that was the start\nof my entrepreneur journey. Then, fast-forward another 14 years. I was 30. Nope, I didn't build that company. I didn't even start. I was actually a marketing manager\nfor a Fortune 500 company. And I felt I was stuck; I was stagnant. Why is that? Where is that 14-year-old\nwho wrote that letter? It's not because he didn't try. It's because every time I had a new idea, every time I wanted to try something new, even at work -- I wanted to make a proposal, I wanted to speak up\nin front of people in a group -- I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old\nand the six-year-old. One wanted to conquer the world -- make a difference -- another was afraid of rejection. And every time that six-year-old won. And this fear even persisted\nafter I started my own company. I mean, I started\nmy own company when I was 30 -- if you want to be Bill Gates, you've got to start\nsooner or later, right? When I was an entrepreneur, I was presented\nwith an investment opportunity, and then I was turned down. And that rejection hurt me. It hurt me so bad\nthat I wanted to quit right there. But then I thought, hey, would Bill Gates quit\nafter a simple investment rejection? Would any successful\nentrepreneur quit like that? No way. And this is where it clicked for me. OK, I can build a better company. I can build a better\nteam or better product, but one thing for sure: I've got to be a better leader. I've got to be a better person. I cannot let that six-year-old\nkeep dictating my life anymore. I have to put him back in his place. So this is where I went online\nand looked for help. Google was my friend. (Laughter) I searched, \"How do I overcome\nthe fear of rejection?\" I came up with a bunch\nof psychology articles about where the fear\nand pain are coming from. Then I came up with a bunch\nof \"rah-rah\" inspirational articles about \"Don't take it personally,\njust overcome it.\" Who doesn't know that? (Laughter) But why was I still so scared? Then I found this website by luck. It's called rejectiontherapy.com. (Laughter) \"Rejection Therapy\" was this game\ninvented by this Canadian entrepreneur. His name is Jason Comely. And basically the idea is for 30 days\nyou go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end,\nyou desensitize yourself from the pain. And I loved that idea. (Laughter) I said, \"You know what?\nI'm going to do this. And I'll feel myself\ngetting rejected 100 days.\" And I came up with my own rejection ideas, and I made a video blog out of it. And so here's what I did. This is what the blog looked like. Day One ... (Laughter) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger. So this is where I went\nto where I was working. I came downstairs and I saw this big guy\nsitting behind a desk. He looked like a security guard. So I just approached him. And I was just walking and that was the longest\nwalk of my life -- hair on the back\nof my neck standing up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding. And I got there and said, \"Hey, sir, can I borrow\n100 dollars from you?\" (Laughter) And he looked up, he's like, \"No.\" \"Why?\" And I just said, \"No? I'm sorry.\" Then I turned around,\nand I just ran. (Laughter) I felt so embarrassed. But because I filmed myself -- so that night I was watching\nmyself getting rejected, I just saw how scared I was. I looked like this kid\nin \"The Sixth Sense.\" I saw dead people. (Laughter) But then I saw this guy. You know, he wasn't that menacing. He was a chubby, loveable guy, and he even asked me, \"Why?\" In fact, he invited me to explain myself. And I could've said many things. I could've explained,\nI could've negotiated. I didn't do any of that. All I did was run. I felt, wow, this is like\na microcosm of my life. Every time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as I could. And you know what? The next day, no matter what happens, I'm not going to run. I'll stay engaged. Day Two: Request a \"burger refill.\" (Laughter) It's when I went to a burger joint, I finished lunch,\nand I went to the cashier and said, \"Hi, can I get a burger refill?\" (Laughter) He was all confused,\nlike, \"What's a burger refill?\" (Laughter) I said, \"Well, it's just like\na drink refill but with a burger.\" And he said, \"Sorry,\nwe don't do burger refill, man.\" (Laughter) So this is where rejection happened\nand I could have run, but I stayed. I said, \"Well, I love your burgers, I love your joint, and if you guys do a burger refill, I will love you guys more.\" (Laughter) And he said, \"Well, OK,\nI'll tell my manager about it, and maybe we'll do it,\nbut sorry, we can't do this today.\" Then I left. And by the way, I don't think they've\never done burger refill. (Laughter) I think they're still there. But the life and death feeling\nI was feeling the first time was no longer there, just because I stayed engaged -- because I didn't run. I said, \"Wow, great,\nI'm already learning things. Great.\" And then Day Three:\nGetting Olympic Doughnuts. This is where my life\nwas turned upside down. I went to a Krispy Kreme. It's a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part\nof the United States. I'm sure they have some here, too. And I went in, I said, \"Can you make me doughnuts\nthat look like Olympic symbols? Basically, you interlink\nfive doughnuts together ... \" I mean there's no way\nthey could say yes, right? The doughnut maker took me so seriously. (Laughter) So she put out paper, started jotting down\nthe colors and the rings, and is like, \"How can I make this?\" And then 15 minutes later, she came out with a box\nthat looked like Olympic rings. And I was so touched. I just couldn't believe it. And that video got\nover five million views on Youtube. The world couldn't believe that either. (Laughter) You know, because of that\nI was in newspapers, in talk shows, in everything. And I became famous. A lot of people\nstarted writing emails to me and saying, \"What you're\ndoing is awesome.\" But you know, fame and notoriety\ndid not do anything to me. What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. So I turned the rest\nof my 100 days of rejection into this playground -- into this research project. I wanted to see what I could learn. And then I learned a lot of things. I discovered so many secrets. For example, I found if I just don't run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a \"no\" into a \"yes,\" and the magic word is, \"why.\" So one day I went to a stranger's house,\nI had this flower in my hand, knocked on the door and said, \"Hey, can I plant this flower\nin your backyard?\" (Laughter) And he said, \"No.\" But before he could leave I said, \"Hey, can I know why?\" And he said, \"Well, I have this dog that would dig up\nanything I put in the backyard. I don't want to waste your flower. If you want to do this,\ngo across the street and talk to Connie. She loves flowers.\" So that's what I did. I went across and knocked\non Connie's door. And she was so happy to see me. (Laughter) And then half an hour later, there was this flower\nin Connie's backyard. I'm sure it looks better now. (Laughter) But had I left\nafter the initial rejection, I would've thought, well, it's because\nthe guy didn't trust me, it's because I was crazy, because I didn't dress up well,\nI didn't look good. It was none of those. It was because what I offered\ndid not fit what he wanted. And he trusted me enough\nto offer me a referral, using a sales term. I converted a referral. Then one day -- and I also learned that I can\nactually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes. So for example,\none day I went to a Starbucks, and asked the manager,\n\"Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?\" He was like, \"What's a Starbucks greeter?\" I said, \"Do you know\nthose Walmart greeters? You know, those people who say\n'hi' to you before you walk in the store, and make sure you\ndon't steal stuff, basically? I want to give a Walmart experience\nto Starbucks customers.\" (Laughter) Well, I'm not sure\nthat's a good thing, actually -- Actually, I'm pretty sure\nit's a bad thing. And he was like, \"Oh\" -- yeah, this is how he looked,\nhis name is Eric -- and he was like, \"I'm not sure.\" This is how he was hearing me. \"Not sure.\" Then I ask him, \"Is that weird?\" He's like, \"Yeah, it's really weird, man.\" But as soon as he said that,\nhis whole demeanor changed. It's as if he's putting\nall the doubt on the floor. And he said, \"Yeah, you can do this, just don't get too weird.\" (Laughter) So for the next hour\nI was the Starbucks greeter. I said \"hi\" to every customer\nthat walked in, and gave them holiday cheers. By the way, I don't know\nwhat your career trajectory is, don't be a greeter. (Laughter) It was really boring. But then I found I could do this\nbecause I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\" I mentioned the doubt that he was having. And because I mentioned, \"Is that weird?\",\nthat means I wasn't weird. That means I was actually\nthinking just like him, seeing this as a weird thing. And again, and again, I learned that if I mention\nsome doubt people might have before I ask the question, I gained their trust. People were more likely to say yes to me. And then I learned\nI could fulfill my life dream ... by asking. You know, I came\nfrom four generations of teachers, and my grandma has always told me, \"Hey Jia, you can do anything you want, but it'd be great\nif you became a teacher.\" (Laughter) But I wanted to be\nan entrepreneur, so I didn't. But it has always been my dream\nto actually teach something. So I said, \"What if I just ask and teach a college class?\" I lived in Austin at the time, so I went to University\nof Texas at Austin and knocked on professors' doors\nand said, \"Can I teach your class?\" I didn't get anywhere\nthe first couple of times. But because I didn't run --\nI kept doing it -- and on the third try\nthe professor was very impressed. He was like, \"No one\nhas done this before.\" And I came in prepared\nwith powerpoints and my lesson. He said, \"Wow, I can use this. Why don't you come back in two months?\nI'll fit you in my curriculum.\" And two months later\nI was teaching a class. This is me -- you probably can't see,\nthis is a bad picture. You know, sometimes you get\nrejected by lighting, you know? (Laughter) But wow -- when I finished teaching that class,\nI walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream\njust by simply asking. I used to think I have to accomplish\nall these things -- have to be a great entrepreneur,\nor get a PhD to teach -- but no, I just asked, and I could teach. And in that picture,\nwhich you can't see, I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. Why? Because in my research I found\nthat people who really change the world, who change the way we live\nand the way we think, are the people who were met\nwith initial and often violent rejections. People like Martin Luther King, Jr., like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, or even Jesus Christ. These people did not\nlet rejection define them. They let their own reaction\nafter rejection define themselves. And they embraced rejection. And we don't have to be those people\nto learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman. It has bothered me my whole life\nbecause I was running away from it. Then I started embracing it. I turned that into\nthe biggest gift in my life. I started teaching people\nhow to turn rejections into opportunities. I use my blog, I use my talk, I use the book I just published, and I'm even building technology to help\npeople overcome their fear of rejection. When you get rejected in life, when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure, consider the possibilities. Don't run. If you just embrace them, they might become your gifts as well. Thank you.

But there's one whose main purpose\nis to help people. You may know it as the wheelchair symbol,\nor a sign for people with disabilities, but its formal title as maintained\nby the ISO is the International Symbol of Access. But despite its familiarity, many people are unclear as to what \nthe symbol actually means, which has a lot to do with the symbol\nitself and the way it came about. In 1968, the International Commission\non Technology and Accessibility held a design contest. They were looking for a symbol that would be readily identifiable \nfrom a reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, practical, and couldn't be confused\nwith existing signage. The winning design, \nwhich didn't have a head, was created by a Danish designer\nnamed Susanne Koefed. The addition of a head a year later\ngave it a more human form, and within ten years, it was endorsed by both the United Nations\nand the ISO. With minimal cost and minimal fuss,\na global icon was born. There have been a few tweaks\nover the decades. The Graphic Artists Guild added more\nrounded, human-like features, and in 2012, the Accessible Icon Project\nproduced a more dynamic version. But what does it really represent? What's its purpose? Put simply, it's a sign to identify where\nthere are accessible facilities. The strength of such an internationally\nrecognized image is that wherever you travel, you don't need to speak the language\nor have in-depth cultural knowledge. If you require an accessible toilet,\nthe sign shows the way. But the confusion comes \nfrom the term accessibility and what that actually means. Many people assume that because\nthe symbol depicts a wheelchair, that accessible facilities are meant\nonly for people who use wheelchairs, or those, at the very least,\nwho have a visible physical condition. But accessibility is a broad concept that applies to many, \nmany different conditions. That includes people with autism, visual impairments, and autoimmune diseases, like lupus, which can cause \npain and fatigue, along with many other conditions. In fact, the World Health \nOrganization estimates that there are approximately\n1 billion people who experience some form of disability, which means that this group is very\nlikely to include yourself, or a family member, a classmate, a friend, or a work colleague. And people who use wheelchairs only\nmake up about 65 million, or 15% of the total. The vast majority \nhave non-visible disabilities. Accessible parking spaces, facilities,\nand entrances are designed with \nthat entire group in mind. So it's easy to see why in recent years\npeople have begun to raise questions about whether the symbol is really\nappropriate for what it's meant to do. And it's not just about accuracy. It's common for people \nto become indignant, sometimes abusive, when they see people without visible\ndisabilities using accessible facilities. The symbol is unfortunately creating\nwidespread issues for the very people and families\nit's meant to help. The recent redesigns have attempted\nwith some success to acknowledge concerns \nover the current symbol. But some think that a complete redesign\nis in order. It's a difficult task, though.

But one day you're suddenly brought\nbefore the emperor, who looks even angrier than usual. One of his 12 governors has been convicted\nof paying his taxes with a counterfeit coin, which has already made its way \ninto the Treasury. As the kingdom's greatest mathematician, you’ve been granted a chance to earn \nyour freedom by identifying the fake. Before you are the 12 identical looking\ncoins and a balance scale. You know that the false coin will be very\nslightly lighter or heavier than the rest. But the emperor’s not a patient man. You may only use the scale three times before you’ll be thrown \nback into the dungeon. You look around for\nanything else you can use, but there's nothing in the room,\njust the coins, the scale, and your trusty marker. How do you identify the counterfeit? Pause now to figure it out yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Obviously, you can't weigh each coin\nagainst all of the others, so you’ll have to weigh several coins\nat the same time by splitting the stack \ninto multiple piles, then narrowing down where\nthe false coin is. Start by dividing the 12 coins \ninto three equal piles of four. Placing two of these on the scale\ngives us two possible outcomes. If the two sides balance, \nall eight coins on the scale are real and the fake must be among \nthe remaining four. So how do you keep track of these results?\nThat’s where the marker comes in. Mark the eight authentic\ncoins with a zero. Now take three of them and weigh them\nagainst three unmarked coins. If they balance, the remaining unmarked\ncoin must be the fake. If they don’t, draw a plus \non the three unmarked coins if they’re heavier, \nor a minus if they’re lighter. Now take two of the newly marked coins\nand weigh them against each other. If they balance, the third coin is fake. Otherwise, look at their marks. If they are plus coins, \nthe heavier one is the impostor. If they are marked with minus,\nit's the lighter one. But what if the first two piles\nyou way don't balance? Mark the coins on the heavier side\nwith a plus and those on the lighter side \nwith a minus. You can also mark the remaining four\ncoins with zeros, since you know the fake one \nis already somewhere on the scale. Now you'll need to think strategically so you can remove all remaining ambiguity\nin just two more ways. To do this, you’ll need \nto reassemble the piles. One method is to replace three \nof the plus coins with three of the minus coins and replace those\nwith three of the zero coins. From here, you have three possibilities. If the previously heavier side \nof the scale is still heavier, that means either the remaining \nplus coin on that side is actually the heavier one, or the remaining minus coin on the \nlighter side is actually the lighter one. Choose either one of them and weigh it \nagainst one of the regular coins to see which is true. If the previously heavier side \nbecame lighter, that means one of the three minus coins\nyou moved is actually the lighter one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third is counterfeit. If not, the lighter one is. Similarly, if the two sides balanced\nafter your substitution, then one of the three plus coins \nyou removed must be the heavier one. Weigh two of them against each other. If they balance, the third one is fake. If not, then it's the heavier one.

But how did the festive Christmas \ntradition of kissing under mistletoe come about? The long lived custom intertwines \nthe mythology and biology of this intriguing plant. There are more than 1,000 species of\nmistletoe which grows the world over. In fact, the ancient Europeans\nwere so captivated by the plant’s unusual growth habits \nthat they included it in their legends and myths. In ancient Rome, Pliny the Elder \ndescribed how the Druid priesthood in ancient England\nbelieved that mistletoe was a plant dropped down from heaven \nby the gods; that explained its unlikely position \namongst the high branches of certain trees. They also believed it had powers \nof healing and bestowing fertility. Meanwhile, Scandinavian legends told \nof the plant’s mystical qualities in the story of the god Baldur\nand his adoring mother, Frigg, goddess of love, marriage and fertility. Frigg loved her son so much \nthat she commanded every plant, animal and inanimate object to vow \nthey’d never harm him. In her fervor, however, \nshe overlooked the mistletoe. The mischievous god Loki realized \nthis oversight, and pierced Baldur’s heart with an arrow \ncarved from a mistletoe branch. Frigg cried tears of such\nsadness that they formed the mistletoe’s pearly berries, making the other gods pity her \nand agree to resurrect Baldur. Hearing the news, Frigg became \nso overjoyed that she transformed the mistletoe from a symbol of death\ninto one of peace and love. She mandated a one day\ntruce for all fights and that everyone embraced beneath \nits branches when they passed to spread more love into the world. In the 17th century, British colonists \narriving in the New World found a different but very similar looking\nspecies of mistletoe. They applied it to these tales\nof magic, fertility and love, spreading the mistletoe hanging tradition\nfrom Europe into America. By the 18th century, people \nin Britain had turned this into a Christmas tradition. But this custom comes down to more \nthan just human imagination. All of it was inspired\nby the plant’s intriguing biology. We see mistletoe as a festive decoration,\nbut draped on tree boughs in the wild, it’s known as a partly parasitic plant. Mistletoe relies on modified roots\ncalled haustoria that penetrate the tree bark \nand siphon off the water and minerals trees carry up their trunks. To colonize nearby trees with its seeds, mistletoe depends on birds \nand other creatures to do the dispersing. Birds that eat the mistletoe’s \nsticky white berries sometimes get rid of the gluey seeds\nby wiping them off onto tree bark, or with a bit of luck, they excrete the indigestible seed\nonto a tree where it germinates and starts to grow. With its resilience and foliage \nthat stays lush even while the surrounding trees \nlose their leaves, you can see why mistletoe captivated\nour superstitious ancestors. They saw these as signs of the plant’s\nmagical qualities and fertility. Even today, the mistletoe inspires wonder with the diversity of wildlife\nit supports. More than just a parasite, \nit’s also known as a keystone species. It's eaten by a diversity of animals,\nincluding deer, elk, squirrels, chipmunks, porcupines, robins, bluebirds, \nmourning doves, and the butterfly genus Delius. Some mistletoe species\nproduce dense bushes, which are excellent nesting locations\nfor a variety of birds. And despite their parasitic\nrelationship with trees, mistletoes can also help other plants. For instance, juniper sprouts \nnear mistletoe to benefit from the visiting berry-eating birds. Through the many benefits it provides, mistletoe influences diversity \nand allows ecosystems to flourish. You might even say, \nthat for this iconic plant, life imitates legend. In the wild, mistletoe has the power \nto bring things together.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 19, "title": "The Future of Air Travel", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/PF5wJlNR", "transcript": {"en": "Why can’t I just get on a plane and go from,\nlike, Montana to London, in a couple hours? I just want to experience the thrill of zooming\nthrough the sky faster than the speed of sound? Well, if you flew on a Concorde jet back before\nthey were grounded -- or you happen to be a fighter pilot -- then you’ve probably\nexperienced faster-than-sound travel. And, some companies are looking to make supersonic\nflight a reality again, with new commercial planes that travel faster than the speed of\nsound. And someday, you might be able to fly over\nthe Atlantic Ocean in an hour -- or even less. Problem is, most people don’t want to fly\non a plane that feels like an out-of-control rocket. And there’s also the problem of faster-than-sound\nplanes becoming ridiculously hot and unbearably loud. So engineers have some developing to\ndo. On the morning of December 17th, 1903, Orville\nWright became the first human to successfully pilot an airplane -- a heavier-than-air vehicle\nthat was controlled, powered, and sustained. His flight lasted 12 seconds, and crossed\n120 feet of a North Carolinian beach -- with an average speed of almost 11 kilometers an\nhour. By the end of the day, his brother Wilbur\nflew the same airplane for almost a whole minute, with an average speed of almost 16\nkilometers an hour. Less than a century later, in the 1970s, commercial\nplanes went supersonic -- faster than the speed of sound. A few dozen supersonic planes were in regular\nservice, available in two models, the Concorde and the Soviet Tupolev. But the Tupolev only\nmade 55 passenger flights, from 1977 to 1978. And after a Concorde crashed in 2000, people\nstarted to fly on them less. Eventually, they just weren’t financially\nworth it anymore, and the planes were retired in 2003. 13 years later, there still aren’t any new\ncommercial faster-than-sound planes. But soon, there might be! There are just a\ncouple of improvements companies are trying to make first. The main challenge comes from getting past\nwhat’s known as Mach 1. See, sound usually travels around 1230 kilometers\nper hour, but that’s not a constant number -- it depends on things like the temperature\nand humidity of the air. So, when it comes to planes, it’s easier\nto talk about speed in Mach numbers, which take into account the speed of sound in the\nparticular place where the plane is flying.. Mach 1 is just the speed of sound. Anything\nslower than that is called subsonic, and anything faster is called supersonic. But switching from subsonic to supersonic\nisn’t easy, because the plane has to overcome the infamous sound barrier. And that can be a problem, because the sound\nbarrier is sometimes strong enough to tear away at planes, and even send them crashing\nto the ground. The sound barrier exists because of the way\nsound waves travel: by compressing and stretching the air they travel through. The compressed air ends up at a higher pressure,\nand the stretched air has lower pressure. As a plane moves, it produces sound waves\nthat shift the air back and forth, creating areas of lower and higher pressure. But as the plane gets faster, it starts to\ncatch up with those waves. New sound waves start to form on top of the\nold sound waves, causing huge swings between higher and lower pressure air. Those differences in pressure can rattle and\nshake planes like toys, and there’s a real danger of tearing them to pieces. Low pressure areas can also lead to drops\nin temperature, condensing any moisture in the air and forming a visible cloud, sometimes\nknown as a vapor cone. The first plane that could get past the sound\nbarrier was the Bell X-1, built in 1947. It was designed to absorb 18 times the force\nof gravity, and modeled after a machine gun bullet. It didn’t actually lift off from the ground\non the zone, though -- it was dropped from a larger mothership plane, known as the B-29,\nso it got a bit of a head start. By the mid-1970s, supersonic planes were ready\nfor commercial use -- with the UK and France designing the concorde, and the Soviet Union\ndesigning the Tupolev. The Concorde flew passengers from London to\nNew York in about three and a half hours -- about half the time it would take in a plain old\nsubsonic commercial plane. But they only flew that one route, and there’s\na reason they spent as much time over the water as possible: the painfully disruptive\nsonic boom. Like the sound barrier, sonic booms come from\na build-up of compressed sound waves, known as a shock wave. The shock wave heads away from the plane,\nwhich you hear as a VERY loud boom -- so powerful that they’re sometimes mistaken for earthquakes. And those sonic booms don’t just happen\nonce, like when a plane breaks the sound barrier. They continue throughout the entire supersonic\nflight. That’s because the sound waves keep bunching\nup behind the plane, then expanding outwards, creating a cone shape known as the Mach cone. So wherever the plane flies over land, people\nhear that incredibly loud boom. So that’s why the Concorde’s supersonic\ncommercial flights only really happened between western Europe and eastern North America. If they flew over land, odds are people would\nnot have appreciated the booms. And even though you can’t fly on a Concorde\nanymore, you might still be able to fly on a supersonic plane someday. NASA, for example, is looking into how to\ndampen the effects of the sonic boom. One way to do that might be by moving one,\nor even two engines above the wings, which would direct shockwaves upwards. So the sonic\nbooms would happen in the sky, rather than on the ground. Then there’s the Concorde 2, which Airbus\nis working on. The Concorde 2 would first fly directly upward,\nto an altitude of about 30 kilometers. Then, the plane would rotate its tail fin\nin a way that would redirect the shock waves to be horizontal, so you wouldn’t feel them\nas much on the ground. The Concorde 2 would be able to accelerate\nup to Mach 4.5 -- and at those speeds, it could take passengers from London to New York\nin an hour. But maybe that’s not enough, what if you\nwant to go faster? The Concorde 2 would be very close to going\nbeyond supersonic, and into an even faster category, known as hypersonic. When people talk about hypersonic speeds,\nthey’re generally talking about Mach 5 or higher -- more than five times the speed of\nsound. Those speeds get their own category, because\nthat’s when the temperature of the plane becomes a bigger issue. The plane is flying through the air so quickly\nthat friction with particles in the air is a real problem, because it makes a lot of\nheat. At hypersonic speeds, planes need to be able\nto withstand temperatures over 1000 degrees celsius… but almost all of the more typical\nmetals would melt, or at least become very weak, at temperatures below that. The other challenge is the engine, because\na regular jet engine wouldn’t work. Standard, subsonic planes use large rotating\nblades to compress incoming air, inject fuel, and then let it burn. Propelling them forward. At supersonic speeds, it becomes even easier,\nbecause the high speeds already compress the air. In that case, the engine doesn’t even need\nthe blades -- that’s what’s known as a ramjet engine. Ram, because the air is just rammed into the\nengine. At hypersonic speeds, though, this plan doesn’t\nwork as well. Sure, the air is compressed, but it’s moving\nso fast that there’s not enough time for it to combust and actually help move the plane. So hypersonic planes need their own fuel and\ntheir own oxygen -- which is what NASA used in the X-15, the first plane to reach hypersonic\nspeeds. It used a titanium skin to protect itself\nfrom the extreme temperatures, and was able to fly at Mach 6.72. It also flew high enough that some of the\nX-15 test flights are considered space flights. But the X-15 is not the kind of plane that\ncould be used commercially. For one thing, it burned through fuel so fast that it would\nrun out in less than two minutes. Also, pilots sometimes experienced 8 times\nthe force of Earth’s gravity, and most people wouldn’t consider that a comfortable business\ntrip. So, until engines became more efficient and\npractical, commercial hypersonic planes are a long way from reality. And the scramjet\nmight be the answer. Scramjet engines work kind of like ramjets\ndo, but they’re designed to handle the faster-moving air. In testing, NASA’s found that they could\nwork at speeds up to Mach 15, at least in theory. There’s one big drawback, though: scramjet\nengines only work at hypersonic speeds. The X-43A, for example, an unmanned test plane\nthat uses a scramjet, has to be accelerated above Mach 5 before it can fly on its own. It’s strapped to a booster rocket, which\nis then loaded onto a subsonic plane. Alright, stay with me... The plane flies up to about 6 kilometers above\nthe ground, then releases the X-43A, along with the rocket, which gets to about 30 kilometers\nup and to speeds of Mach 5. Then the X-43A can start its flight. So, it might be a while before hypersonic\nplanes are a practical way to get across the Atlantic. But a future where a trip to the other side\nof the world involves flying faster than the speed of sound, without painful sonic booms\nfor the people on the ground? That might not be so far off.

(Spoiler: much higher than 10) - James Tanton", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-high-can-you-count-on-your-fingers-spoiler-much-higher-than-10-james-tanton", "transcript": {"en": "How high can you count on your fingers? It seems like a question \nwith an obvious answer. After all, most of us have ten fingers, or to be more precise, eight fingers and two thumbs. This gives us a total of ten digits\non our two hands, which we use to count to ten. It's no coincidence that the ten symbols\nwe use in our modern numbering system are called digits as well. But that's not the only way to count. In some places, it's customary to\ngo up to twelve on just one hand. How? Well, each finger is divided \ninto three sections, and we have a natural pointer\nto indicate each one, the thumb. That gives us an easy to way to count\nto twelve on one hand. And if we want to count higher, we can use the digits on our other hand to\nkeep track of each time we get to twelve, up to five groups of twelve, or 60. Better yet, let's use the sections\non the second hand to count twelve groups of twelve,\nup to 144. That's a pretty big improvement, but we can go higher by finding more\ncountable parts on each hand. For example, each finger \nhas three sections and three creases for a total of six things to count. Now we're up to 24 on each hand, and using our other hand to mark\ngroups of 24 gets us all the way to 576. Can we go any higher? It looks like we've reached the limit\nof how many different finger parts we can count with any precision. So let's think of something different. One of our greatest \nmathematical inventions is the system of positional notation, where the placement of symbols allows\nfor different magnitudes of value, as in the number 999. Even though the same symbol is used\nthree times, each position indicates a different\norder of magnitude. So we can use positional value on\nour fingers to beat our previous record. Let's forget about finger sections\nfor a moment and look at the simplest case of having\njust two options per finger, up and down. This won't allow us to represent \npowers of ten, but it's perfect for the counting system\nthat uses powers of two, otherwise known as binary. In binary, each position has double\nthe value of the previous one, so we can assign \nour fingers values of one, two, four, eight, all the way up to 512. And any positive integer,\nup to a certain limit, can be expressed \nas a sum of these numbers. For example, the number seven\nis 4+2+1. so we can represent it by having\njust these three fingers raised. Meanwhile, 250 is 128+64+32+16+8+2. How high an we go now? That would be the number with all ten\nfingers raised, or 1,023. Is it possible to go even higher? It depends on how dexterous you feel. If you can bend each finger just halfway,\nthat gives us three different states - down, half bent, and raised. Now, we can count using \na base-three positional system, up to 59,048. And if you can bend your fingers\ninto four different states or more, you can get even higher. That limit is up to you,\nand your own flexibility and ingenuity. Even with our fingers in just two\npossible states, we're already working pretty efficiently. In fact, our computers are based\non the same principle. Each microchip consists of tiny\nelectrical switches that can be either on or off, meaning that base-two is the default way\nthey represent numbers. And just as we can use this system to\ncount past 1,000 using only our fingers, computers can perform billions \nof operations just by counting off 1's and 0's."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In the English language, the word digit refers to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A finger, a thumb, or a toe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Any one of the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 used for writing numbers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The third number within a third group of twelve is 27.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 21, "title": "Why all world maps are wrong", "category": "Design", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/uTE96JbJ", "transcript": {"en": "If I want to turn this globe into a flat map, I’m going to have to cut it open. In order to get this to look anything like a rectangle. I've had to cut it in places. I've had to stretch it so that the countries look all wonky. And even still, it's almost impossible to get it to lie flat. And that right there is the eternal dilemma\nof map makers: The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form\nof distortion. This guy proved that with math a long time\nago. Since around 1500s, mathematicians have set\nabout creating algorithms that would translate the globe into something flat. To do this, they use a process called projection. Popular rectangular maps use a cylindrical\nprojections. Imagine putting a theoretical cylinder over\nthe globe and projecting each point of the sphere onto the cylinder’s surface. Unroll the cylinder, and you have a flat,\nrectangular map. But you could also project the globe onto\nother objects, and how exactly a map maker projects the globe will affect what the map\nlooks like once it’s all flattened out. And here’s the big problem: Every one of\nthese projections comes with trade offs in shape, distance, direction and land area. Certain map projections can be either misleading\nor very helpful depending on what you are using them for. Here’s an example. This map is called the Mercator projection. If you’re American, you probably studied\nit in school. It’s the projection Google Maps uses. Mercator projection is popular for a couple\nof reasons. First, it generally preserves the shape of\nthe countries. Brazil on the globe has the same shape as\nBrazil on the Mercator projection. But the real purpose of the Mercator projection\nwas navigation -- it preserves direction, which is a big deal if you are trying to navigate\nthe ocean with only a compass. It was designed so that a line drawn between\ntwo points on the map would provide the exact angle to follow on a compass to travel between\nthose points. If we go back into a globe, you can see that\nthis line is not shortest route. But it provides a simple, reliable way to\nnavigate across oceans. Gerardus Mercator, who created the projection\nin the 16th century, was able to preserve direction by varying the distance between\nlatitude lines while also making them straight, creating a grid of right angles.. But that created other problems. Where mercator fails is its representation\nof size. Look at the size of Africa as compared to\nGreenland. On the mercator map they look about the same\nsize. But look at a globe for Greenland’s true\nsize, and you’ll see it’s way smaller than Africa. By a factor of 14 in fact. If we put some dot that are all the same size\non a globe, then we projected as a mercator map, we would end up with this. The circles retain their shape but are enlarged\nthe closer you get the poles. One modern critique is that this distortion\nperpetuates imperialist attitudes of European domination over the southern hemisphere \"The Mercator projection has fostered imperialist attitudes for centuries and created a ethnic bias against the third world.\" \"Really?\" If you want to see a map that more accurately\ndisplays size, you can use the Gall-Peters projection, which is called an equal-area\nmap. Look at Greenland and Africa. The size comparison is now accurate. Much better than the mercator. but it’s obvious that the country shapes\nare now stretched. Here are the dots again so you can see how\nthe projection preserves area while totally distorting shape. Something happened in the late 60s that would\nchange the whole purpose of mapping and the way we think about projections. Satellites orbiting our planet started sending\nlocation and navigation data to little receiver units all over the world. This global positioning system wiped out the\nneed for paper maps as a means of navigating both the seas and the sky. Map projection choices became less about navigational\nimperatives and more about aesthetics, design, and presentation. The mercator map, that vital tool of pre-GPS\nnavigation, was shunned by cartographers who now saw it as misleading. But most web mapping tools like Google maps\nstill use the mercator. According to Google this is because the Mercator’s\nability to preserve shape and angles makes close-up views of cities more accurate -- a\n90 degree left turn on the map is a 90degree left turn on the street you’re driving down. But when trying to display something on a\nworld map, cartographers rarely use the mercator. Most modern cartographers have settled on\na variety of non-rectangular projections that split the difference between totally distorting\neither size or shape. In 1998 The National Geographic Society adopted\nThe Winkel tripel projection because of it’s a pleasant balance between size and shape\naccuracy. But the fact remains, that there is no one\nright projection. cartographers and mathematicians have created\na huge library of available projections, each a new perspective on the planet. The best way to see what the earth really\nlooks like is to look at a globe. But as long we use flat maps, we will deal\nwith the tradeoffs of projections, Just remember: there’s no right answer."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A surface of a sphere such as Earth cannot be represented as a plane...", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "with accurate direction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "without distortion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "accurately"}, {"label": "D", "text": "b and c only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Every type of map projection has an issue when it comes to...", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "land area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "distance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "shape"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a and b only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The Mercator projection type of map is popular due to", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "its utility for navigation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "it preserves the shape of countries pretty well"}, {"label": "C", "text": "it preserves direction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which type of map represents the size of each of Earth's landmasses accurately?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "equal area map"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mercator projection"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gall-Peters projection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both a and c"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above are acceptable answers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In the 1960's what revolutionized maps?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "GPS systems"}, {"label": "B", "text": "satellites"}, {"label": "C", "text": "globes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both a and b"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

That earned him the name\nthe Teflon Don after one of the slipperiest \nmaterials on Earth. Teflon was in the spacesuits the Apollo\ncrew wore for the moon landing, in pipes and valves used \nin the Manhattan Project, and maybe in your kitchen as the nonstick\ncoating on frying pans and cookie sheets. So what is this slippery solid,\nand why doesn't anything stick to it? Teflon is a brand name for\npolytetrafluoroethylene, or PTFE. It was stumbled upon accidentally in 1938\nby a 27-year-old American chemist named Roy Plunkett while he was trying to develop \na non-toxic refrigerant fluid for DuPont, a chemicals company. The strange, white substance that formed\ninside his lab canister was chemically inert, meaning it wouldn't react \nwith other substances. It also had an extremely \nlow coefficient of friction, making other materials slide right off it. Teflon's properties make it perfect\nwhen you need something slippery, chemical resistant, or waterproof, which means it has a lot of applications. It can be found all over the place, as a coating on raincoats, industrial ball bearings, artificial joints, circuit boards, and even the Rocky Mountains-themed roof\nof the Denver International Airport. The incredible properties of PTFE\ncome from its molecular structure. It's a polymer, meaning it's made of long chains of\nrepeating units of atoms strung together. A PTFE chain has a backbone \nof carbon atoms, each of which is attached \nto two fluorines. The fluorine atoms surround the carbon\nlike armor, spiraling around the chain, and the bond between carbon and fluorine\nis incredibly tight. Like a couple that ignores everyone\nexcept each other, carbon and fluorine interact so strongly that the normal, intermolecular forces\nthat help substances stick to each other don't stand a chance. Even the famously adhesive feet of geckos\nusually can't get a grip. But wait! If PTFE doesn't stick to anything, how can it be so firmly attached\nto something like a pan? One method involves sandblasting the pan or etching it with chemicals \nto make it rough. Then, a special primer is applied,\nwhich acts like glue. Its exact composition is a trade secret\nguarded by each manufacturer. The pan is sprayed with liquid PTFE and heated to around \n800 degrees Fahrenheit. The layers then solidify into\na smooth, slick coating. When you later cook eggs\nin this PTFE-coated pan, the extra tight carbon-fluorine bonds just ignore the water and fat and protein\nmolecules in the eggs. Without those interactions, the food just slides around \nwithout sticking. You might wonder if it's safe to cook\nin a PTFE-coated pan. The answer is yes, if you're careful. PTFE is stable at moderate temperatures,\nlike you'd use to cook eggs or fish, but above 500 degrees Fahrenheit,\nit starts to degrade, and heating it further releases fumes\nthat can make you feel sick. An empty pan can reach 500 degrees fast\nover high heat, but most kitchens are ventilated \nwell enough to dissipate the fumes. People used to also think \nthat accidentally consuming PTFE that flaked off a scratched pan\nwas bad for you, but the current consensus \nis that it's harmless. Because PTFE doesn't interact with other\nchemicals very well, it isn't thought to break down\ninside your body. Whether it's safe to manufacture Teflon\nis another story. DuPont and its spin-off company Chemours now face lawsuits \nworth millions of dollars. They've been accused of polluting\nthe environment for decades and exposing employees \nand local communities to health risks associated \nwith a toxic chemical called PFOA. That chemical was involved\nin manufacturing Teflon. As for John Gotti, in 1992, the Mob boss was finally \nconvicted of five counts of murder, among other charges. That prompted the head of the FBI office\nin New York City to announce, \"The Teflon is gone.

{"page": 34, "lesson": 23, "title": "Why Don't Ants Get Stuck In Traffic?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/VR7dKcVX", "transcript": {"en": "[MUSIC] This episode is supported by Prudential [MUSIC] With more than 7 billion people on Earth and\none car for every six of us, traffic is bad just about everywhere. [HONKING] Last year, American drivers wasted nearly a million collective years staring at each\nother’s tail-lights. The average driver in London has it the worst,\nspending more than four days a year in gridlock. \"There's Big Ben, kids! Parliament!\" But Earth is home to another great commuter,\nwhose populations number in the trillions, and they don’t get stuck in traffic. An army ant’s day is a lot like ours. Set off in the morning alongside thousands\nof our neighbors, moving out and back in neat little lines so we can provide for our brood… I mean family. Crowding, bottlenecks, slowpokes, ants face\nthe same traffic challenges we do. But they don’t get in traffic jams, which\nis why scientists are looking to them for solutions to human traffic. In a perfect world cars could pack in bumper\nto bumper and drive at that magic speed, but we’re not perfect. One wrong tap on the gas or brakes, and OH\nCOME ON! GET MOVING! When speed and density hit a tipping point,\njams are inevitable. Yet in the ant world, traffic jams don’t\nhappen, even when things get crowded. The easiest solution to an overcrowded road\nis to make it bigger. But ants can’t just cut trails as wide as\nthey want. Wider roads take time and energy to maintain,\nand the pheromones that mark them become weaker. Instead, ants get organized. It might not look like it, but there’s lanes\nhere. Ants headed back to the colony loaded up with\nfood use the center lane, while outbound ants stay to the edges. Why three lanes and not two, like our roads? When two ants are on a collision course, eventually\none’s gotta give. The loaded inbound ants are less maneuverable,\nso the empty-handed ant almost always turns first, half the time to either side. And voila: three lanes, no crashes, no traffic\njams. If you think you’re so different from an\narmy ant, pay attention next time you’re in a busy crosswalk. We naturally form similar lanes in crowds,\nmindless individuals contributing to a larger pattern. But put us behind the wheel, and this happens. [HONKING] There’s a simple reason we hate traffic. Because we hate waiting in line. Queueing up plays weird tricks on our brains’\nsense of time. Occupied time feels shorter than unoccupied\ntime. This is why people listen to the radio, or\nplay that license plate game. And it’s the same reason supermarkets put\nmagazines in the checkout lines. Ever been late for a big meeting and felt\nlike the universe is standing in your way? Anxiety makes waits seem longer. Ever been in a traffic jam with no obvious\ncause? The worst. Uncertain or unexplained waits are longer\nthan known or explained waits. But traffic engineers have learned that simple\ninformation signs can change how we experience delays. But more than anything else, we hate unfair\nwaits. You see a sign that says “lane closed ahead”,\nso you get over with plenty of time to spare, only to see some jerk zip past you and get\nover at the last second. What… you can’t wait like the rest of\nus, Mr. Hurrypants? Quick side note. Gonna let you in on a little secret. Traffic researchers have found that late merging\nis actually better. If everyone drives up to the bottleneck and\ngoes one-by-one like a zipper, traffic moves up to 15% faster. We use both lanes at max capacity, no one\ngets cheated, everyone wins! The more you know. And where were we? Oh yeah. Our innate sense of “what’s fair” leads\nto the biggest psychological illusion that we experience on the road. Why does traffic always move faster in the\nother lane? Well, spoilers first: It doesn’t. Let’s say two cars enter your standard stop-and-go\ntraffic jam side by side. Let’s count the time each one spends passing\nversus getting passed. One driver zips past a few cars in the other\nlane, only to stop and wait and watch other cars pass. And then go! WOO HOO! And then wait. Even if the two cars cross some invisible\nfinish line together, the same way they started, each driver will feel like they spent more\ntime being passed than passing, because they did. Our brains pay more attention to the losses\nthan the gains. All of this points to the real problem with\ntraffic. Our ego. Human drivers care about minimizing their\ntravel time and don’t give two honks about what other drivers want. Driving slower may be faster for everyone\nelse, but it’s not faster for me! I don’t care if we all get where we’re\ngoing at the same time, I don’t like being passed! When leaf-cutter ants get stuck on a twig\nbehind a heavily-loaded slowpoke, do they honk and yell bad ant words? No! They simply slow down and march behind the\nant returning with the goods, because that’s what’s best for the group. Worker ants are all related and working toward\nthe same goal, the good of the colony. That’s the cooperative genetic programming\nthat underlies their awesome traffic systems. The fact that we have big, complicated brains\nis the very reason that we get stuck in traffic and ants don’t. We think of traffic as something that happens\nto us rather than admitting we are the problem. Ants are essentially tiny machines with simple\nprogramming. Put them on a trail with a few rules, allow\nindividuals to communicate and interact with each other, and voila, you’ve got complex\ntraffic networks running at near-maximum efficiency. Sound familiar? It should! That’s basically what we’ll get when we\nstop letting our egos drive and put traffic in the hands of a network of self-driving\ncars optimized to serve the collective good. Sure, sentient machines may enslave humanity,\nbut at least they’ll cut down on our commute! But that’s a video for another day. Stay curious. Thanks to Prudential for sponsoring this episode.

You probably haven't actually seen\nany of these things, but you could imagine them instantly. How does your brain produce an image\nof something you've never seen? That may not seem hard, but that's only because \nwe're so used to doing it. It turns out that this is actually\na complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination\ninside your brain. That's because to create \nthese new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces \nand assembles them in new ways, like a collage made \nfrom fragments of photos. The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands\nof electrical signals getting them all to their destination\nat precisely the right time. When you look at an object, thousands of neurons \nin your posterior cortex fire. These neurons encode various \ncharacteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow. This synchronous firing strengthens the\nconnections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known\nas a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple. In neuroscience, this is called\nthe Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together. If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up,\nassembling a complete mental image. Dolphins are encoded by a different\nneuronal ensemble. In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble \nassociated with it, the neurons wired together\nby that synchronized firing. But this principle doesn't explain\nthe infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations\nwithout ever seeing them. The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin\nbalancing a pineapple doesn't exist. So how come you can imagine it anyway? One hypothesis, \ncalled the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key. If the neuronal ensembles \nfor the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects\nas a single image. But something in your brain \nhas to coordinate that firing. One plausible candidate \nis the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in \nall complex cognitive functions. Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected\nto the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions\ncalled neural fibers. The mental synthesis theory proposes\nthat like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send\nelectrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles\nin the posterior cortex. This activates them in unison. If the neuronal ensembles are turned on\nat the same time, you experience the composite image\njust as if you'd actually seen it. This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles\nby the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis. In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both\nneuronal ensembles at the same time. The problem is that some neurons are much farther away \nfrom the prefrontal cortex than others. If the signals travel down both fibers\nat the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync. You can't change the length \nof the connections, but your brain, \nespecially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change \nthe conduction velocity. Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty\nsubstance called myelin. Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals \nzipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural fibers have \nas many as 100 layers of myelin. Others only have a few. And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals \n100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones. Some scientists now think that this\ndifference in myelination could be the key \nto uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, \nto our mental synthesis ability. A lot of this myelination \nhappens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot\nto do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies\nthroughout our lives."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the role of myelin in the brain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To speed up the transmission of signals between neurons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To reduce metabolic energy consumption by preventing ions from leaking from neuron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To increase the conduction velocity in longer fibers compared to shorter fibers in order to establish an uniform conduction time."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Hebbian principle is based on the principle that: “Neurons that fire together, _____.”", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wire together"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Encode memory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Create conscious"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spend more energy than neurons that fire separately"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements about a neuronal ensemble is untrue?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All neurons of a neuronal ensemble have enhanced connections to each other"}, {"label": "B", "text": "All neurons of a neuronal ensemble tend to fire together in resonance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neuronal ensemble encode memories of an object or an event"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All neurons of a neuronal ensemble are located in the close physical proximity in the brain"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In what tasks would you expect to see a deficit in a lobotomy patient?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Orientation in a new apartment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Recognizing their spouse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Remembering multiplication tables"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Playing chess"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the role of myelin in the brain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To speed up the transmission of signals between neurons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To reduce metabolic energy consumption by preventing ions from leaking from neuron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To increase the conduction velocity in longer fibers compared to shorter fibers in order to establish an uniform conduction time."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which activity necessarily involves mental synthesis (mental synthesis is conscious purposeful prefrontal cortex-controlled imagination)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Remembering your grandmother"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hallucinating with vivid colors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dreaming during sleep about space travel and flying"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reading a new fairy tale"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
