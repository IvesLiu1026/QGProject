So for that I'll return to this blackboard here I found in the Simpsons, and I discussed in this video up there. And particularly that infinite series down there at the bottom. Okay, so it's 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + 1/5, all the way to infinity - an infinite series, with sum log 2 [ln(2)]. So that's about...0.69. What I want to do here is something that somebody discovered about 150 years ago So just, just see what I do, it's a bit of a paradox. So what I do is I take a bit more of this, and I really need the whole board, so we'll take out every fourth term, and then what's left over has odd denominator and even denominator terms, so let's separate those out, too. Now we're going to work our way in from the left, ah, pick those two guys  and put them down there, take those two guys, and put them down in the gap, take those two guys and put them down in the next gap, and you keep on going like this, and obviously when you do this, you use up all the terms that were there in the beginning, and just rearrange them here and rebracket them a little bit. Now we're going to work our way through the brackets, so first one here, (1 - 1/2) is 1/2. (1/3 - 1/6) is 1/6 And so on, right, so we can see how this works, this nice pattern here, um, that's what happens, so we've just rearranged the terms, and we rebracketed them a little bit, and that shouldn't change anything about the sum of this thing, right? So, if you compare what we've got now to what we started with, well, the bit that we started with is what? ln(2). But now we can compare term by term, so one half of 1 is 1/2. One half of 1/2 is 1/4. And half of 1/3 is 1/6, and so on, and so what you see is that term by term. The bit at the bottom here is always one half of the bit at the top, and so what it means is it should really be equal to ... 1/2*ln(2). Now if you put all this stuff together, you get ln(2) is equal to 1/2*ln(2),  which really amounts the same thing as saying that 1 is equal to 2. *groans tiredly* *laughing* and whenever you come across something like this, you start worrying. So there's really, you know, two different options here, the first one is maths is broken. Or, we made a mistake. What do you think is more likely here, well, yes, we made a mistake. So where's the mistake? So let's have a close look, so there was three different identities, so here, here, and there. So two of these are correct, and one of these is not correct. So, the first bit, well, I already said this, and just believe me, this is equal to ln(2). Then the bottom bit is also correct. In fact, that bracketing here, and I'll just say this now, you can put in brackets anywhere you want, it's not going to change anything about this sum here. It's always going to add up to 1/2*ln(2) here, that's correct. So what's really messing things up is that we are rearranging the terms, so we're changing the order of the terms. And that really creates an infinite series with a different sum than the one before. So basically when we're dealing with these infinite series, unlike with the finite ones, order matters, and rearranging may change the sum. Okay, well some people are getting really worried oh no,  maths is broken anyway, no it's not broken - we just have to get used to this. *laughs* we gotta be careful about this sort of stuffs. So we just saw that we can rearrange this series into another series with a different sum, and actually there's a famous mathematician, Riemann, Bernhard Riemann, who came up with a theorem, the Riemann rearrangement theorem, which says that, well, in this case of this particular series, you can rearrange this thing into series that add up to anything you want. For example, π, and I'm going to show you how that is done, how he...how he makes up these different sums. Now you've probably heard this name, the Riemann hypothesis, is at the moment the most sought after thing that you can prove in mathematics. So eternal fame awaits if you can do this, and that's all about the Riemann zeta function, and there's also the Riemann integral, which you use all the time, and lots and lots of Riemann named bits in mathematics, so this guy is  a mathematical superhero. Usually, when it comes to these things that are named after him, they are quite...difficult to explain properly, but that Riemann rearrangement theorem I can do like this with my animation magic. So let's just do it, but before we do it,  I really have to remind you of what it actually means for one of those series to add up to a certain number, okay, so what we do is we translate this, series, into a sequence of numbers, the 'partial sums', the sequence of partial sums. So the first partial sum is just the first term, which is 1, the second partial sum is just those two guys added up. That's...0.5 in this case, and then, third partial sum, fourth partial sum, and so you get this sequence of numbers here, and in the case of this series, the sequence of numbers 'converges' to a certain number. which is ln(2). And then we say that this series has sum, that number, ln(2) in this case. That's the definition of a sum of an infinite series. This is an example of a 'convergent' series. A series that actually has a sum which is a finite number. Ah, now there's also lots of series that don't converge. And they are called 'divergent'. So for example, if we replace all the minuses in here by pluses, I already showed in that other video up there, that this adds up to +∞. But there's other types of divergence, For example, if we take this guy there, that's 1 - 1 + 1 - 1+... ; the partial sums here are 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 They don't settle down to anything; not finite, not infinite, that's also divergent. So there are different sorts of divergent. To explain what's going on here, let's have a look at the positive terms, and the negative terms separately. So if you just add up all the positive terms, you'll actually find you get ∞. And if you actually add up the negative terms, you get -∞. And, actually if you've watched the other video you should be able to prove that yourself, and maybe do it in the comments. So what we're really doing here is we're subtracting ∞ from ∞ in a controlled manner. What Riemann's rearrangement theorem says is that if you've got a convergent series, whose positive terms add up to ∞, and whose negative terms add up to -∞, then you can rearrange the series into series that have any sum you want. So let me demonstrate this now for π, with this particular series. Okay, so we want pi. [CAPTIONER'S NOTE: Don't we all, Mathologer :)] That's positive, so we're going to start with some positive terms. So the first term of my new series is going to be 1. So the first partial sum is also going to be 1. The partial sums, I put up there. Now, that is not enough, so we add a few more of those positive terms, let's get close to π. Now we actually have to add quite a few of them to get close to π, we are still just under here, so let's add one more, and that gets us just over. This string of terms, we choose as the beginning bit of our new series. So we're just over, now we're going to use some negative terms to get just under. Okay, so we use the, actually, the -1/2 is good enough, so, that gets us under. *thoughtful pause* 2.6 and so on. *dramatic pause* Alright, now let's go over again, so for that,  we'll just use some positive terms. Um, we actually need quite a few again, but we can be absolutely sure that we can get over because, at any stage of this process, the positive terms that are left over will add up to ∞, and the negative terms that are left over will add up to ∞, so I can always be sure that no matter how far I'm under, or how far I'm over, I can always take enough terms to get under or over. Alright, now we can just keep on going like this, so then a negative term to get us under again, then a positive, positive terms again to get us over, and we go, flip back and forth, and eventually we get to π. And we can also be sure that we get to π because the terms themselves, they get smaller and smaller in magnitude, so that means that as I overshoot and undershoot, I get closer and closer to π. And actually,  uh, I can rearrange this initial series in infinitely many ways, different ways, to get me π; I can also rearrange it to get me an infinite sum, all sorts of other things, so maybe you'll also want to do this in the comments, figure out the details there. Now, for other series, you can actually have the situation where nothing changes no matter what you do. So there's lots of convergent series where the positive terms add up to a positive number and the negative terms add up to a negative number, so for example, it could be, you know, 2, the positive terms, and minus 7, the negative terms. And then, no matter how you reshuffle,  this series, the sum will always be 2 - 7 is -5. Okay, now there's something else that we're actually doing here, we're actually bracketing, alright, so we're bracketing. So we can bracket like this, we can bracket like that, or maybe we don't do any brackets whatsoever, And actually, as long as we're dealing with, infinite series, that converge, either this type or of that type, doesn't matter what, you can put in brackets wherever you want, and the sum won't change. So I mean, that's a bit reassuring *chuckles anxiously* so, basically commutativity is broken, but but, uh, associativity, at least for convergent series, doesn't get mucked up, so it's quite nice. *excited* BUT, there's at least one more surprise happening here; that's just for convergent series. So if you actually look at some divergent series, strange things can happen even when you bracket them. So for example, this guy here, the 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 divergent series, if you just bracket it right, you'll actually get a convergent series. with a certain sum, and actually you can bracket this in many, many different ways, and get different sums out. And maybe that's also a puzzle for you to sort out; how can you rebracket this thing to get different, different sums out? Well, there's really amazing things to be discovered yet, um, the first one is basically saying, and you can actually, with what I showed you today, you can actually figure out the details yourself. *deep breath* is that if I give you an arbitrary infinite series, there's three different cases; so you can ask, in how many different sums can I rearrange this thing? So the first case is, no matter how I rearrange this thing, I'll never get a sum. The second case is it rearranges in all possible...sums. And the third case is, it just is one sum, no matter how you rearrange it. Now this gets even freakier when you are considering infinite series of complex numbers, or infinite series of vectors, and you can do this in Banach spaces, and you can do this in all kinds of other things, but maybe, maybe that's um, *exhales* maybe that's enough for today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "By rearranging and rebracketing the terms for this convergent series, it changed the sum of the equation.

I mean, skinny jeans can get a little uncomfortable,\nyes. And maybe you have a friend who spends more\ntime waxing his mustache and trimming his beard than he does actually bathing himself. But your fashion choices probably won’t\nkill, burn, or poison you. However, people haven't always been so lucky. Historically, some pretty dangerous clothing,\ncosmetics, and accessories have come in vogue, endangering their wearers and makers alike. It turns out there are just some things that\nyou really don’t want to put on or in your body… even if everyone else is doing it. [INTRO] Let’s start in the 1700s, when skirts were\nhuge, cool guys wore wigs, and the hottest color in Europe was green. Specifically, two special pigments known as\nScheele’s Green and Emerald Green. In 1775, Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele\ndeveloped copper arsenate, an intense, yellow-green pigment that was more brilliant and longer-lasting\nthan any other green dye. It was also a lot more toxic because it was\nmade with arsenic. German scientists soon improved on Scheele’s\nrecipe by inventing an even more vivid green dye -- copper acetoarsenite, commonly known\nas Emerald Green or Paris Green. And society loved it. They used it to decorate everything from fake\nplants to ball gowns. For fashionistas, the danger emerged when\nthey’d sweat through their green gloves, stockings, or socks, and transfer the toxins\nto their skin. This caused chemical burns and open sores\nthat absorbed even more of the poison. A poisonous dust would also flake off of dyed\nobjects, especially wallpapers or twirling dresses as people danced at balls. If you breathed in enough arsenic, the poisoning\ncould cause vomiting, ulcers, nerve damage, and eventually even death. But arsenic pigments weren’t the only harmful\nones. Some of the first synthetic dyes for clothes\nand shoes could cause some pretty nasty health problems all on their own. Aniline is a toxic organic compound that was\nfirst isolated from the indigo plant in the 1820s. When ingested, it interferes with blood cells’\nability to carry oxygen. But in 1856, a chemistry student named William\nHenry Perkin was trying to use aniline to create an antimalarial drug, when he accidentally\ncreated mauveine, a bright purple dye. And soon, aniline dyes were all the rage. Their vibrant reds and deep blacks made natural\ndyes look muted by comparison. But I bet you can guess what happened next. People who wore socks, gloves, and shirts\ncolored with aniline, or shoes that had been shined with an aniline-based polish, often\nsuffered inflammatory skin reactions or headaches and dizziness… because the dye was poisoning\ntheir blood. Our next dangerous trend is more like a single\nhorrible incident. The culprit in this case was zinc chloride,\nwhich wasn’t used to dye fabrics, but it was used in a coating that goes on wool to\nprotect the fabric. The compound had, and still has, lots of applications,\nbecause it’s both highly corrosive and highly soluble in water. But, one day, in December 1898, over 60 men\nwere hired to clean the streets of Birmingham, England after a snowstorm. And they were all given new wool overcoats\nto keep them warm. Nice, right? Well, most of the men ended up in the hospital,\nwith large patches of destroyed skin around their knees and wrists. It turns out, their coats had been treated\nwith an excess of zinc chloride, and when they got wet from the snow, the toxin dripped\nonto their skin and caused serious chemical burns. Now, we’ve talked before about how asbestos\nhas been misused over the ages. But before anyone knew that asbestos equals\ndying, it was often worn for protection. It can form lightweight fibers that can be\nwoven into fabric, and it's famously flame retardant. So, from ancient Rome until at least the early\n1980s, lots of dangerous, fire-related jobs involved wearing uniforms with some amount\nof asbestos in them. This was especially true for firefighters. But, asbestos fibers are incredibly dangerous\nfor human health. Even when they’re woven into clothing, asbestos\nfibers can break off into tiny pieces that can enter the lungs. When too many fibers build up in your lungs,\nthey cause irritation, inflammation, and scarring, hindering the ability to absorb oxygen and\nmaking it hard to breathe. Asbestos is also a carcinogen. People who are exposed to large amounts of\nit tend to develop an otherwise-rare lung cancer called mesothelioma. So even though we were using it as protection,\nasbestos was doing tremendous damage to our bodies all along. Another fabric that proved to be more harmful\nthan we expected is viscose rayon. In the late 1800s, chemists were looking for\nan artificial substitute for natural silk, which, as sexy as it is, is incredibly time-consuming\nand expensive to produce. In 1905, a British company began making a\nnew material: They started with a sticky solution of dissolved wood pulp, which contains lots\nof the natural plant polymer cellulose. They aged it, dumped in some chemicals, and\neventually extracted fibers that looked and felt a lot like silk. We know those fibers today as rayon. One of the key steps in making viscose rayon\ninvolved a compound called carbon disulfide, which is -- as you might guess-- highly toxic! The fabric was safe to wear, but factory workers\nsuffered. Prolonged exposure to carbon disulfide can\ndamage the cardiovascular and nervous systems. This was linked to behavioral and health problems\namong workers ranging from bouts of mania to strokes. But even with these hazards, the popularity\nof artificial silk kept booming, well into the 1900s. So you might know the Mad Hatter from Lewis\nCarroll’s Alice in Wonderland -- kind of crazy, drinks a lot of tea? Turns out, he might have some basis in reality. The phrase “mad as a hatter” was actually\nused to describe industrial hat-makers in the mid-1800s, who were poisoned by mercury\njust by doing their jobs. Most hats were felted, or made from the fur\nof small animals. And to make felt, hatters used a process called\n“carroting,” where they washed the pelts in an orange solution containing mercury nitrate\nto separate the fur from the skin and shrink it into a thin mat. But the price they paid for dapper hats was\nmercury poisoning, which drastically harmed hatters’ central nervous systems. Mercurial disease, or Mad Hatter Disease,\ncauses extreme emotional states plus physical effects, like tremors and difficulty walking,\nspeaking, and writing. Since these hats didn’t poison the general\npublic, the occupational hazards of being a hatter persisted. It took half a century or longer for countries\nto start banning the use of mercury in the felt hat industry. But what about cosmetics? One fashion trend that emerged in the 1500s\nwas an obsession with blindingly white skin. In 16th and 17th-century England, women painted\ntheir faces with a whitening paste called Venetian ceruse. The pigment was made by mixing metallic lead\nwith acetic acid -- also known as vinegar -- in the presence of carbon dioxide to make\nlead carbonate, a powdery white lead. This gave the illusion of a snow-white face,\nbut over time, it would eat away at people’s skin and caused scarring, headaches, nausea,\nmuscle damage, baldness, and eventually early death. In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie famously discovered\nradium, in the form of radium chloride, by extracting it from the radioactive mineral\ncalled uraninite, or pitchblende. After a couple decades of work, in 1910, they\nwere able to isolate radium as a pure metal. And this discovery not only thrilled scientific\nresearchers, but it also caused a wave of “science-based” consumer goods to sweep\nthe world. We are talking... radium makeup! For example, the London-based Radior in 1917\nused radium in products like face creams, soaps, powders, and blush. In the 1930s, ladies in Paris could wear Tho-Radia\nbrand cosmetics, made from both thorium chloride and radium bromide -- apparently, the more\nradioactive elements, the better. Thankfully, most of these products contained\nsuch low amounts of radium that they were pretty much harmless -- although it’s possible\nthat customers suffered health effects later in life. Instead, the most serious poisoning cases\nwere in the factories where radium products were made. Especially in the “Radium Girls,” a group\nof about 4,000 factory workers in the United States who painted watch faces with glowing\npaint and were pretty much bathed in radioactive dust every day. By the 1920s, they began to suffer from anemia,\n“radium jaw” and bone cancers. Within about 20 years, largely because of\ntheir plight, radium-branded products had all but disappeared from the market. And people weren’t just putting toxins on\ntheir face for the sake of beauty. They also put poison in their eyes to look\nmore attractive. The poison in question here is atropine, a\ncompound derived from a poisonous plant called Deadly Nightshade, or Atropa belladonna. “Belladonna” means “beautiful lady”\nin Italian, and it stems from a dangerous beauty practice. In some ancient cultures, women were said\nto put drops of juice from Deadly Nightshade berries in their eyes to dilate, or enlarge,\ntheir pupils for that striking doe-eyed look. Atropine is a smooth muscle relaxant, and\nyour irises are full of smooth muscles that expand and contract to let in different amounts\nof light. By adding atropine to your eye, you’re stopping\nyour iris from being able to respond to light. Putting lots of atropine in your eyes is a\npretty horrible idea, because constantly dilated eyes can expose your retinas to too much light,\ndamaging the sensory tissues and affecting your vision. Plus, forcing your eye muscles into unnatural\npositions has been found to affect your internal eye pressure and damage your optic nerve,\nwhich could lead to blindness. Today, doctors still use atropine for its\nmuscle relaxing and anesthetic effects, mainly to dilate your pupils before eye exams. They just use it in very small, controlled\ndoses. Finally, let’s go out with a bang with combustible\nfashion accessories! Celluloid was the most successful early, synthetic\nplastic. It was cheap, light, strong, easily molded\nto whatever shape you wanted. So in the late 1800s and early 1900s, celluloid\naccessories were everywhere -- buttons, jewelry, eyeglass frames, toys, and little hair combs\nthat ladies would wear. But, what people didn’t realize was that\ncelluloid was manufactured using a compound called cellulose nitrate. Now, cellulose is that naturally-occurring\nplant polymer I mentioned earlier. And when you expose cellulose, like in wood\npulp or cotton, to nitric acid, it forms cellulose nitrate -- which is highly flammable. So flammable that it’s also called guncotton\nbecause of its tendency to … explode. So with the rise in popularity of celluloid\naccessories came a wave of newspaper articles about combs combusting in people’s hair,\nsetting their whole body on fire, just from the heat from a curling iron or a nearby electric\nlamp. There were even reports of entire stores burning\ndown because they stored their celluloid stuff too close to windows and mirrors on hot summer\ndays. So, in comparison, those skinny jeans and\nmustache waxes don’t seem so bad now, do they? All told, it’s much safer to commit a fashion\nfaux-pas than have your skin burned or your hair catch on fire, all because of a trend.

In fact, each day, the animal kingdom \nproduces roughly enough dung to match the volume of water pouring \nover the Victoria Falls. So why isn’t the planet covered \nin the stuff? You can thank the humble dung beetle \nfor eating up the excess. Capable of burying 250 times \ntheir body weight in a single night, these valiant insects make\nquick work of an endless stream of feces. Over 7,000 known species of dung beetle \nrun clean-up duty across six continents —everywhere except Antarctica. A dung beetle’s first task \nis to locate dung. Some live on the anal regions \nof larger animals, ready to leap off when they defecate. Others sniff out feces \nthat animals leave behind. A pile of elephant dung can attract \n4,000 beetles in 15 minutes. So once a beetle finds dung, it must work quickly to secure \nsome of the bounty for itself. Most dung beetle species fall into one \nof three main groups: rollers, tunnelers, and dwellers. Dung rollers sculpt a ball of dung,\nand using their back legs, quickly roll it away from competitors. Potential partners jump on the ball, and once the ball-maker \nhas selected their mate, the pair dig their dung ball \ninto the soil. Once it’s been buried, the female lays \na single egg within the dung ball. Tunnelers have a different approach. Digging underneath a pat, \nsome drag dung down into the soil and pack it into clumps \nknown as brood balls, dung balls, or dung “sausages,” \ndepending on their shape and size. Male tunnelers sport a spectacular \narray of horns to fight each other\nfor control of these tunnels, which they then defend \nuntil the female’s laid her egg. Some male tunnelers avoid the fray\nby masquerading as hornless females and sneaking into tunnels to mate \nwhile the guardians’ heads are turned. The third group of dung beetles, dwellers, take the most straightforward approach, laying their eggs\ndirectly into a dung pat. This makes their offspring\nmore vulnerable to predation than those of the tunnelers and rollers. As the larvae feed, they riddle \nthe dung pat with tunnels, leaving remains that are quickly colonized\nby bacteria and fungi and weathered away. Inside a tunnel, ball, or pat, \nonce the larvae hatch, they consume the dung \nbefore metamorphosing into a pupa and then an adult beetle. Besides clearing dung, \nthe actions of these beetles have considerable ecological importance. For one, they serve as secondary \nseed dispersers. Dung from monkeys, wild pigs, and other animals is riddled with seeds \nfrom the fruits they eat. When beetles bury their dung balls, they inadvertently protect these seeds \nfrom predators and increase the likelihood \nthey’ll germinate. The advantage is so great \nthat one South African plant has evolved to produce seeds that look \nand smell like dung to trick beetles into burying them. Dung beetles also play important roles \nin agricultural systems. Livestock, like cows and sheep,\nproduce huge amounts of dung, which contains nutrients \nthat can benefit plants. The beetles break up the dung \nand tunnel it deep into the soil, bringing the nutrients into close contact\nwith plant roots. Their services to farmers have been valued\nat $380 million a year in the US and £367 million a year in the UK. Dung beetles can even help us battle \nglobal warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions\nassociated with farming. Microbes living in oxygen-poor \nlivestock dung produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But beetles oxygenate pats when \nthey tunnel into them, preventing the microbes\nfrom producing methane. The dung beetle spreads seeds, helps farmers, and fights climate change —and accomplishes it all\nsimply by doing its business. Maybe next time you come across \nsome dung in the forest or a field, you’ll be tempted to take a closer look."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Through tunneling and aerating cow dung, dung beetles can reduce the production of which greenhouse gas?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "N2O (nitrous oxide)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "H2O (water vapour)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "CH4 (methane)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "CO2 (carbon dioxide)"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Dung beetles are capable of burying up to ______ their own body weight in dung.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100 times"}, {"label": "B", "text": "250 times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "500 times"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10 times"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are the three main groups that dung beetles can be classified into?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rollers, tunnelers, dwellers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rollers, jumpers, diggers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tunnelers, pushers, pullers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rollers, walkers, flyers"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are the life stages of a dung beetle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egg, baby, adult"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Egg, larva, adult"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Egg, larva, pupa, adult"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Larva, pupa, adult"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Through tunneling and aerating cow dung, dung beetles can reduce the production of which greenhouse gas?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "N2O (nitrous oxide)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "H2O (water vapour)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "CH4 (methane)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "CO2 (carbon dioxide)"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Globally, there are roughly ______ species of dung beetle.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "7,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "15,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30,000"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Dung beetles are capable of burying up to ______ their own body weight in dung.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100 times"}, {"label": "B", "text": "250 times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "500 times"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10 times"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

This is an 85-inch LCD TV, and whenever I'm playing something on it or watching something on it, my eyes and brain are\nbeing misled and tricked, giving me the illusion of\nwatching a moving object when in fact I'm just\nwatching several still images just shown to me very, very fast. If I'm watching a film, I'm being shown 24 images\nevery second, and to my eyes, that looks like I'm\nlooking at a moving object when in fact I'm looking\nat 24 individual pictures. If I'm playing a game, it's the same, except maybe 30 to 60 frames a second, and if I'm on a PC, it could be 100s, PC master race. But a TV like this is actually incapable of showing you one image and\nthen 1/24 of a second later just switching all at\nonce to the next image, and to illustrate this next point, I'm gonna use a very old\nand very crap CRT TV. That stands for cathode ray tube. If you've ever seen one of these filmed, you may notice that it looks\nslightly different on camera than it does to your eye. Look at that. The reason it looks like this is because the shutter speed\nof this camera is out of sync with the refresh rate of this screen. The frame is constructed\nfrom the top to the bottom multiple times per second; that's 60 times in the US, 60 Hertz. I've prepared for you\nsome high speed footage that I shot a long time ago on the v2511 of this screen and this\nscreen and some others. A lot of it is Dan paying \"Super Mario\" on the NES extremely badly. Here's the TV and the\ncat played back at 25; this is how it would be\nperceived in real time. And now at 1600 frames a second, you can actually see the scan line moving from the top to the bottom, and you'll notice that on a CRT screen, it's only the active line\nof pixels that's bright, and your persistence of vision will actually build that\ninto a complete image. It's messing with my eyes, this. - It's like a dance floor. Oh, I didn't even make\nit past the first guy. - Slowed all the way down\nto 2500 frames a second, you can now differentiate\neach individual frame being built from top to bottom. It takes an extremely fast camera to see that each frame\nis built line by line from top to bottom, but it\ntakes an even faster camera to see that each line is\ndrawn from left to right. Slowed down to 28,500 frames a second, we're now seeing glimpses of that, but we do need to go even slower. This is now 118,000 frames a second, and I'm gonna put the\nstats up for you here so you can see the actual\namount of time that it took, and you can see now that\nthe line is being drawn from left to right on the screen. Now at 146,000 frames a second, to gain perspective on just\nhow slow this actually is, you can see the exact time I shot this. So this is hours, it\nwas just past midnight, 23 minutes, 41 seconds,\nthis is 1/10 of a second, 1/100 of a second, 1/1000 of\na second or a millisecond, and then over here you've\ngot 1/10,000 of a second, 1/100,000 of a second, and this unit here is the millionth of a\nsecond, or a microsecond. We are now at 380,000 frames a second as our recording frame rate. That is the highest frame\nrate we've ever shot so far on this channel,\nand using this information, here's a little bonus fact: a CRT screen can draw Mario's mustache in less than 1/380,000 of a second. That is some seriously fast facial hair. And if you're wondering why this footage looks extremely mucky and blurry, it's because the resolution\nis only 256 by 128, which, plonked into a\n4K frame, is this big. That CRT screen is standard def; this is a 4K screen, which\nmeans it's 3840 by 2160 pixels. That's over eight million pixels. So think of the processing\npower that this TV has to have to update an image that big\nthat many times every second. The first thing you'll notice\nabout a modern LCD screen is that it's not only\nthe active line of pixels that retains brightness;\nit's the entire image. So you can actually see the full image as each scan-line passes down the screen. This is every frame of the\nstart-up sequence on an Xbox One. I also recorded myself\nplaying a game of \"Halo\". Nothing will make you feel\nworse about your performance than watching your lousy aim\nin slow mo, look at that. It's crazy to think that\nwhen you're playing \"Halo\", this is actually what\nis happening on your TV. If only you could see at this speed, your aim would be incredible. It honestly makes me feel bad when I fall asleep watching TV, knowing that this TV is\ndoing all this intensive work changing literally 10s of\nmillions of pixels every second, and there's no one there watching it. Here's a fun fact: the\nsame applies to an iPhone, except it's in portrait mode. So if you're watching a video in landscape mode on your iPhone, you're actually getting\nupdates from left to right, or right to left, depending on\nwhich way you've flipped it, and that just proved to me that you can't see the refresh direction with your naked eye,\nbecause I had no idea, whenever I was watching a\nYouTube video on my iPhone, that the screen was updating in a completely different direction. I'm not sure if this is the\ncase for all smartphones, but it's certainly the\ncase on an iPhone 7 Plus, which is what I filmed this on. So we've talked about one illusion of TVs, the illusion of movement. The second illusion I wanna talk about is the illusion of color. For this next part, I'm\ngonna need a second camera. Here's one, that's you, hello, you. So in order to film this\nscreen extremely close, I'm gonna have to set my focus to the minimum possible distance, so it's sort of like right here now. Set to my minimum focus, as I slowly move towards the screen, it becomes sharper, and you will then, at the last minute, see a very odd looking pattern. And what you're seeing there is an effect caused by the camera, this camera, trying to resolve individual pixels on the surface of this screen. As I push further forward,\nthe effect disappears, and everything goes out of focus. That's because I'm now beyond\nthe minimum focal distance of this lens, which is about,\nwell, that's about there. Not close enough. In order to get closer, I'm\ngonna need a macro lens. Here's one. As I approach the white, and everything starts to become in focus, you can see that white\nisn't so white anymore. It looks like I have to\ngo closer even than that. Thankfully, I can go all the way to five times magnification. Now, one thing from this point, I am definitely gonna need a tripod, because there's no way my arms are sturdy enough to hold this in place, but I'll just ease it in just to show you the level of magnification\nwe're talking about now. Well, this close, it's a\ndifferent story altogether. I'm gonna get a tripod. Here's one. What a mission this is, all right, let's see what we can do here. We're so close up right now that I can actually disturb this image by blowing on the lens. We're now looking at the sub-pixel level. A pixel is made up of three sub-pixels, red, green, and blue, RGB, you\nmay have heard that before, and this creates the\nillusion of different colors. By dimming and brightening\ndifferent sub-pixels to different intensities,\nthis screen can create the illusion of literally\nmillions of different colors. When all three are lit to full\nbrightness, you get white. When all three dim, you go through gray all the way down to black. So if green dims away, and\nred and blue are still lit, then you go into magenta,\npurple, that sort of area, and that's how the colors are made. So every time on your TV you're\nlooking at a white image, you're looking at tons of\nblue, green, and red lights. They're just so small they\nlook like white to your eye. Before you get white;\nred, green, and blue blurs into yellow, cyan, and magenta, and that's what happens here when I move the screen\nslightly out of focus. This is too close to watch\na Slow Mo Guys video. I might vomit. It's the same situation, just entire blocks and they're bigger. As I mentioned before,\nthis is a 4K LCD screen, which, a while back, were typically lit by CCFLs, or a cold\ncathode fluorescent lamp, which means the entire panel is backlit by fluorescent tubes. Nowadays, they are backlit by LEDs. This is why this would actually\nbe marketed as an LED TV. The benefit of LED\nscreens over CCFL screens is that they're a lot thinner. Now I'm gonna point it at\nwhere some black text is. Now, interestingly, even\nthough this area is black because all the sub-pixels have dimmed, they are still in fact backlit. Let me show you that right now. Now you can see, as we push in here, you have to pardon the noise, we're at an extremely high ISO to get this shot through a macro lens, but you can see even the dimmed pixels, part of the liquid crystal display as it's now trying to block all light from penetrating through, but\nit's still a backlit pixel, and that's one of the\nfundamental limitations of an LCD screen. You can see this effect on an LCD screen in the credits of a film, 'cause you've got an almost\ncompletely black image, but because there's white text, the entire backlight has to\nbe on to display the white, which means light will leak\nout from the black pixels, which means it's not true black. There is another technology that's becoming much\nmore common these days, and that is an OLED screen,\norganic light-emitting diode. I did wanna include a comparison between an LCD panel and an OLED panel, but I didn't actually have an OLED TV, and by sheer luck, right in the middle of me shooting all this footage, LG got in touch and offered\nto supply me with an OLED TV for the purpose of making this video, which I really appreciate. Thanks, LG. Why don't we go and take a look at it. This is a 77-inch LG OLED TV. The way OLED technology works is that each pixel is self-illuminating, depending on how much voltage\nis passing through it, which means there's no\nglobal backlight on the TV. Each pixel is individually in\ncontrol of how bright it is, and it's not being lit from behind. And that means, when we go\nto our high ISO experiment, just like we did on the LCD, that when there's an area\nof black on the screen, all of those pixels are off, and you can see here where\nI'm putting my cursor in front of the lens, you can see each sub-pixel lighting up and then completely turning\noff when it goes away. This technology means much deeper blacks, and the possibility of a very thin screen. And there you have it: a brief explanation of how a TV works in slow mo. If you found that video interesting, chances are you might find\nsome other videos interesting on this channel, so make sure you boop, and once you've booped,\nfeel free to check out our it's just there. Thank you very much for watching. That was good timing, weren't it? TV timed out, and now there's fireworks."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In a TV, each frame takes an extremely fast camera to see that each line is drawn from ____ to ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Up, down"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Left, right"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What three sub pixels make up a pixel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Red"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Green"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Blue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

For me, it just took 11,000 volts. I know you're too polite to ask, so I will tell you. One night, sophomore year of college, just back from Thanksgiving holiday, a few of my friends and I\nwere horsing around, and we decided to climb atop\na parked commuter train. It was just sitting there,\nwith the wires that run overhead. Somehow, that seemed\nlike a great idea at the time. We'd certainly done stupider things. I scurried up the ladder on the back, and when I stood up, the electrical current entered my arm, blew down and out my feet,\nand that was that. Would you believe that watch still works? Takes a licking! (Laughter) My father wears it now in solidarity. That night began my formal relationship\nwith death -- my death -- and it also began\nmy long run as a patient. It's a good word. It means one who suffers. So I guess we're all patients. Now, the American health care system has more than its fair share\nof dysfunction -- to match its brilliance, to be sure. I'm a physician now,\na hospice and palliative medicine doc, so I've seen care from both sides. And believe me: almost everyone\nwho goes into healthcare really means well -- I mean, truly. But we who work in it\nare also unwitting agents for a system that too often\ndoes not serve. Why? Well, there's actually a pretty easy\nanswer to that question, and it explains a lot: because healthcare was designed\nwith diseases, not people, at its center. Which is to say, of course,\nit was badly designed. And nowhere are the effects\nof bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity\nfor good design more compelling than at the end of life, where things are so distilled\nand concentrated. There are no do-overs. My purpose today is\nto reach out across disciplines and invite design thinking\ninto this big conversation. That is, to bring intention and creativity to the experience of dying. We have a monumental\nopportunity in front of us, before one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society: to rethink and redesign how it is we die. So let's begin at the end. For most people, the scariest thing\nabout death isn't being dead, it's dying, suffering. It's a key distinction. To get underneath this,\nit can be very helpful to tease out suffering\nwhich is necessary as it is, from suffering we can change. The former is a natural,\nessential part of life, part of the deal, and to this we are called\nto make space, adjust, grow. It can be really good\nto realize forces larger than ourselves. They bring proportionality, like a cosmic right-sizing. After my limbs were gone, that loss, for example,\nbecame fact, fixed -- necessarily part of my life, and I learned that I could no more\nreject this fact than reject myself. It took me a while,\nbut I learned it eventually. Now, another great thing\nabout necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that unites caregiver and care receiver -- human beings. This, we are finally realizing,\nis where healing happens. Yes, compassion -- literally,\nas we learned yesterday -- suffering together. Now, on the systems side,\non the other hand, so much of the suffering\nis unnecessary, invented. It serves no good purpose. But the good news is,\nsince this brand of suffering is made up, well, we can change it. How we die is indeed\nsomething we can affect. Making the system sensitive\nto this fundamental distinction between necessary\nand unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three\ndesign cues for the day. After all, our role as caregivers,\nas people who care, is to relieve suffering --\nnot add to the pile. True to the tenets of palliative care, I function as something\nof a reflective advocate, as much as prescribing physician. Quick aside: palliative care -- a very\nimportant field but poorly understood -- while it includes, it is not\nlimited to end of life care. It is not limited to hospice. It's simply about comfort\nand living well at any stage. So please know that you don't\nhave to be dying anytime soon to benefit from palliative care. Now, let me introduce you to Frank. Sort of makes this point. I've been seeing Frank now for years. He's living with advancing prostate cancer\non top of long-standing HIV. We work on his bone pain and his fatigue, but most of the time we spend thinking\nout loud together about his life -- really, about our lives. In this way, Frank grieves. In this way, he keeps up with\nhis losses as they roll in, so that he's ready to take in\nthe next moment. Loss is one thing,\nbut regret, quite another. Frank has always been an adventurer -- he looks like something\nout of a Norman Rockwell painting -- and no fan of regret. So it wasn't surprising\nwhen he came into clinic one day, saying he wanted to raft\ndown the Colorado River. Was this a good idea? With all the risks to his safety\nand his health, some would say no. Many did, but he went for it,\nwhile he still could. It was a glorious, marvelous trip: freezing water, blistering dry heat,\nscorpions, snakes, wildlife howling off the flaming walls\nof the Grand Canyon -- all the glorious side of the world\nbeyond our control. Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic, is exactly the kind\nso many of us would make, if we only had the support to figure out\nwhat is best for ourselves over time. So much of what we're talking about today\nis a shift in perspective. After my accident,\nwhen I went back to college, I changed my major to art history. Studying visual art, I figured\nI'd learn something about how to see -- a really potent lesson\nfor a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was seeing. Perspective, that kind of alchemy\nwe humans get to play with, turning anguish into a flower. Flash forward: now I work\nat an amazing place in San Francisco called the Zen Hospice Project, where we have a little ritual\nthat helps with this shift in perspective. When one of our residents dies, the mortuary men come, and as we're\nwheeling the body out through the garden, heading for the gate, we pause. Anyone who wants -- fellow residents, family,\nnurses, volunteers, the hearse drivers too, now -- shares a story or a song or silence, as we sprinkle the body\nwith flower petals. It takes a few minutes; it's a sweet, simple parting image\nto usher in grief with warmth, rather than repugnance. Contrast that with the typical experience\nin the hospital setting, much like this -- floodlit room\nlined with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights that don't stop\neven when the patient's life has. Cleaning crew swoops in,\nthe body's whisked away, and it all feels as though that person\nhad never really existed. Well-intended, of course,\nin the name of sterility, but hospitals tend to assault our senses, and the most we might hope for\nwithin those walls is numbness -- anesthetic, literally\nthe opposite of aesthetic. I revere hospitals for what they can do;\nI am alive because of them. But we ask too much of our hospitals. They are places for acute trauma\nand treatable illness. They are no place to live and die;\nthat's not what they were designed for. Now mind you -- I am not\ngiving up on the notion that our institutions\ncan become more humane. Beauty can be found anywhere. I spent a few months in a burn unit at St. Barnabas Hospital\nin Livingston, New Jersey, where I got really\ngreat care at every turn, including good\npalliative care for my pain. And one night, it began to snow outside. I remember my nurses\ncomplaining about driving through it. And there was no window in my room, but it was great to just imagine it\ncoming down all sticky. Next day, one of my nurses\nsmuggled in a snowball for me. She brought it in to the unit. I cannot tell you the rapture I felt\nholding that in my hand, and the coldness dripping\nonto my burning skin; the miracle of it all, the fascination as I watched it melt\nand turn into water. In that moment, just being any part of this planet\nin this universe mattered more to me than whether I lived or died. That little snowball packed\nall the inspiration I needed to both try to live\nand be OK if I did not. In a hospital, that's a stolen moment. In my work over the years,\nI've known many people who were ready to go, ready to die. Not because they had found\nsome final peace or transcendence, but because they were so repulsed\nby what their lives had become -- in a word, cut off, or ugly. There are already record numbers of us\nliving with chronic and terminal illness, and into ever older age. And we are nowhere near ready\nor prepared for this silver tsunami. We need an infrastructure\ndynamic enough to handle these seismic shifts in our population. Now is the time to create\nsomething new, something vital. I know we can because we have to. The alternative is just unacceptable. And the key ingredients are known: policy, education and training, systems, bricks and mortar. We have tons of input\nfor designers of all stripes to work with. We know, for example, from research what's most important to people\nwho are closer to death: comfort; feeling unburdened\nand unburdening to those they love; existential peace; and a sense\nof wonderment and spirituality. Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years, we've learned much more\nfrom our residents in subtle detail. Little things aren't so little. Take Janette. She finds it harder to breathe\none day to the next due to ALS. Well, guess what? She wants to start smoking again -- and French cigarettes, if you please. Not out of some self-destructive bent, but to feel her lungs filled\nwhile she has them. Priorities change. Or Kate -- she just wants to know her dog Austin is lying\nat the foot of her bed, his cold muzzle against her dry skin, instead of more chemotherapy\ncoursing through her veins -- she's done that. Sensuous, aesthetic gratification,\nwhere in a moment, in an instant, we are rewarded for just being. So much of it comes down to\nloving our time by way of the senses, by way of the body -- the very thing\ndoing the living and the dying. Probably the most poignant room in the Zen Hospice guest house\nis our kitchen, which is a little strange when you realize that so many of our residents\ncan eat very little, if anything at all. But we realize we are providing\nsustenance on several levels: smell, a symbolic plane. Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff\nhappening under our roof, one of the most tried and true\ninterventions we know of, is to bake cookies. As long as we have our senses -- even just one -- we have at least\nthe possibility of accessing what makes us feel human, connected. Imagine the ripples of this notion for the millions of people\nliving and dying with dementia. Primal sensorial delights that say\nthe things we don't have words for, impulses that make us stay present -- no need for a past or a future. So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out\nof the system was our first design cue, then tending to dignity\nby way of the senses, by way of the body --\nthe aesthetic realm -- is design cue number two. Now this gets us quickly to the third\nand final bit for today; namely, we need to lift our sights,\nto set our sights on well-being, so that life and health and healthcare can become about making life\nmore wonderful, rather than just less horrible. Beneficence. Here, this gets right at the distinction between a disease-centered and a patient-\nor human-centered model of care, and here is where caring\nbecomes a creative, generative, even playful act. \"Play\" may sound like a funny word here. But it is also one of our\nhighest forms of adaptation. Consider every major compulsory effort\nit takes to be human. The need for food has birthed cuisine. The need for shelter\nhas given rise to architecture. The need for cover, fashion. And for being subjected to the clock, well, we invented music. So, since dying\nis a necessary part of life, what might we create with this fact? By \"play\" I am in no way suggesting\nwe take a light approach to dying or that we mandate\nany particular way of dying. There are mountains of sorrow\nthat cannot move, and one way or another,\nwe will all kneel there. Rather, I am asking that we make space -- physical, psychic room, to allow life\nto play itself all the way out -- so that rather than just\ngetting out of the way, aging and dying can become\na process of crescendo through to the end. We can't solve for death. I know some of you are working on this. (Laughter) Meanwhile, we can -- (Laughter) We can design towards it. Parts of me died early on, and that's something we can all say\none way or another. I got to redesign my life\naround this fact, and I tell you it has been a liberation to realize you can always find\na shock of beauty or meaning in what life you have left, like that snowball lasting\nfor a perfect moment, all the while melting away. If we love such moments ferociously, then maybe we can learn to live well -- not in spite of death, but because of it. Let death be what takes us, not lack of imagination. Thank you.

Shivering their timbers, they explain that they’re the former crew \nof the great pirate Greenbeard, who marooned them \nafter they tried to mutiny. Each was bound up in a different \nspot on a small island, until the storm washed them out to sea. In gratitude for saving them, \nthey reveal a secret: the island they were on is also where \nGreenbeard has buried his treasure hoard. But when the sailors try to describe \nthe island, something seems off. All agree it was flat and barren with no \nprominent features except for some trees. Yet each pirate claims they saw \na different number of trees, ranging from two to six. The pirate who saw two trees says the\ntreasure was buried right at his feet. When you fly your hot air balloon \nover the area to investigate, you see hundreds of small islands,\neach with exactly six trees. The next storm will be here soon, so you’ll have to hurry \nand narrow your search. What does the island with Greenbeard’s\ntreasure look like from the sky? And where will the treasure be \non that island? Pause here if you want\nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It might seem like the pirates \nare delirious from dehydration. But that’s not what’s going on. Remember, each was confined \nto a separate point on the island, and no two of them could see \nthe same number of trees. That means that for all but one pirate, \nsomething was blocking their view. And since there are no other \nfeatures on the island, that something could only \nhave been other trees. A pirate would see fewer trees \nwhen two or more fell along a straight line \nfrom their vantage point. So we need to find the island where five different pirates standing \nin different spots would each see a\ndifferent number of trees. Virtually every island has a position \nfrom which you can see six trees. And on most islands there’s a\nposition where 5 trees can be seen by standing in line with two of them. It turns out that the hardest locations\nto find are those with fewer visible trees precisely because they require more trees\nto line up with the viewer’s position. So how can we see just two trees? One way would be if all the trees \nwere lined up in single file, such as on this island. Then, you could stand at the end \nof the line and see one, stand in the middle and see two, or stand anywhere else and see all six. But there’s no place from \nwhich you can see only three, four, or five, so one straight line of trees is out. So what about two lines of trees? So long as the lines aren’t parallel\nand they intersect over land, there’ll always be a position \nwhere the two lines converge from which you could \nsee exactly two trees. And if they’re grouped two and four, or three and three, there are many arrangements in which \nyou could also see three, four, five, and six trees. Fortunately for us, there’s only \none island in the archipelago with two non-parallel lines of trees, and it’ll be buried at the intersection \nof the two lines. You land on this island and dig up a chest\ncontaining a massive pile of tree seeds, ready for planting. Was this treasure really worth \nall that trouble?

Until they develop into toadlets, \nthey can’t survive outside of water, but these ponds are transient \nand quickly evaporate. The tadpoles are \nin a race against the clock to grow up before \ntheir nurseries disappear. So nearly overnight,\nsome of the brood explode in size. They use their jack-o-lantern teeth \nand huge jaw muscles to devour their smaller pond mates. Nourished by this extra fuel, they develop quicker, \nleaving the pond before it can dry out. The spadefoot toad \nis far from the only animal to eat members of its own species \nas a normal part of its life cycle. All of these animals do. If that surprises you, \nyou’re in good company. Until recently, scientists \nthought cannibalism was a rare response to starvation \nor other extreme stress. Well-known cannibals, like the praying mantis\nand black widow spider, were considered bizarre exceptions. But now, we know they more \nor less represent the rule. While it may seem counterproductive for members of the same species \nto eat each other, cannibalism can promote the survival \nof the species as a whole by reducing competition, culling the weak, and bolstering the strong. Some species, like the spadefoot toad, cannibalize in response \nto environmental pressures. Their situation is precarious, but cannibalism for them isn’t \na last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation. Rather, it’s a way to more quickly \noutgrow a stage where they’re especially vulnerable \nto predation or dangerous environmental conditions. Other species, including many fish, indiscriminately cannibalize each other \nduring foraging behavior. Fish produce large numbers of tiny young, and adults exhibit about as much \nindividual recognition of their offspring as humans do for a handful of raisins. Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles \nare easily available, nutrient-rich meals, and with thousands of eggs in a clutch, plenty are still available to hatch \nafter the adults have snacked. Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being \ncannibalized by adults— siblings eat each other too. Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch inside their mother’s oviducts \nat different times. When the hatchlings run out of yolk \nfrom their own eggs, they eat the other eggs and hatchlings until one baby shark\nfrom each oviduct remains. When they emerge, the young sharks \nare well-nourished, experienced predators who stand a better chance of surviving. Even when they aren’t consumed \nfor nutrition, young animals are especially \nvulnerable to cannibalism. Hamsters, rats, and other rodent mothers will eat some of their young\nif they’re sick, dead, or simply too numerous to feed. In other mammals, \nincluding bears and lions, males will kill offspring \nsired by another. That’s because childless females become \nreceptive to mating more quickly than if they were caring for a cub. Rather than waste nutritious meat,\nthe males then eat the dead cubs. Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common \nin birds than in other groups, but certain species will eat diseased\nor dead hatchlings as a way of disposing of the\nbodies before they can attract maggots. When adults eat each other, males are\ncannibalized more often than females, usually during mating \nand generally because they’re smaller. Male Australian redback spiders\nmate with much larger females. Rather than scrambling away after mating, \nthe tiny male does a somersault, bringing his abdomen into contact \nwith his mate’s mouthparts. The female showers him with enzyme-rich \ngut juice and consumes his abdomen. Males not killed in the initial mating \ncrawl back into the fray, often half-eaten, to mate again, after which they’re \ndispatched to the spider pantry. So not only does the male provide \nthe female with his sperm, but he also provides her with \na nutritious meal to better ensure that she’ll\nsurvive to pass on his genes. All in all, it’s clear \nthat cannibalism is as much a part of life \nin the animal kingdom as other, better-recognized behaviors. As we sink our teeth into the evidence \nof cannibalism in nature, we might ask ourselves, what else have we missed by applying\nhuman standards to the natural world?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Until recently, ______ and ______ were thought to be rare examples of cannibalism in the animal kingdom.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sharks and spadefoot toads"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rodents and black widow spiders"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Praying mantises and egg-laying fish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Black widow spiders and praying mantises"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In reproduction-related cannibalism, ______ get eaten most often.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Larger males"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Larger females"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Smaller males"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Smaller females"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Cannibalism in spadefoot toads functions to ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Reduce the large numbers of young that are produced"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ensure that some of the brood will survive unpredictable environmental conditions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reduce competition for limited nutritional resources"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eliminate the surplus of males that are produced"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In fish that produce large numbers of eggs, ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cannibalism is rare"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Parental care prevents most of the eggs from being eaten"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Parents may eat the eggs belonging to other individuals but never their own"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is often no individual recognition of eggs or babies by foraging mothers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Male lions and bears will often cannibalize ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cubs sired by another male"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Other males who are competing with them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Older adults in times of food shortage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their own cubs if they refuse to pick up after themselves"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 28, "lesson": 8, "title": "What are you?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/wUCVOy93", "transcript": {"en": "Are you your body? Well, kind of, right? But is there a line where this stops being true? How much of yourself can you remove, before you stop being you? And does the question even make sense? Your physical existence is cells, trillions of them, at least ten times more than there are stars in the milky way. A cell is a living being, a machine make of up to 50,000 different proteins. It has no consciousness, no will, no purpose; it just is. But it is still an individual. Together, your cells form huge structures for jobs like preparing food, gathering resources, transporting stuff around, scanning the enviroment, and so on. If you extract cells from your body, and put them in the right enviroment, they will continue to stay alive for a while. So, your cells can exist without you, but you can't exist without them. If we take all the cells away, there is no 'you' anymore. Is there a line where a pile of your cells stops being you? For example, if you donate an organ, billions of your cells will continue to live on inside someone else. Does this mean that a part of you became a part of another person? Or is this other body keeping a part of you alive? Or let us imagine an experiment: you and a random person from the street exchange cells. One at a time, your body gets one of their cells, their body gets one of your cells. At which point would they become you? Would they ever? Or is this just a very slow and gross way to teleport you? Let's make this more complicated! The image of ourselves as a static thing is untenable. Almost all of your cells have to die during your lifetime. 250 million have died since the beginning of this video alone. Between one and three million per second. In a seven year period most of your cells are replaced at least once. Everytime you cells set up changes, you are slightly different than before. So, a part of you is dying contantly. If you are lucky enough to become old, you would have cycled through roughly a million billion cells. So what you consider yourself is really just a snapshot. But sometimes, cells are broken and don't want to die, questioning the very nature of the unity of our bodies. We call them cancer. They cancel the biological social contract and become basically immortal. Cancer is not an outside invader; it's a part of you that puts its own survival over yours. But you could also argue that a cancer cell becomes an other entity inside us - another being that just wants to thrive and survive. Can we blame it for that? A chilling cell story, is that of Henrietta Lacks, a young cancer patient who died in 1951. Usually, cells only survived for a few days in the lab, making research very hard. Henrietta's cancer cells were immortal. Over the decades, they were multiplied over and over again and used for countless research projects, saving countless lives. Henrietta's cells are still alive, and overall have been grown to at least 20 tons of biomass. So, there are living parts around the world from someone who has been considered dead for decades. How much of Henrietta is in these cells? What makes one of your cells you, anyway? Maybe the information contained in it: your DNA. Until recently, it was believed that all the cells in your body had basically the same genetic code. But it turns out this is wrong. Your genome is mobile, changing over time through mutations and environmental influences. This is especially the case in your brain. According to recent discoveries, a single neuron in an adult brain has more than one thousand mutations in its genetic code that are not present in the cells surrounding it. But how much you is your DNA really? About 8% of the human genome is made up of viruses that once infected our ancestors and merged with us. Mitochondria, power plants of the cell, once were bacteria, that merged with the ancestors of your cells. They still have their own DNA An average cell has hundreds of them, hundreds of little things that are not really human, but they still kind of are. It is confusing. Let's backtrack a bit. We know that you're made up of trillions of little things, made from more little things, that are constantly changing. Together, all those little things are not static, but dynamic. Their composition and condition is changing constantly. So, we might just be a self-sustaining pattern, without clear borders, that gained self awareness at some point, and now has the ability to think about itself through time and space, but really only exists in this exact very moment. Where did this pattern start? With your conception? When the first human arose? When life first began conquering our small planet? Or when the elements that make up your body were forged in a star? Our human brains evolved to deal with absolutes. The fuzzy borders that make up reality are hard to grasp. Maybe ideas like beginning and end, life and death, you and me, are really not absolutes, but ideas belonging to a fluent pattern, a pattern that is lost in this strange and beautiful universe. The problem of who we are isn't just a question about ourselves, but it is also a question of our minds. Just as our cells can be divided and separated from us, so can our very brains be divided and separated from us - while still in the skull... Click here to go to my channel, and watch the next part.

All the better to hear you with. But my dog Zeke here has floppy ears. Why the difference? Doesn't he need to hear too? Charles Darwin himself actually thought a\nlot about this question. 150 years ago, he published a book that said,\n\"Look—it's not just pet dogs!” Pigs have floppier ears than wild boars. Farmed goats have floppier ears than wild\ngoats. There are floppy-eared rabbits, cows and sheep. And that's not the only weird thing! Tame animals tend to have shorter snouts,\nand their fur tends to be paler or have patches with color missing. All these mysterious traits put together have\nbeen called \"domestication syndrome.\" So, what's going on here? The story starts thousands and thousands of years ago when humans were surrounded by animals. Some animals were scary, and some were a bit more approachable even potentially useful. Our ancestors wanted them to be tamer, so sometimes they tried breeding the friendliest ones. At some point, strange side effects started to show up Thousands of years later, good old Darwin\nnoticed the domestication syndrome pattern, but all he'd learned about change in the animal kingdom couldn't explain this connection between\nbehavior and appearance. Scientists who came after him\ncouldn't figure it out either. But for the past few years, scientists have\nbeen throwing around a fascinating hypothesis. They think the answer to this whole puzzle\nlies in a special group of cells. They're called neural crest cells, and coincidentally, they were discovered by Wilhelm His the exact same year Darwin published his book. Neural crest cells show up very early in the\ndevelopment of all vertebrate embryos. As the embryo grows into a goat or a pig or a wolf, these special cells travel to every corner of the body and take on all sorts of different jobs. Now, here's the thing: Some of these cells\nend up right here above the kidneys. They become cells that secrete adrenaline —that famous fight-or-flight hormone. Wild animals are always fighting or fleeing to survive, and that makes it hard for humans to get close. But what if an animal was born with fewer\nof these neural crest cells, or those cells didn't work so well? That animal would have less adrenaline. It would probably be less freaked out by humans— and it would pass that behavior on to its offspring. The idea is that this is what's going on in\ndomesticated animals. Their neural crest cells have been dialed back. And this would explain all the appearance\nstuff, too because neural crest derived cells do a lot more than just make adrenaline. Some of the cells end up forming parts of the face. Some of them become cells that control the\ncolor of skin and hair. And some make their way into the ears—and\nhelp make cartilage. It's likely this is how dogs first got floppy ears. And then centuries of intentional human breeding\nhelped accentuate or reverse that change. But the neural crest cell hypothesis doesn't\nquite explain every bit of domestication syndrome. Like—what's going on with other tame species\nthat do have upright ears? This be might be the excuse scientists need\nto spend more time with their pets.

Mercer", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-the-handmaid-s-tale-naomi-r-mercer", "transcript": {"en": "In Margaret Atwood's near-future novel,\n\"The Handmaid's Tale,\" a Christian fundamentalist regime\ncalled the Republic of Gilead has staged a military coup\nand established a theocratic government in the United States. The regime theoretically \nrestricts everyone, but in practice a few men have structured\nGilead so they have all the power, especially over women. The Handmaid's Tale is what Atwood calls\nspeculative fiction, meaning it theorizes \nabout possible futures. This is a fundamental characteristic shared by both utopian \nand dystopian texts. The possible futures in Atwood's novels\nare usually negative, or dystopian, where the actions of a small group\nhave destroyed society as we know it. Utopian and dystopian writing\ntends to parallel political trends. Utopian writing frequently depicts\nan idealized society that the author puts forth as a blueprint\nto strive toward. Dystopias, on the other hand, are not necessarily predictions \nof apocalyptic futures, but rather warnings about the ways\nin which societies can set themselves on the path to destruction. The Handmaid's Tale was published in 1985,\nwhen many conservative groups attacked the gains made \nby the second-wave feminist movement. This movement had been advocating greater\nsocial and legal equality for women since the early 1960s. The Handmaid's Tale imagines a future\nin which the conservative counter-movement gains \nthe upper hand and not only demolishes the progress\nwomen had made toward equality, but makes women completely \nsubservient to men. Gilead divides women in the regime\ninto distinct social classes based upon their function\nas status symbols for men. Even their clothing is color-coded. Women are no longer allowed to read or move about freely in public, and fertile women are subject\nto state-engineered rape in order to give birth to children\nfor the regime. Although The Handmaid's Tale\nis set in the future, one of Atwood's self-imposed\nrules in writing it was that she wouldn't use any event or practice that hadn't already \nhappened in human history. The book is set \nin Cambridge, Massachusetts, a city that during \nthe American colonial period had been ruled by the theocratic Puritans. In many ways, the Republic of Gilead\nresembles the strict rules that were present in Puritan society: rigid moral codes, modest clothing, banishment of dissenters, and regulation of every aspect \nof people's lives and relationships. For Atwood, the parallels \nto Massachusett's Puritans were personal as well as theoretical. She spent several years studying\nthe Puritans at Harvard and she's possibly descended from\nMary Webster, a Puritan woman accused\nof witchcraft who survived her hanging. Atwood is a master storyteller. The details of Gilead, \nwhich we've only skimmed the surface of, slowly come into focus through the eyes\nof its characters, mainly the novel's protagonist Offred, a handmaid in the household \nof a commander. Before the coup that established Gilead, Offred had a husband, a child, a job,\nand a normal, middle-class American life. But when the fundamentalist regime\ncomes into power, Offred is denied her identity, separated from her family, and reduced to being, in Offred's words, \"a two-legged womb for increasing \nGilead's waning population.\" She initially accepts the loss \nof her fundamental human rights in the name of stabilizing \nthe new government. But state control soon extends\ninto attempts to control the language, behavior, and thoughts of herself\nand other individuals. Early on, Offred says, \"I wait. I compose myself. My self is a thing I must compose, \nas one composes a speech.\" She likens language \nto the formulation of identity. Her words also acknowledge \nthe possibility of resistance, and it's resistance, the actions of people\nwho dare to break the political, intellectual, and sexual rules, that drives the plot \nof the Handmaid's Tale. Ultimately, the novel's exploration\nof the consequences of complacency, and how power can be wielded unfairly, makes Atwood's chilling vision\nof a dystopian regime ever relevant."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Utopias generally represent what kind of societies?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oppressive"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ideal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Realistic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Destructive"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The novel’s setting of Cambridge, Massachusetts draws a parallel to the theocracy established by the Puritans during colonial times.

I'm not a doctor; I'm a chef, I don't have expensive equipment or medicine. I use information, education. I profoundly believe\nthat the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life. We have an awful, awful reality right now. America, you're at the top of your game. This is one of the most unhealthy\ncountries in the world. Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have\nchildren in this room today? Put your hands up. You can continue to put your hands up,\naunties and uncles as well. Most of you. OK. We, the adults of the last\nfour generations, have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan\nthan their own parents. Your child will live a life\nten years younger than you because of the landscape of food\nthat we've built around them. Two-thirds of this room, today, in America, are statistically\noverweight or obese. You lot, you're all right, but we'll get you eventually, don't worry. (Laughter) The statistics of bad health are clear, very clear. We spend our lives being paranoid\nabout death, murder, homicide, you name it; it's on the front page\nof every paper, CNN. Look at homicide\nat the bottom, for God's sake. Right? (Laughter) (Applause) Every single one of those in the red\nis a diet-related disease. Any doctor, any specialist\nwill tell you that. Fact: diet-related disease\nis the biggest killer in the United States,\nright now, here today. This is a global problem. It's a catastrophe. It's sweeping the world. England is right behind you, as usual. (Laughter) I know they were close,\nbut not that close. We need a revolution. Mexico, Australia, Germany, India, China, all have massive problems\nof obesity and bad health. Think about smoking. It costs way less than obesity now. Obesity costs you Americans\n10 percent of your health-care bills, 150 billion dollars a year. In 10 years, it's set to double: 300 billion dollars a year. Let's be honest, guys,\nyou haven't got that cash. (Laughter) I came here to start a food revolution\nthat I so profoundly believe in. We need it. The time is now. We're in a tipping-point moment. I've been doing this for seven years. I've been trying in America\nfor seven years. Now is the time when it's ripe --\nripe for the picking. I went to the eye of the storm. I went to West Virginia,\nthe most unhealthy state in America. Or it was last year. We've got a new one this year,\nbut we'll work on that next season. (Laughter) Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town. I wanted to put heart and soul and people, your public, around the statistics\nthat we've become so used to. I want to introduce you\nto some of the people that I care about: your public, your children. I want to show a picture\nof my friend Brittany. She's 16 years old. She's got six years to live because of the food that she's eaten. She's the third generation of Americans that hasn't grown up\nwithin a food environment where they've been taught\nto cook at home or in school, or her mom, or her mom's mom. She has six years to live. She's eating her liver to death. Stacy, the Edwards family. This is a normal family, guys. Stacy does her best,\nbut she's third-generation as well; she was never taught to cook\nat home or at school. The family's obese. Justin here, 12 years old,\nhe's 350 pounds. He gets bullied, for God's sake. The daughter there, Katie,\nshe's four years old. She's obese before she even gets\nto primary school. Marissa, she's all right,\nshe's one of your lot. But you know what? Her father, who was obese,\ndied in her arms, And then the second\nmost important man in her life, her uncle, died of obesity, and now her step-dad is obese. You see, the thing is, obesity and diet-related disease doesn't just hurt the people that have it; it's all of their friends, families,\nbrothers, sisters. Pastor Steve: an inspirational man, one of my early allies\nin Huntington, West Virginia. He's at the sharp knife-edge\nof this problem. He has to bury the people, OK? And he's fed up with it. He's fed up with burying his friends,\nhis family, his community. Come winter, three times\nas many people die. He's sick of it. This is preventable disease.\nWaste of life. By the way, this is\nwhat they get buried in. We're not geared up to do this. Can't even get them out the door,\nand I'm being serious. Can't even get them there. Forklift. OK, I see it as a triangle, OK? This is our landscape of food. I need you to understand it. You've probably heard all this before. Over the last 30 years, what's happened that's ripped\nthe heart out of this country? Let's be frank and honest. Well, modern-day life. Let's start with the Main Street. Fast food has taken over\nthe whole country; we know that. The big brands are\nsome of the most important powers, powerful powers, in this country. (Sighs) Supermarkets as well. Big companies. Big companies. Thirty years ago, most of the food was largely local and largely fresh. Now it's largely processed\nand full of all sorts of additives, extra ingredients,\nand you know the rest of the story. Portion size is obviously\na massive, massive problem. Labeling is a massive problem. The labeling in this country\nis a disgrace. The industry wants\nto self-police themselves. What, in this kind of climate?\nThey don't deserve it. How can you say something is low-fat\nwhen it's full of so much sugar? Home. The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart\nof passing on food culture, what made our society. That is not happening anymore. And you know, as we go\nto work and as life changes, and as life always evolves, we kind of have\nto look at it holistically -- step back for a moment,\nand re-address the balance. It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK? I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now;\nthe Edwards family. (Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk. This stuff goes through you\nand your family's body every week. And I need you to know that this is going to kill\nyour children early. How are you feeling? Stacy: Just feeling really sad\nand depressed right now. But, you know, I want\nmy kids to succeed in life and this isn't going to get them there. But I'm killing them. JO: Yes you are. You are. But we can stop that. Normal. Let's get on schools, something that I'm fairly much\na specialist in. OK, school. What is school? Who invented it?\nWhat's the purpose of school? School was always invented\nto arm us with the tools to make us creative, do wonderful things, make us earn a living, etc., etc. You know, it's been kind of in this sort\nof tight box for a long, long time, OK? But we haven't really evolved it to deal with the health\ncatastrophes of America, OK? School food is something that most kids --\n31 million a day, actually -- have twice a day, more than often,\nbreakfast and lunch, 180 days of the year. So you could say that school\nfood is quite important, really, judging the circumstances. (Laughter) Before I crack into my rant, which I'm sure you're waiting for -- (Laughter) I need to say one thing,\nand it's so important in, hopefully, the magic\nthat happens and unfolds in the next three months. The lunch ladies,\nthe lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador. I'm not slagging them off. They're doing the best they can do. They're doing their best. But they're doing what they're told, and what they're being\ntold to do is wrong. The system is highly run by accountants; there's not enough, or any,\nfood-knowledgeable people in the business. There's a problem: If you're not a food expert,\nand you've got tight budgets and it's getting tighter,\nthen you can't be creative, you can't duck and dive\nand write different things around things. If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker, the only thing you can do\nin these circumstances is buy cheaper shit. Now, the reality is, the food that your kids get\nevery day is fast food, it's highly processed, there's not enough\nfresh food in there at all. You know, the amount\nof additives, E numbers, ingredients you wouldn't believe -- there's not enough veggies at all. French fries are considered a vegetable. Pizza for breakfast.\nThey don't even get crockery. Knives and forks?\nNo, they're too dangerous. They have scissors in the classroom, but knives and forks? No. And the way I look at it is: If you don't have knives\nand forks in your school, you're purely endorsing, from a state level, fast food,\nbecause it's handheld. And yes, by the way, it is fast food: It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers, it's wieners, it's pizzas,\nit's all of that stuff. (Sighs) Ten percent of what we spend\non health care, as I said earlier, is on obesity, and it's going to double. We're not teaching our kids. There's no statutory right\nto teach kids about food, elementary or secondary school, OK? We don't teach kids about food, right? And this is a little clip\nfrom an elementary school, which is very common in England. (Video) Who knows what this is? Child: Potatoes. Jamie Oliver: Potato?\nSo, you think these are potatoes? Do you know what that is? Do you know what that is? Child: Broccoli? JO: What about this? Our good old friend. Child: Celery. JO: No. What do you think this is? Child: Onion.\nJO: Onion? No. JO: Immediately you\nget a really clear sense of \"Do the kids know anything\nabout where food comes from?\" Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear? JO: What do you think this is?\nChild: I don't know. JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is, then they will never eat it. (Laughter) JO: Normal. England and America, England and America. Guess what fixed that. Two one-hour sessions. We've got to start teaching our kids\nabout food in schools, period. (Applause) I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble\nthat we're in, guys, OK? I want to talk about something\nso basic as milk. Every kid has the right to milk at school. Your kids will be having milk\nat school, breakfast and lunch, right? They'll be having two bottles, OK? And most kids do. But milk ain't good enough anymore. Don't get me wrong, I support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money\nfor some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings, colorings and sugar in milk, more kids will drink it. Yeah. Obviously now that's going to catch on the apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples\nthey'll eat more as well. Do you know what I mean? For me, there isn't any need\nto flavor the milk. Okay? There's sugar in everything. I know the ins and outs\nof those ingredients. It's in everything. Even the milk hasn't escaped\nthe kind of modern-day problems. There's our milk. There's our carton. In that is nearly as much sugar\nas one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop, and they are having two a day. So, let me just show you. We've got one kid, here -- having, you know,\neight tablespoons of sugar a day. You know, there's your week. There's your month. And I've taken the liberty of putting in just the five years\nof elementary school sugar, just from milk. Now, I don't know about you guys, but judging the circumstances, right, any judge in the whole world, would look at the statistics\nand the evidence, and they would find any government\nof old guilty of child abuse. That's my belief. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, if I came up here, and I wish\nI could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer, you'd be fighting\nand scrambling to get to me. This, all this bad news, is preventable. That's the good news. It's very, very preventable. So, let's just think about,\nwe got a problem here, we need to reboot. Okay so, in my world,\nwhat do we need to do? Here is the thing, right, it cannot just come from one source. To reboot and make real tangible change, real change, so that I could look you\nin the white of the eyes and say, \"In 10 years' time, the history of your children's lives, happiness -- and let's not forget,\nyou're clever if you eat well, you know you're going to live longer -- all of that stuff,\nit will look different. OK?\" So, supermarkets. Where else do you shop so religiously? Week in, week out. How much money do you spend,\nin your life, in a supermarket? Love them. They just sell us what we want. All right. They owe us to put a food ambassador\nin every major supermarket. They need to help us shop. They need to show us how to cook\nquick, tasty, seasonal meals for people that are busy. This is not expensive. It is done in some, and it needs\nto be done across the board in America soon, and quick. The big brands, you know, the food brands, need to put food education\nat the heart of their businesses. I know, easier said than done. It's the future. It's the only way. Fast food. With the fast-food industry you know, it's very competitive. I've had loads\nof secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants. I know how they do it. I mean, basically they've weaned us on to these hits of sugar,\nsalt and fat, and x, y, and z, and everyone loves them, right? So, these guys are going\nto be part of the solution. But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors\nand the restaurant industry, and over a five, six, seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat, sugar and all the other\nnon-food ingredients. Now, also, back to the sort of big brands: labeling, I said earlier,\nis an absolute farce and has got to be sorted. OK, school. Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year, from that little precious age of four, until 18, 20, 24, whatever, they need to be cooked proper, fresh food from local growers on site, OK? There needs to be a new\nstandard of fresh, proper food for your children, yeah? (Applause) Under the circumstances,\nit's profoundly important that every single\nAmerican child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life. Life skills. (Applause) That means that they can be\nstudents, young parents, and be able to sort of duck and dive\naround the basics of cooking, no matter what recession hits\nthem next time. If you can cook,\nrecession money doesn't matter. If you can cook, time doesn't matter. The workplace, we haven't\nreally talked about it. You know, it's now time\nfor corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed\nor make available to their staff. The staff are the moms and dads\nof America's children. Marissa, her father died in her hand, I think she'd be quite happy if corporate America could start\nfeeding their staff properly. Definitely they shouldn't be left out. Let's go back to the home. Now, look, if we do\nall this stuff, and we can, it's so achievable. You can care and be commercial. Absolutely. But the home needs to start passing on\ncooking again, for sure. For sure, pass it on as a philosophy. And for me, it's quite romantic, but it's about if one person\nteaches three people how to cook something, and they teach three of their mates, that only has to repeat itself 25 times, and that's the whole\npopulation of America. Romantic, yes, but most importantly, it's about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts\nmakes a difference. We've got to put back what's been lost. Huntington's Kitchen. Huntington, where I made this program, we've got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people\nto really get on this change. I truly believe that change will happen. Huntington's Kitchen.\nI work with a community. I worked in the schools. I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area\nfrom the junk, onto the fresh food: six-and-a-half grand per school. (Applause) That's all it takes,\nsix-and-a-half grand per school. The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay? This can do 5,000 people a year, which is 10 percent of their population, and it's people on people. You know, it's local cooks\nteaching local people. It's free cooking lessons,\nguys, in the Main Street. This is real, tangible change,\nreal, tangible change. Around America, if we just look back now, there is plenty of wonderful\nthings going on. There is plenty of beautiful\nthings going on. There are angels\naround America doing great things in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups, garden set-ups, education -- there are amazing people\ndoing this already. The problem is they all want to roll out what they're doing to the next school, but there's no cash. We need to recognize the experts\nand the angels quickly, identify them, and allow them\nto easily find the resource to keep rolling out\nwhat they're already doing, and doing well. Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things\nthat she wants to do. (Applause) And look, I know it's weird having an English person\nstanding here before you talking about all this. All I can say is: I care. I'm a father, and I love this country. And I believe truly, actually, that if change can be made\nin this country, beautiful things will happen\naround the world. If America does it,\nother people will follow. It's incredibly important. (Audience) Yeah! (Applause) When I was in Huntington, trying to get a few things to work\nwhen they weren't, I thought \"If I had a magic wand,\nwhat would I do?\" And I thought, \"You know what? I'd just love to be put in front\nof some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America.\" And a month later, TED phoned me up\nand gave me this award. I'm here. So, my wish. Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow. My wish is for you to help a strong,\nsustainable movement to educate every child about food, to inspire families to cook again, and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity. (Applause) Thank you.

As inconvenient and even downright \ndangerous as this process sounds, it’s actually quite common. Butterflies are just a few of \nthe 800,000 insect species that transition from larvae to adults \nthrough complete metamorphosis. That’s approximately 85% of insects \nand 70% of all known animal species. But how exactly does \na caterpillar become a butterfly? When a caterpillar hatches \nfrom an egg, it has none of a butterfly’s \nphysical traits. It does have groups of cells\ninside its body called imaginal discs that will eventually \nbecome its butterfly parts. For now, these cells remain dormant. Juvenile hormone suppresses \ntheir activity, and prevents the caterpillar\nfrom beginning metamorphosis too early. Immediately after hatching,\nthe caterpillar begins to feed, building up fat until its rigid skin,\ncalled a cuticle, becomes too tight. At this point, a hormone called ecdysone \ntriggers the cuticle to shed, or molt. As the caterpillar grows, \nit usually molts four times. Then, when it’s nice and plump, the caterpillar’s levels \nof juvenile hormone drop, which triggers it to stop\neating and moving. A final burst of ecdysone prompts the caterpillar’s cells \nto begin to self-destruct. Soon, the muscles, fat, and other tissues \nare almost entirely liquefied, though the imaginal discs stay intact\nand begin to grow. At the same time, a second skin layer \ncalled the pupal cuticle forms underneath the first. One more molt exposes \nthe hard exterior of the pupa. Besides the imaginal discs, \nonly a few tissues are spared, including parts of the respiratory system, the heart, some abdominal muscles, and the mushroom bodies of the brain. The caterpillar juice then fuels \nthe development of the imaginal discs into eyes, antennae, legs, wings, genitalia, and other body parts. Once its new body is built, \nthe insect molts one last time, shedding the pupal cuticle. From there, it’s free to fly away \na new butterfly. Even after such a dramatic transformation, the butterfly does retain some memories \nfrom its caterpillar days. It’s likely the mushroom bodies \nof the brain carry important knowledge from the\ncaterpillar over to the adult butterfly. How did such an involved developmental \nprocess come to be? We don’t know for sure. The leading theory is that the caterpillar\nis actually a drawn-out version of a life stage that takes place \ninside the egg for some other insects. According to this hypothesis,\nover millions of years, the larvae evolved the ability\nto eat and live outside the egg. Regardless of how complete \nmetamorphosis originated, it’s become part of the life cycles of\na dizzying number of insect species. Still, plenty of species get along \nperfectly well with a simpler developmental process. What survival advantages might \ncomplete metamorphosis provide to make up for the added hassle? For one, it keeps larvae and adults from competing for the same habitats\nand food sources. And while the pupa may seem vulnerable, this immobile stage \ncan actually be a good way to pass parts of the year \nwhen food is scarce. To us, a butterfly’s metamorphosis \nmight sound as fantastic as a phoenix rising from its ashes. But these transformations are taking place\nall around us, all the time. From the Hercules beetle to the honey bee to the garden ant, countless squishy larvae dissolve \nand emerge as armored, aerodynamic, \nand nimble adults."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which is the correct sequence of life stages in a butterfly’s life cycle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egg – pupa – caterpillar – adult butterfly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Egg – caterpillar – pupa – adult butterfly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pupa – egg – caterpillar – adult butterfly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Caterpillar – egg – pupa -- adult butterfly"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Eighty-five percent of all insect species undergo complete metamorphosis.

So today we're in the rocket van and I've got two little science helpers here right? Kids: Yes, right. Are you wearing your seatbelts? Yes. OK we're gonna do something pretty interesting. Check this out. I've got a pendulum suspended from the top of our family van and we're just gonna drive forward, we're gonna accelerate, so if we're going that way, which direction do you think this pendulum should go? What do you think? 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. Kids: Yes. Which way is it going? Kids: My way. That's right. It's because I'm accelerating right? Does that make sense to you guys? Yes sir. OK very good, I was hoping it would make sense. So we're gonna change it up just a little bit. OK so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna replace this pendulum with a balloon. We should see the same thing right? Let me cut this off. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna accelerate that way so we have the mass of the balloon and the acceleration that should net in a force and will have to react with this string right? You guys ready? Yes sir. 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. Wait a second. What just happened? What happens when I stop? The balloon goes backwards when I stop. What's happening? 3.. 2.. 1..Go. There it is. It's coming right at me. Why's it doing that? Do you wanna know? Yeah. Alright, I brought something to show you. You remember I told you I was gonna bring this jar earlier? Remember that? So it's like this. Imagine this entire van is just like this jar, and all the air inside this van is just like the water in the jar. Does that make sense? So let's imagine that the balloon is this bubble on top, because the helium in the balloon is lighter than air right? So that causes it to do what? Kids: Go up. Go up, that's right. So if I've got this air that's just like it, what happens if I move the jar that way? All that water sloshes to the back. And when that water sloshes back this way, which direction does the bubble go? You see that? So the air bubble moves in the direction of acceleration, does that make sense? I know you're five but I think you can get this. OK so I've got my seatbelt on. If I drive forward real fast right now which direction is the balloon gonna go? Forward. Why will it go forward? Because all the air's sloshing back. That's right! Very good! Watch this. Look at that. You see that? So you know what that means don't you? That means you have more air to breathe than daddy does when I'm going fast. Did you realise that? Kids: Nooo! Yeah that means when I go fast, that means more air sloshes back there to you and you have more oxygen to breathe. Doesn't it feel good back there? OK so now we have the plumb bob right next to the balloon, so if I go forward they should spread apart right? Let's check it out. Is it working? Kids: Yeah. So what I want to do is I want to tell everybody on Smarter Every Day that if they go download a free audio book that it'll help Smarter Every Day by sponsoring us. Audible will, if they go to audible.com/smarter. And so they get a free audio book, but I'm gonna do it in a funny way. Now lean in towards me and look straight at the camera. I know you don't know what I'm gonna do but don't laugh because I want people to realize that they can send you to school if they get a audio book. Does that make sense? Yeah. So whatever happens don't laugh. OK? Look straight at the camera. Ready? You don't know what I'm doing, do you? OK you ready? (High pitched helium voice) Thank you for supporting Smarter Every Day and if you would please download an audio book at audible.com/smarter. Did you know daddy could talk like this? No. You didn't know that happened, did you? So if you go get a free audio book it'll support Smarter Every Day and it'll help me send these kids to school. Does that sound like a good idea? Yes. You should never do that, by the way. That's only for adults. How'd you do that? It's magical. Anyway I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Please subscribe to Smarter Every Day and support our sponsor audible, I'll leave a link somewhere and you can check it out. Thanks, bye. How'd you change your voice? OK now we have the sunroof, the side window and the back open. I'm gonna go forward, where do you think it's gonna go? Daughter: Forward. Son: Backwards. 3.. 2.. 1.. Dad: So this is air, not helium? Yes sir. OK I think it's gonna act like the pendulum. Dad: 3.. 2.. 1.. Go. (laughs) Backwards. Oh it does.

Meyer", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-seven-planets-riddle-edwin-f-meyer", "transcript": {"en": "Your interstellar police squad\nhas tracked a group of dangerous rebels to a cluster of of seven small planets. Now you must apprehend them quickly \nbefore their reinforcements arrive. Of course, the rebels won’t just stay put. They’ll try to dodge you\nby moving from planet to planet. But you have one major advantage. Every hour, your state-of-the-art cruiser \ncan warp between any two planets, while their beat-up smuggling ship can only jump to an adjacent planet \nin that same time. These rebels don’t like to stay put. Every time they can relocate, they will. Your scouts tell you that the approaching\nrebel fleet is 10 hours away. You can’t risk letting the rebels escape. Can you devise a sequence \nfor searching the planets that’s guaranteed to catch them \nin 10 warps or less, no matter what moves they make? Rounding up the rebels won’t be easy. For one, you have no way of knowing which \nplanet they’re on to begin with. And without that information, it’s hard \nto determine where they’ll move next. So where do you begin? When tackling problems of this kind \nit often helps to simplify things, so you can better understand \ntheir dynamics. Let’s imagine that this cluster \nhas the same arrangement but no outermost planets,\nleaving only the four in the center. We still don’t know which planet \nthe rebels start on. But there’s one key feature: the third planet \nis adjacent to all others, which means the rebels either start there \nand move somewhere else, or start on one of the other planets and have no choice \nbut to move to planet three. Simply checking planet three\ntwice in a row would do the trick. Adding the three outer planet \nadds a bit more complexity, but the same strategy remains. We want to check the planets in an order \nthat will eventually corner the rebels. And there’s another insight \nthat can help us: each hour, the rebels move from \nan even-numbered planet to an odd-numbered planet, or vice versa. This gives us a way \nto simplify the problem by dividing the planets into two subsets, and tackling each one separately. For starters, let’s assume the rebels \nbegin on an even-numbered planet: either two, four, or six. So we’ll search planet two first. If they’re not there, they must have \nstarted on either four or six. which means they can move to three, five, or seven. Planet three at the center gives them \nthe most options for their next move, so we’ll want to check there next. If we don’t find them, they must have been\nat planet five or seven, meaning they’ll next move to four or six. Let’s now search planet four. If they’re not there, they must have gone \nto the sixth planet and can only flee to three or seven. If we next scour planet three \nand don’t find them, we know they went to planet seven \nand are now cornered. They can only move to planet six, where\nwe’ll apprehend them on our fifth search. Of course, this plan only works assuming that the rebels were on \nan even-numbered planet in the first hour. But what if that assumption was wrong? In that case, they must’ve started \non an odd-numbered planet. And because they move to an adjacent \nplanet every hour, their location must alternate between\nodd and even-numbered planets. This means that if they were on \nan odd-numbered planet to start, after five moves, they'd be \non an even-numbered planet. So if our first five searches missed them because our assumption that they started \non an even-numbered planet was wrong, all we have to do now \nis repeat the sequence!

palms maybe butterflies in her belly is it an aha moment whatever it is it's an I have something to say moment who's out there in the audience though will she make them laugh will she make them think what about the millions that might be watching online who will hear her words as a call to action whatever it is that's on our mind mrs. and I have something to say moment you guys have had these before right the sense of urgency it's full of a need a physical need to say that thing right now this moment the moment in which a human shares her or his idea with another person or other people has been happening since we've had words to express ideas I think it's one of the most important moments that happens in our human development in this moment we can shut down or we can speak up we can be shut down or we can be asked to speak up so that others in the room can hear we can be ignored or we can be heard what happens to us in these moments what we do with them how they're received whether or not they're encouraged determines so much about how we engage with the rest of the world about how we decide to act the next time we have one of these moments so the history of the origin of human language is a talk for a different day and incidentally it is something it is a very very deep rabbit hole to get into when you're procrastinating on something else that you should be doing despite lots of competing efforts theories as to how and when we started doing this it does seem like we humans have been communicating as a tool to advance humanity and as a measurement of our progress as a species human connection the ability to communicate to warn each other to ask questions to use our collective voice it's what saves us from danger it's what solves problems it's what makes us human as humans we've developed a lot of tools to kind of help us along the way in terms of of giving potential power to this moment we've created a lot of things the first alphabet the first book the first telegram the first telephone it's a sexy one the first radio the first TV this is where things start to speed up a little bit the first VCR the internet the first social network and the first smart phone that's right each of these inventions helped a human's voice go farther and faster than it ever had before but with the advent of each of these tools we see a pattern at first they're available to who to the wealthy to the powerful right the people who are able to communicate who are able to share their ideas were the philosophers the inventors the military guys in suits eventually though over a long period of time each of these tools makes communication more accessible here's the crazy thing about our modern world though the internet and I say this carefully because I realized that we have a lot of debilitating accessibility issues that we still need to work through but the internet and the things that go along with it social networks and smartphones are making communication more accessible than it ever has been before this is an especially big deal because unlike the VCR or the TV or even radio these new technologies allow you you not just the rich and the powerful but you to connect to the world outside of right here beyond the walls of your bedroom beyond your in unprecedented ways today all you need to get to get a voice out there is one glowing rectangle and some bandwidth this means that you no longer have to be part of some elite class to share your ideas with the world right thanks to smartphones and YouTube you can be this 10 year old kid sitting in his mom's after basketball practice Nyame is one example that says a lot about why we might be smarter as a society to get out of the way and invest more time in young people sharing their thoughts and ideas there are lots of other reasons for this really it just makes good sense you all are the ones that have the biggest the largest amount of time left to solve the big problems that we have not really been able to make too much of a dent in also you're naturally better equipped than we are to solve these problems you all are the first native speakers of this digital language you're the ones who are experts at Twitter and snapchat and whatever that new thing is that's probably come out during the time that I've been speaking that you've already mastered I think Celia over there probably already has 12 viral snap twit chats whatever the new thing is gonna be called already experts at it this is something that is additionally important because you all don't see things that can't be done you see things you haven't done yet you naturally question what we old consider to be the status quo because quite frankly your status hasn't been quote yet like to me this is the box that my Vitamix came in I don't I don't have a Vitamix I don't know why I said that to me this is a box to a seven-year-old it's a lab for doing experiments or a sweet plane to practice your upside down flight loops in or something that can take you all the way to Pluto because when you're seven you don't judge Pluto for having its planetary status downgraded you think sweet Pluto I am totally going there you'll pick the uncomfortable fight that we tiptoe around every day you'll name the elephant in the room because there's a freaking elephant in the room okay so this is these are the reasons that I think that you all are better equipped to handle these problems than we are so y'all got this all right Celia you're in charge no I'm kidding I'm kidding but this is the kind of thing that we actually do right we say that youth voice is important but that's a lot different than really giving it space to flourish it's a lot different than actually listening so I did a lot of prep as any expert would for this talk but what struck me was that I what I probably should do is get out of the way work to create some space for young people to share their ideas and then step aside which is exactly what my program there are over two billion school-aged individuals living in the world today that's more young people than any other time in human history and it's this generations creativity their actions their art their poetry their protests their questions their code their dreams it's this generations ideas that will define the future of our world one well articulated idea can reach and inspire millions that's why Ted's youth and education initiative Ted ed has created a program that's dedicated to sparking and celebrating the best ideas of young people around the world it was to create more confident individuals it was Eric lebas was won by us for the program is called ted-ed clubs it supports students in identifying their passions learning public speaking skills connecting with a global network of classrooms and sharing student ideas in the form of short TED style talks here's how it works participating students and teachers gain access to a free and flexible curriculum they can use to start a TED ed Club at their school each suggested meeting uses TED Talks to help students engage in critical thinking exercises and gain invaluable presentation skills in the final meeting students are invited to give their own TED talk and if they record their talk they can upload it to Ted Ed's award-winning platform where it can be referenced on a resume a college application and shared with participating clubs around the world over two billion young people empowered and encouraged to share their ideas imagine that future and bring TED ed clubs to your community today we are not the only organization that is trying to amplify youth voices FIRST Robotics inspires young people to become leaders in science and technology by having them design and build and program robots that solve real-world engineering challenges the YMCA Youth in government program encourages young people to take over state and national governments by researching debating and voting on policy issues that they care about for their own governments not that there's anything wrong with the way that my country or yours has been handling our governments lately the Stanford design schools project Wayfarer focuses on helping teens discover and navigate a path for their future for your future based on your unique qualities rather than some prepackaged school subjects each of these efforts have same fundamental assumption you have something uniquely valuable to say right now not in some distant future time when all of a sudden you go from becoming the leaders of tomorrow to right now leaders so what kinds of things do we talk about what kinds of things are on your mind well society like feeds off of insecurity and I think everyone should learn to like your peers and they know your bullying stress body image have been viewed on our platform over a million times these students are leaders right now in today's world everywhere you go is a potential stage your kitchen your mom's front seat your classroom and many of you are carrying a device in your pocket that will carry your thoughts your dreams your voice across the world you can connect to other cultures and perspectives you can brainstorm and collaborate in ways that I will never be able to understand because I don't get snapchat filters and I never will most importantly though you're all carrying a story that is uniquely yours it is your something to say just like this young girl has her something to say right on the tip of her tongue this moment frozen in time represents you and the millions of young people just like you and also not at all like you who will have thoughts ideas questions and curiosities and if you're brave enough to say it to share it it can travel farther and do more good now than any other time in history so I'm gonna get off the stage now because it's your turn what do you want to do with it thank you [Applause]"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "There are all over ______

{"page": 28, "lesson": 17, "title": "Jimmy Carter: Why I believe the mistreatment of women is the number one human rights abuse", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/5nKQXf5J", "transcript": {"en": "As a matter of fact, I was trying to think about my career\nsince I left the White House, and the best example I have is a cartoon\nin The New Yorker a couple of years ago. This little boy is looking up\nat his father, and he says, \"Daddy, when I grow up,\nI want to be a former president.\" (Laughter) Well, I have had a great blessing\nas a former president, because I have had an access that very few other people\nin the world have ever had to get to know so many people\naround this whole universe. Not only am I familiar\nwith the 50 states in the United States, but also my wife and I have visited\nmore than 145 countries in the world, and the Carter Center has had full-time\nprograms in 80 nations on Earth. And a lot of times,\nwhen we go into a country, we not only the meet\nthe king or the president, but we also meet the villagers who live\nin the most remote areas of Africa. So our overall commitment\nat the Carter Center is to promote human rights, and knowing the world as I do,\nI can tell you without any equivocation that the number one abuse\nof human rights on Earth is, strangely, not addressed quite often,\nis the abuse of women and girls. (Applause) There are a couple of reasons for this\nthat I'll mention to begin with. First of all is the misinterpretation\nof religious scriptures, holy scriptures, in the Bible, Old Testament,\nNew Testament, Quran and so forth, and these have been misinterpreted by men\nwho are now in the ascendant positions in the synagogues and the churches\nand in the mosques. And they interpret these rules\nto make sure that women are ordinarily relegated\nto a secondary position compared to men in the eyes of God. This is a very serious problem.\nIt's ordinarily not addressed. A number of years ago, in the year 2000, I had been a Baptist,\na Southern Baptist for 70 years -- I tell you, I still teach\nSunday school every Sunday; I'll be teaching this Sunday as well -- but the Southern Baptist Convention\nin the year 2000 decided that women should play\na secondary position, a subservient position to men. So they issued an edict, in effect, that prevents women from being priests,\npastors, deacons in the church, or chaplains in the military, and if a woman teaches a classroom in a Southern Baptist seminary, they cannot teach if a boy is in the room, because you can find verses in the Bible, there's over 30,000 verses in the Bible, that say that a woman shouldn't\nteach a man, and so forth. But the basic thing is the scriptures\nare misinterpreted to keep men in an ascendant position. That is an all-pervasive problem, because men can exert that power and if an abusive husband or an employer,\nfor instance, wants to cheat women, they can say that if women\nare not equal in the eyes of God, why should I treat them as equals myself? Why should I pay them equal pay\nfor doing the same kind of work? The other very serious blight that causes this problem\nis the excessive resort to violence, and that is increasing\ntremendously around the world. In the United States of America,\nfor instance, we have had an enormous increase\nin abuse of poor people, mostly black people and minorities,\nby putting them in prison. When I was in office\nas governor of Georgia, one out of every 1,000 Americans\nwere in prison. Nowadays, 7.3 people\nper 1,000 are in prison. That's a sevenfold increase. And since I left the White House, there's been an 800 percent increase\nin the number of women who are black who are in prison. We also have\n[one of the only countries] on Earth that still has the death penalty\nthat is a developed country. And we rank right alongside\nthe countries that are most abusive in all elements of human rights\nin encouraging the death penalty. We're in California now,\nand I figured out the other day that California has spent\nfour billion dollars in convicting 13 people\nfor the death penalty. If you add that up, that's 307 million\ndollars it costs California to send a person to be executed. Nebraska this week just passed a law\nabolishing the death penalty, because it costs so much. (Applause) So the resort to violence and abuse\nof poor people and helpless people is another cause of the increase\nin abuse of women. Let me just go down a very few\nabuses of women that concern me most, and I'll be fairly brief, because I have\na limited amount of time, as you know. One is genital mutilation. Genital mutilation is horrible\nand not known by American women, but in some countries, many countries, when a child is born that's a girl,\nvery soon in her life, her genitals are completely cut away\nby a so-called cutter who has a razor blade and,\nin a non-sterilized way, they remove the exterior parts\nof a woman's genitalia. And sometimes, in more extreme cases\nbut not very rare cases, they sew the orifice up so the girl\ncan just urinate or menstruate. And then later, when she gets married,\nthe same cutter goes in and opens the orifice up\nso she can have sex. This is not a rare thing, although\nit's against the law in most countries. In Egypt, for instance, 91 percent of all the females\nthat live in Egypt today have been sexually mutilated in that way. In some countries,\nit's more than 98 percent of the women are cut that way\nbefore they reach maturity. This is a horrible affliction on all women that live in those countries. Another very serious thing\nis honor killings, where a family with misinterpretation,\nagain, of a holy scripture -- there's nothing in the Quran\nthat mandates this -- will execute a girl in their family if she is raped or if she marries a man\nthat her father does not approve, or sometimes even if she\nwears inappropriate clothing. And this is done by members\nof her own family, so the family becomes murderers when the girl brings\nso-called disgrace to the family. An analysis was done in Egypt\nnot so long ago by the United Nations and it showed that 75 percent\nof these murders of a girl are perpetrated by the father,\nthe uncle or the brother, but 25 percent of the murders\nare conducted by women. Another problem that we have in the world that relates to women\nparticularly is slavery, or human trafficking it's called nowadays. There were about 12.5 million people\nsold from Africa into slavery in the New World back in\nthe 19th century and the 18th century. There are 30 million people\nnow living in slavery. The United States Department of State\nnow has a mandate from Congress to give a report every year, and the State Department reports\nthat 800,000 people are sold across international borders\nevery year into slavery, and that 80 percent\nof those sold are women, into sexual slavery. In the United States right this moment, 60,000 people are living\nin human bondage, or slavery. Atlanta, Georgia, where\nthe Carter Center is located and where I teach at Emory University, they have between 200 and 300 women,\npeople sold into slavery every month. It's the number one place\nin the nation because of that. Atlanta has the busiest\nairport in the world, and they also have a lot of passengers\nthat come from the Southern Hemisphere. If a brothel owner wants to buy a girl\nthat has brown or black skin, they can do it for 1,000 dollars. A white-skinned girl brings\nseveral times more than that, and the average brothel owner in Atlanta\nand in the United States now can earn about $35,000 per slave. The sex trade in Atlanta, Georgia, exceeds\nthe total drug trade in Atlanta, Georgia. So this is another very serious problem,\nand the basic problem is prostitution, because there's not\na whorehouse in America that's not known by the local officials, the local policemen, or the chief\nof police or the mayor and so forth. And this leads to one\nof the worst problems, and that is that women are bought\nincreasingly and put into sexual slavery in all countries in the world. Sweden has got a good approach to it. About 15 to 20 years ago, Sweden\ndecided to change the law, and women are no longer prosecuted if they are in sexual slavery, but the brothel owners and the pimps\nand the male customers are prosecuted, and -- (Applause) --\nprostitution has gone down. In the United States, we take\njust the opposite position. For every male arrested\nfor illegal sex trade, 25 women are arrested\nin the United States of America. Canada, Ireland, I've already said Sweden, France, and other countries are moving now\ntowards this so-called Swedish model. That's another thing that can be done. We have two great institutions\nin this country that all of us admire: our military and our great\nuniversity system. In the military, they are now analyzing\nhow many sexual assaults take place. The last report I got,\nthere were 26,000 sexual assaults that took place in the military -- 26,000. Only 3,000, not much more than 1 percent,\nare actually prosecuted, and the reason is that the commanding\nofficer of any organization -- a ship like my submarine,\nor a battalion in the Army or a company in the Marines -- the commanding officer\nhas the right under law to decide whether to prosecute a rapist or not, and of course, the last thing they want\nis for anybody to know that under their command,\nsexual assaults are taking place, so they do not do it. That law needs to be changed. About one out of four girls\nwho enter American universities will be sexually assaulted\nbefore she graduates, and this is now getting\na lot of publicity, partially because of my book,\nbut other things, and so 89 universities in America\nare now condemned by the Department of Education\nunder Title IX because the officials of the universities\nare not taking care of the women to protect them from sexual assault. The Department of Justice says\nthat more than half of the rapes on a college campus\ntake place by serial rapists, because outside of the university system, if they rape somebody,\nthey'll be prosecuted, but when they get on a university campus,\nthey can rape with impunity. They're not prosecuted. Those are the kinds of things\nthat go on in our society. Another thing that's very serious\nabout the abuse of women and girls is the lack of equal pay for equal work, as you know. (Applause) And this is sometimes misinterpreted,\nbut for full-time employment, a woman in the United States now\ngets 23 percent less than a man. When I became president,\nthe difference was 39 percent. So we've made some progress,\npartially because I was president and so forth -- (Applause) (Laughter) -- but in the last 15 years,\nthere's been no progress made, so it's been just about 23\nor 24 percent difference for the last 15 years. These are the kind of things that go on. If you take the Fortune 500 companies, 23 of them have women CEOs, out of 500, and those CEOs, I need not tell you, make less on an average than the other CEOs. Well, that's what goes on in our country. Another problem with the United States is we are the most warlike\nnation on Earth. We have been to war\nwith about 25 different countries since the Second World War. Sometimes, we've had soldiers\non the ground fighting. The other times,\nwe've been flying overhead dropping bombs on people. Other times, of course, now, we have\ndrones that attack people and so forth. We've been at war\nwith 25 different countries or more since the Second World War. There was four years,\nI won't say which ones, where we didn't -- (Applause) -- we didn't drop a bomb,\nwe didn't launch a missile, we didn't fire a bullet. But anyway, those kinds of things,\nthe resort to violence and the misinterpretation\nof the holy scriptures are what causes, are the basic causes,\nof abuse of women and girls. There's one more basic cause\nthat I need not mention, and that is that in general,\nmen don't give a damn. (Applause)\nThat's true. The average man that might say,\nI'm against the abuse of women and girls quietly accepts the privileged\nposition that we occupy, and this is very similar\nto what I knew when I was a child, when separate but equal had existed. Racial discrimination, legally,\nhad existed for 100 years, from 1865 at the end of the War\nBetween the States, the Civil War, all the way up to the 1960s, when Lyndon Johnson got the bills passed for equal rights. But during that time,\nthere were many white people that didn't think that\nracial discrimination was okay, but they stayed quiet, because they enjoyed the privileges\nof better jobs, unique access to jury duty, better schools, and everything else, and that's the same thing\nthat exists today, because the average man\nreally doesn't care. Even though they say, \"I'm against\ndiscrimination against girls and women,\" they enjoy a privileged position. And it's very difficult to get\nthe majority of men who control the university system, the majority of men that control\nthe military system, the majority of men that control\nthe governments of the world, and the majority of men that control\nthe great religions. So what is the basic thing\nthat we need to do today? I would say the best thing\nthat we could do today is for the women in the powerful nations like this one, and where you come from, Europe and so forth, who have influence\nand who have freedom to speak and to act, need to take the responsibility\non yourselves to be more forceful in demanding an end to racial discrimination\nagainst girls and women all over the world. The average woman in Egypt doesn't have much to say\nabout her daughters getting genitally mutilated and so forth. I didn't even go down\nto detail about that. But I hope that out of this conference, that every woman here \nwill get your husbands to realize that these abuses on the college campuses\nand the military and so forth and in the future job market, need to protect your daughters\nand your granddaughters. I have 12 grandchildren,\nfour children, and 10 great-grandchildren, and I think often about them and about the plight that they\nwill face in America, not only if they lived in Egypt\nor a foreign country, in having equal rights, and I hope that all of you will join me in being a champion for women\nand girls around the world and protect their human rights. Thank you very much.

{"page": 28, "lesson": 18, "title": "9 Futuristic Materials", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/DReOMa4l", "transcript": {"en": "In Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home -- ever seen\nit? Came out in 1986? The crew of the original Enterprise go back\nin time? To … 1986? Anyway, there’s a scene where chief engineer\nScotty describes a lighter, sturdier, futuristic alternative to plexiglass: transparent aluminum. This stuff is supposed to be so strong that\nit makes up the viewports of the Enterprise. The coolest part though, is that this stuff\nis not just science fiction! Transparent aluminum actually exists, and\nit pretty much lives up to Scotty’s hype. And it’s just one of many cool new materials\nthat seem like they were plucked straight out of science fiction. From invisibility cloaks to self-repairing\nconcrete, the future is now. [Music Playing] Aerogels are one of the lightest solid materials\nin the world. Gels are mostly liquid, but they act like\nsolids because there’s a bunch of molecules in them that link together and hold the liquid\nin place. Aerogels are gels where all the liquid has\nbeen replaced with gas. Imagine taking your favorite gelatin dessert\nand sucking out all the water. But instead of crumbling into a powder, it still keeps\nits dome-like shape. That’s basically how scientists create aerogels: First, they make a gel out of something like\nsilicon or carbon compounds. Then, they use extremely high temperatures\nand pressures to blur the line between the liquid and gas phases, creating a supercritical\nfluid. Then the kinda-liquid-kinda-gas can drift\nout of the solid molecular structure, and be replaced by air, so you have a porous,\nlightweight material that retains its shape. Aerogels are great for insulation, because\nthe air inside doesn’t transfer heat very well. So they’re mostly being used in spacesuit\nand spacecraft linings. Plus, they’re almost transparent, which\nmeans we could use aerogels to insulate windows here on Earth… when they get cheaper. If you’re a Harry Potter fan, chances are\nyou’ve wanted your own invisibility cloak. But instead of using magic to make things\ninvisible, muggle researchers need to experiment with light. We don’t have large-scale invisibility cloak\ntechnology yet, but scientists are working on a lot of different ideas, like creating\nflexible sheets of liquid metal that can block radio waves used in radar. And we’re getting closer. In 2015, scientists designed a very, very\nthin material, like, 80 nanometers thin, that could hide equally tiny objects. In order for us to see an object, light has\nto bounce off of it. And any distortions of that light reveal its shape and features. This invisibility cloak uses teeny-tiny brick-shaped\ngold antennas to counteract that natural light distortion. So when this cloak is wrapped around an object,\nany light bouncing off of it looks like it’s coming from a perfectly flat mirror, hiding\nthe fact that the cloak and object are even there. And theoretically, you could adjust the gold\nantennas to make the reflected light look like any object or background. This technology only exists at a microscopic\nlevel right now, so scientists need to figure out how to scale up the idea before we can\nmake larger objects, like people, invisible. So we can’t quite make objects invisible,\nbut what about super waterproof, or superhydrophobic, materials? I’m talking way more waterproof than your\naverage raincoat. Scientists are trying to find ways to mimic\nthe waterproof surfaces found in nature, like the lotus leaf or certain butterfly wings. And it turns out that microscopically rough\nsurfaces tend to be more hydrophobic, because they can trap pockets of air and minimize\nthe interaction between water droplets and the surface of the material. So scientists can make coatings that have\nthings like aluminum oxide nanoparticles in them, to make surfaces rougher and repel water. Another idea is to make surfaces that are\ncovered in itty bitty ridges or polymer cones, that are just tens of nanometers in size,\nthousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair. These materials are so waterproof that water\ndroplets actually appear to bounce off of them, and even split into smaller pieces! By putting this stuff on electronics and medical\ndevices, we can protect them from water damage, but these materials may also be someday used\nto keep ice from forming on cars, or algae growing on ships. Carbon is… amazing. Like, the-basis-of-all-life-as-we-know-it amazing. We’ve talked before about how awesome some carbon-based materials are, like graphene. But we can use what we know about carbon to\nmake a material even harder than diamonds. Aggregated diamond nanorods, or hyperdiamonds,\nif you wanna sound cool, these are the hardest, most dense, and least compressible material\nwe know of. Diamonds are hard because of their molecular\nstructure, each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds with the atoms around it, which forms\nan exceptionally hard crystal structure. In hyperdiamonds, that’s still true, but\nit’s a different, more wear-resistant form of diamond. This material is made up of many tiny, interlocked\ndiamond crystals rather than one single structure. They can be made in the lab by applying extreme\nheat and pressure to graphite. Diamonds are frequently used for industrial\njobs like grinding and polishing, because they’re so tough. But hyperdiamonds could be even more useful\nthan regular diamonds, because they’re even more resistant to the temperature and pressure\nchanges that can wear diamonds down over time. Now, when can metal also be glass? Well, when engineers invent … metallic glass,\nalso known as amorphous metal. Most metals have a crystalline structure,\nthe atoms are ordered into a specific, repeated pattern that makes it stiff. But glass has a random arrangement of atoms,\nwhich makes it more brittle. So, metallic glasses form when metal atoms\nare in this random arrangement, like when melted metal is cooled really, really quickly,\nbefore its particles can arrange themselves into a crystal. This material has the best of both worlds,\nthe malleability of molten glass combined with even more strength than crystalline metal. This combination of high strength and low\nstiffness makes it really resilient, it can store and release elastic energy better than\nother forms of metal, which means it doesn’t deform as easily. Right now metallic glasses are being used\nas coatings to make objects more corrosion or wear-resistant, or to make products like\ngolf club heads. But eventually the material could be used\nto easily manufacture things where strength and weight are concerns, like lighter, stronger\ncar parts. But glass isn’t the only hot new metal material. Metallic foams are made up of a metal, like\naluminum, and a whole bunch of gas-filled pores. This makes them super light, plus they keep\nmany of the original properties of their metal, like being strong, fire resistant, and conducting\nelectricity. Metallic foams can be made a few different\nways, like by injecting gas into a liquid metal, or by causing the precipitation of\ngas that’s already dissolved in a metal mixture. And some are open-pored, meaning that the\ngas pores inside are all interconnected, creating what are sometimes called metal sponges. But in closed-pored metal foams, the little\nbubbles are all separated, which means they can float in water, which could be helpful\nfor building sturdier, lighter boats and spacecraft that can make water landings. In general, metal foams are useful for high-tech\nshock and impact absorbers, the gas inside makes them extremely compressible, so they\ncan absorb a lot of mechanical energy, while still retaining some of the strength and durability\nof a metal. This means they also have a lot of potential\nfor building different car components that are light and sturdy. Some metals also have unique new uses, like\naluminum. In Star Trek IV, it’s called transparent\naluminum, but that’s kind of inaccurate. The material our scientists are manufacturing\nis really aluminum oxynitride and it’s composed of aluminum, oxygen, and nitrogen. It’s a ceramic, which means the material\nstarts as a powder, and is then heated up until it melts, and then cooled into a crystalline\nstructure similar to glass. It’s basically transparent, and extremely\nstrong, nearly as hard as sapphire, so aluminum oxynitride is really useful for things ranging\nfrom bulletproof windows to super-durable camera lenses. It’s still expensive to make, but hopefully\nwe’ll find ways to make it more efficient by the time we get around to building starships! Concrete! I’m sure you’re\nfamiliar with it. Just today, you’ve probably walked on it, or sat on it -- in\nfact, it’s probably all around you right now! But as materials go, it’s not very... cozy. The invention of light-transmitting concrete\nhopes to change that, by interspersing very thin layers of concrete with optical fibers. This means light can be transmitted from\none end of a concrete block to the other. The translucent concrete maintains most of\nits strength, so it can still be used for heavy duty projects, like constructing buildings\nor roadways, or it can be used in otherwise difficult-to-light areas, like subway tunnels\nand walkways. Unfortunately, we haven’t found a way to\npour this stuff out on-site like traditional concrete, which means it’s not really practical\nyet, mostly it’s used in art installations or very small areas. But with some more research, fancy glowing\nsidewalks may become the new normal. Now, what if we could increase the lifespan\nof concrete that’s already been poured? Enter: self-healing concrete. Invented by scientists in the Netherlands,\nthe basic concept is to combine engineering with microbiology, and embed bacteria that\ncan create limestone directly in the concrete. During normal seasonal changes, concrete shrinks\nand expands and eventually cracks. Then water can seep in, causing even more\ndamage. But self-repairing concrete, contains biodegradable\ncapsules that are full of bacteria and their food source, in this case, calcium lactate. The bacteria lie dormant until the water seeping\nin dissolves the capsules and sets them to work, eating and multiplying and producing\ncalcite, or limestone, from the calcium lactate, which fills in the cracks. These bacteria can survive up to 200 years\nif there’s enough nutrition embedded in the concrete. Currently, the bacteria can only heal very\nsmall cracks, but eventually this technology could fill larger breaks, which could be huge\nfor fixing roads and building more durable buildings, without hands-on construction time! So, scientists are developing all kinds of\nnew materials with incredible properties and weird new uses. Soon we’ll be building the future with all\nthese technologies, and more.

The paper is too wide, and hangs out. So you cut off the extra and end up with all these strips of paper. And to keep yourself amused during your math class you start playing with them. And by you, I mean Arthur H. Stone in 1939. Anyway, there's lots of cool things you can do with a strip of paper. You can fold it into shapes. And more shapes. Maybe spiral it around snugly like this. Maybe make it into a square. Maybe wrap it into a hexagon with a nice symmetric sort of cycle to the flappy parts. In fact, there's enough space here to keep wrapping the strip, and then your hexagon is pretty stable. And you're like, \"I don't know, hexagons aren't too exciting, but I guess it has symmetry or something.\" Maybe you could kinda fold it so the flappy parts are down and the unflappy parts are up. That's symmetric, and it collapses down into these three triangles, which collapse down into one triangle, and collapsible hexagons are, you suppose, cool enough to at least amuse you a little bit during your class. And then, since hexagons have six-way symmetry, you decide to try this three-way fold the other way, with flappy parts up, and are collapsing it down when suddenly the inside of your hexagon decides to open right up. What? You close it back up and undo it. Everything seems the same as before, the center is not open-uppable. But when you fold it that way again, it, like, flips inside-out. Weird. This time, instead of going backwards, you try doing it again. And again. And again. And again. And you want to make one that's a little less messy, so you try again with another strip and tape it nicely into a twisty-foldy loop. You decide that it would be cool to color the sides, so you get out a highlighter and make one yellow. Now you can flip from yellow side to white side. Yellow side, white side, yellow side, white side Hmm. White side? What? Where did the yellow side go? So you go back, and this time you color the white side green, and find that your paper has three sides. Yellow, white, and green. Now this thing is definitely cool. Therefore, you need to name it. And since it's shaped like a hexagon and you flex it and flex rhymes with hex, hexaflexagon it is. That night, you can't sleep because you keep thinking about hexaflexagons. And the next day, as soon as you get to your math class you pull out your paper strips. You had made this sort of spirally folded paper that folds into again, the shape of a piece of paper, and you decide to take that And use it like a strip of paper to make a hexaflexagon. Which would totally work, but it feels sturdier with the extra paper. And you color the three sides and are like, Orange, yellow, pink. And you're sort of trying to pay attention to class. Math, yeah. Orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, white? Wait a second. Okay, so you color that one green. And now it's orange, yellow, green. Orange, yellow, green. Who knows where the pink side went? Oh, there it is. Now it's back to orange, yellow, pink. Orange, yellow, pink. Hmm. Blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, blue. Yellow, pink, huh. With the old flexagon, you could only flex it one way, flappy way up. But now there's more flaps. So maybe you can fold it both ways. Yes, one goes from pink to blue, but the other, from pink to orange. And now, one way goes from orange to yellow, but the other way goes from orange to...neon yellow. During lunch you want to show this off to one of your new friends, Bryant Tuckerman. You start with the original, simple, three-faced hexaflexagon, which you call the trihexaflexagon. And he's like, whoa! and wants to learn how to make one. And you're like, it's easy! Just start with a paper strip, fold it into equilateral triangles, and you'll need nine of them, and you fold them around into this cycle and make sure it's all symmetric. The flat parts are diamonds, and if they're not, then you're doing it wrong. And then you just tape the first triangle to the last along the edge, and you're good. But Tuckerman doesn't have tape. After all, it was invented only 10 years ago. So he cuts out ten triangles instead of nine, and then glues the first to the last. Then you show him how to flex it by pinching around a flappy part and pushing in on the opposite side to make it flat and trianglly, and then opening from the center. You decide to start a flexagon commitee together to explore the mysteries of flexagation. But that will have to wait until next time."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who invented the hexaflexagon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thomas Edison"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arthur H.

{"page": 28, "lesson": 20, "title": "The surprising reason birds sing - Partha P. Mitra", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-birds-learn-to-sing-partha-mitra", "transcript": {"en": "This is a song sung by a brown thrasher. But that’s just one of the thousand \nor more that it knows, and it’s not the only avian virtuoso. A wood thrush can sing \ntwo pitches at once. A mockingbird can match the sounds \naround it, including car alarms. And the Australian superb lyrebird has an incredible, elaborate song \nand dance ritual. These are just a few of \nthe 4,000 species of songbirds. Most birds produce short, simple calls, but songbirds also have \na repertoire of complex vocal patterns that help them attract mates, defend territory, and strengthen their social bonds. Each songbird species \nhas its own distinct song patterns, some with characteristic \nregional dialects. Experienced listeners can even distinguish\nindividual birds by their unique songs. So how do birds learn these songs \nin the first place? How do they know to mimic the songs \nof their own species? Are they born knowing how to sing? A lot of what scientists know about bird\nsong comes from studying zebra finches. A baby male zebra finch typically learns \nto sing from its father or other males, starting while it’s still \na fledgling in the nest. First comes a sensory learning phase, when the baby finch hears the songs\nsung around it and commits them to memory. The bird starts to vocalize \nduring the motor learning phase, practicing until it can \nmatch the song it memorized. As the bird learns, hearing \nthe tutor’s song over and over again is helpful—\nup to a point. If he hears it too many times, the\nimitation degrades— and the source matters. If the song is played \nthrough a loudspeaker, he can’t pick it up as easily. But hide the same loudspeaker inside \na toy painted to look like a zebra finch, and his learning improves. What if the baby never hears another \nzebra finch’s song? Interestingly enough, it’ll sing anyway. Isolated finches still produce \nwhat are called innate or isolate songs. A specific tune might be taught, but the instinct to sing seems\nto be hardwired into a songbird’s brain. Innate songs sound different from\nthe “cultured” songs learned from other finches—at first. If isolated zebra finches \nstart a new colony, the young birds pick up \nthe isolate song from their parents. But the song changes \nfrom generation to generation. And after a few iterations, the melody actually starts to resemble the cultured songs sung \nby zebra finches in the wild. Something about the learning process \nmust be hardwired, too, drawing the birds towards the\nsame song patterns again and again. This means that basic information \nabout the zebra finch song must be stored somewhere \nin its genome, imprinted there by millions \nof years of evolution. At first, this might seem odd, as we usually think of genetic code as a\nsource of biochemical or physical traits, not something like a behavior or action. But the two aren’t \nfundamentally different; we can connect genomes to\nbehavior through brain circuitry. The connection is noisy and quite complex. It doesn’t simply map single genes \nto single behaviors, but it exists. Genomes contain codes for proteins \nthat guide brain development, such as molecules that guide the pathways\nof developing axons, shaping distinct circuits. Birds’ brains \nhave so-called “song circuits” that are active when the birds sing. These circuits also respond to the song \nof a bird’s own species more strongly than\nto other species’ songs. So the theory is that a bird’s genes \nguide development of brain circuits that relate to singing \nand the ability to learn songs. Then, exposure to songs \nshapes those neural circuits to produce the songs \nthat are typical to that species. Genetically encoded or innate behaviors \naren’t unique to songbirds. They’re widespread in the animal kingdom. Spectacular examples include the long-distance migrations \nof monarch butterflies and salmon. So what does this mean for humans? Are we also born with innate \ninformation written into our genomes that helps shape our neural circuits, and ultimately results \nin something we know? Could there be some knowledge that is unique \nand intrinsic to humans as a species?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many species of songbirds are there?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8,000"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many species of songbirds are there?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8,000"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The vocal patterns of songbirds help them _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Attract mates"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Defend territory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Strengthen their social bonds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Isolated finches can still produce songs.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After a few generations, the innate songs of a zebra finch colony _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stay the same"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Disappear as the colony breaks apart"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eventually resemble the cultured songs sung by zebra finches in the wild"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Scientists theorize that _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A bird’s genes guide the development of brain circuits related to singing and the ability to learn songs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A bird’s genes guide the development of tail feathers, which influences a songbird’s vibrato"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A songbird is not able to sing if it has not heard any birdsong previously"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A bird’s genes do not dictate the development of singing in songbirds"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 28, "lesson": 21, "title": "Are you a giver or a taker? - Adam Grant", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/bJ27nOxj", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Leslie Gauthier\nReviewer: Camille Martínez I want you to look\naround the room for a minute and try to find the most\nparanoid person here -- (Laughter) And then I want you to point\nat that person for me. (Laughter) OK, don't actually do it. (Laughter) But, as an organizational psychologist, I spend a lot of time in workplaces, and I find paranoia everywhere. Paranoia is caused by people\nthat I call \"takers.\" Takers are self-serving\nin their interactions. It's all about what can you do for me. The opposite is a giver. It's somebody who approaches\nmost interactions by asking, \"What can I do for you?\" I wanted to give you a chance\nto think about your own style. We all have moments of giving and taking. Your style is how you treat\nmost of the people most of the time, your default. I have a short test you can take to figure out if you're more\nof a giver or a taker, and you can take it right now. [The Narcissist Test] [Step 1: Take a moment\nto think about yourself.] (Laughter) [Step 2: If you made it to Step 2,\nyou are not a narcissist.] (Laughter) This is the only thing I will say today\nthat has no data behind it, but I am convinced the longer it takes\nfor you to laugh at this cartoon, the more worried we should be\nthat you're a taker. (Laughter) Of course, not all takers are narcissists. Some are just givers who got burned\none too many times. Then there's another kind of taker\nthat we won't be addressing today, and that's called a psychopath. (Laughter) I was curious, though, about how\ncommon these extremes are, and so I surveyed over 30,000\npeople across industries around the world's cultures. And I found that most people\nare right in the middle between giving and taking. They choose this third style\ncalled \"matching.\" If you're a matcher, you try to keep\nan even balance of give and take: quid pro quo -- I'll do something\nfor you if you do something for me. And that seems like a safe way\nto live your life. But is it the most effective\nand productive way to live your life? The answer to that question\nis a very definitive ... maybe. (Laughter) I studied dozens of organizations, thousands of people. I had engineers measuring\ntheir productivity. (Laughter) I looked at medical students' grades -- even salespeople's revenue. (Laughter) And, unexpectedly, the worst performers in each\nof these jobs were the givers. The engineers who got the least work done were the ones who did more favors\nthan they got back. They were so busy doing\nother people's jobs, they literally ran out of time and energy\nto get their own work completed. In medical school, the lowest grades\nbelong to the students who agree most strongly\nwith statements like, \"I love helping others,\" which suggests the doctor\nyou ought to trust is the one who came to med school\nwith no desire to help anybody. (Laughter) And then in sales, too,\nthe lowest revenue accrued in the most generous salespeople. I actually reached out\nto one of those salespeople who had a very high giver score. And I asked him, \"Why do\nyou suck at your job --\" I didn't ask it that way, but -- (Laughter) \"What's the cost of generosity in sales?\" And he said, \"Well, I just care\nso deeply about my customers that I would never sell them\none of our crappy products.\" (Laughter) So just out of curiosity, how many of you self-identify more\nas givers than takers or matchers? Raise your hands. OK, it would have been more\nbefore we talked about these data. But actually, it turns out\nthere's a twist here, because givers are often\nsacrificing themselves, but they make their organizations better. We have a huge body of evidence -- many, many studies looking\nat the frequency of giving behavior that exists in a team\nor an organization -- and the more often people are helping\nand sharing their knowledge and providing mentoring, the better organizations do\non every metric we can measure: higher profits, customer satisfaction,\nemployee retention -- even lower operating expenses. So givers spend a lot of time\ntrying to help other people and improve the team, and then, unfortunately,\nthey suffer along the way. I want to talk about what it takes to build cultures where givers\nactually get to succeed. So I wondered, then, if givers\nare the worst performers, who are the best performers? Let me start with the good news:\nit's not the takers. Takers tend to rise quickly\nbut also fall quickly in most jobs. And they fall at the hands of matchers. If you're a matcher, you believe\nin \"An eye for an eye\" -- a just world. And so when you meet a taker, you feel like it's your mission in life to just punish the hell\nout of that person. (Laughter) And that way justice gets served. Well, most people are matchers. And that means if you're a taker, it tends to catch up with you eventually; what goes around will come around. And so the logical conclusion is: it must be the matchers\nwho are the best performers. But they're not. In every job, in every organization\nI've ever studied, the best results belong\nto the givers again. Take a look at some data I gathered\nfrom hundreds of salespeople, tracking their revenue. What you can see is that the givers\ngo to both extremes. They make up the majority of people\nwho bring in the lowest revenue, but also the highest revenue. The same patterns were true\nfor engineers' productivity and medical students' grades. Givers are overrepresented\nat the bottom and at the top of every success metric that I can track. Which raises the question: How do we create a world\nwhere more of these givers get to excel? I want to talk about how to do that,\nnot just in businesses, but also in nonprofits, schools -- even governments. Are you ready? (Cheers) I was going to do it anyway,\nbut I appreciate the enthusiasm. (Laughter) The first thing that's really critical is to recognize that givers\nare your most valuable people, but if they're not careful, they burn out. So you have to protect\nthe givers in your midst. And I learned a great lesson about this\nfrom Fortune's best networker. It's the guy, not the cat. (Laughter) His name is Adam Rifkin. He's a very successful serial entrepreneur who spends a huge amount\nof his time helping other people. And his secret weapon\nis the five-minute favor. Adam said, \"You don't have to be\nMother Teresa or Gandhi to be a giver. You just have to find small ways\nto add large value to other people's lives.\" That could be as simple\nas making an introduction between two people who could\nbenefit from knowing each other. It could be sharing your knowledge\nor giving a little bit of feedback. Or It might be even something\nas basic as saying, \"You know, I'm going to try and figure out if I can recognize somebody\nwhose work has gone unnoticed.\" And those five-minute favors\nare really critical to helping givers set boundaries\nand protect themselves. The second thing that matters if you want to build a culture\nwhere givers succeed, is you actually need a culture\nwhere help-seeking is the norm; where people ask a lot. This may hit a little too close\nto home for some of you. [So in all your relationships,\nyou always have to be the giver?] (Laughter) What you see with successful givers is they recognize that it's OK\nto be a receiver, too. If you run an organization,\nwe can actually make this easier. We can make it easier\nfor people to ask for help. A couple colleagues and I\nstudied hospitals. We found that on certain floors,\nnurses did a lot of help-seeking, and on other floors,\nthey did very little of it. The factor that stood out on the floors\nwhere help-seeking was common, where it was the norm, was there was just one nurse\nwhose sole job it was to help other nurses on the unit. When that role was available, nurses said, \"It's not embarrassing,\nit's not vulnerable to ask for help -- it's actually encouraged.\" Help-seeking isn't important\njust for protecting the success and the well-being of givers. It's also critical to getting\nmore people to act like givers, because the data say that somewhere between 75 and 90 percent\nof all giving in organizations starts with a request. But a lot of people don't ask. They don't want to look incompetent, they don't know where to turn,\nthey don't want to burden others. Yet if nobody ever asks for help, you have a lot of frustrated givers\nin your organization who would love to step up and contribute, if they only knew\nwho could benefit and how. But I think the most important thing, if you want to build a culture\nof successful givers, is to be thoughtful about who\nyou let onto your team. I figured, you want a culture\nof productive generosity, you should hire a bunch of givers. But I was surprised to discover, actually,\nthat that was not right -- that the negative impact\nof a taker on a culture is usually double to triple\nthe positive impact of a giver. Think about it this way: one bad apple can spoil a barrel, but one good egg\njust does not make a dozen. I don't know what that means -- (Laughter) But I hope you do. No -- let even one taker into a team, and you will see that the givers\nwill stop helping. They'll say, \"I'm surrounded\nby a bunch of snakes and sharks. Why should I contribute?\" Whereas if you let one giver into a team, you don't get an explosion of generosity. More often, people are like, \"Great! That person can do all our work.\" So, effective hiring and screening\nand team building is not about bringing in the givers; it's about weeding out the takers. If you can do that well, you'll be left with givers and matchers. The givers will be generous because they don't have to worry\nabout the consequences. And the beauty of the matchers\nis that they follow the norm. So how do you catch a taker\nbefore it's too late? We're actually pretty bad\nat figuring out who's a taker, especially on first impressions. There's a personality trait\nthat throws us off. It's called agreeableness, one the major dimensions\nof personality across cultures. Agreeable people are warm and friendly,\nthey're nice, they're polite. You find a lot of them in Canada -- (Laughter) Where there was actually\na national contest to come up with a new Canadian slogan\nand fill in the blank, \"As Canadian as ...\" I thought the winning entry\nwas going to be, \"As Canadian as maple syrup,\"\nor, \"... ice hockey.\" But no, Canadians voted\nfor their new national slogan to be -- I kid you not -- \"As Canadian as possible\nunder the circumstances.\" (Laughter) Now for those of you\nwho are highly agreeable, or maybe slightly Canadian, you get this right away. How could I ever say I'm any one thing when I'm constantly adapting\nto try to please other people? Disagreeable people do less of it. They're more critical,\nskeptical, challenging, and far more likely than their peers\nto go to law school. (Laughter) That's not a joke,\nthat's actually an empirical fact. (Laughter) So I always assumed\nthat agreeable people were givers and disagreeable people were takers. But then I gathered the data, and I was stunned to find\nno correlation between those traits, because it turns out\nthat agreeableness-disagreeableness is your outer veneer: How pleasant is it to interact with you? Whereas giving and taking\nare more of your inner motives: What are your values?\nWhat are your intentions toward others? If you really want to judge\npeople accurately, you have to get to the moment every\nconsultant in the room is waiting for, and draw a two-by-two. (Laughter) The agreeable givers are easy to spot: they say yes to everything. The disagreeable takers\nare also recognized quickly, although you might call them\nby a slightly different name. (Laughter) We forget about the other\ntwo combinations. There are disagreeable givers\nin our organizations. There are people who are gruff\nand tough on the surface but underneath have\nothers' best interests at heart. Or as an engineer put it, \"Oh, disagreeable givers -- like somebody with a bad user interface\nbut a great operating system.\" (Laughter) If that helps you. (Laughter) Disagreeable givers are the most\nundervalued people in our organizations, because they're the ones\nwho give the critical feedback that no one wants to hear\nbut everyone needs to hear. We need to do a much better job\nvaluing these people as opposed to writing them off early, and saying, \"Eh, kind of prickly, must be a selfish taker.\" The other combination we forget about\nis the deadly one -- the agreeable taker,\nalso known as the faker. This is the person\nwho's nice to your face, and then will stab you right in the back. (Laughter) And my favorite way to catch\nthese people in the interview process is to ask the question, \"Can you give me the names of four people whose careers you have\nfundamentally improved?\" The takers will give you four names, and they will all be more\ninfluential than them, because takers are great at kissing up\nand then kicking down. Givers are more likely to name people\nwho are below them in a hierarchy, who don't have as much power, who can do them no good. And let's face it, you all know\nyou can learn a lot about character by watching how someone\ntreats their restaurant server or their Uber driver. So if we do all this well, if we can weed takers\nout of organizations, if we can make it safe to ask for help, if we can protect givers from burnout and make it OK for them to be ambitious\nin pursuing their own goals as well as trying to help other people, we can actually change the way\nthat people define success. Instead of saying it's all about\nwinning a competition, people will realize success\nis really more about contribution. I believe that the most\nmeaningful way to succeed is to help other people succeed. And if we can spread that belief, we can actually turn paranoia upside down. There's a name for that. It's called \"pronoia.\" Pronoia is the delusional belief that other people\nare plotting your well-being. (Laughter) That they're going around behind your back and saying exceptionally\nglowing things about you. The great thing about a culture of givers\nis that's not a delusion -- it's reality. I want to live in a world\nwhere givers succeed, and I hope you will help me\ncreate that world. Thank you.

That was fair: we all know there’s an equal chance \nof getting heads and tails. But what if they had \na more complicated contest? What if they flipped coins repeatedly, so that Orville would win as soon as \ntwo heads showed up in a row on his coin, and Wilbur would win as soon as heads \nwas immediately followed by tails on his? Would each brother still have had an equal\nchance to be the first in flight? At first, it may seem they’d still have \nthe same chance of winning. There are four combinations\nfor two consecutive flips. And if you do flip a coin just twice, there’s an equal chance \nof each one -- 25%. So your intuition might tell you \nthat in any string of coin flips, each combination would have \nthe same shot at appearing first. Unfortunately, you’d be wrong. Wilbur actually has\na big advantage in this contest. Imagine our sequence of coin flips \nas a sort of board game, where every flip determines which\npath we take. The goal is to get from start to finish. The heads/tails board looks like this. And this is the head/head board. There’s one critical difference. Heads/heads has a move that sends you \nall the way back to the start that heads/tails doesn’t have. That’s why heads/heads\ntakes longer on average. So we can demonstrate that this is true\nusing probability and algebra to calculate the average number of flips\nit would take to get each combination. Let’s start with the heads/tails board, and define x to be the average \nnumber of flips to advance one step. Focus only on the arrows. It has two identical steps, each with a 50/50 chance of staying \nin place or moving forward. Option 1: If we stay in place by getting \ntails, we waste one flip. Since we’re back in the same place, on average we must flip x more times \nto advance one step. Together with that first flip, this gives an average of x + 1 \ntotal flips to advance. Option 2: If we get heads \nand move forward, then we have taken exactly one total flip \nto advance one step. We can now combine option 1 \nand option 2 with their probabilities to get this expression. Solving that for x gives us an average \nof two moves to advance one step. Since each step is identical, we can multiply by two and arrive\nat four flips to advance two steps. For heads/heads, \nthe picture isn’t as simple. This time, let y be the average number \nof flips to move from start to finish. There are two options for the first move, \neach with 50/50 odds. Option 1 is the same as before, getting tails sends us back to the start, giving an average \nof y+1 total flips to finish. In Option 2, there are two equally \nlikely cases for the next flip. With heads we’d be done after two flips. But tails would return us to the start. Since we’d return after two flips, we’d then need an average\nof y+2 flips in total to finish. So our full expression will be this. And solving this equation \ngives us six flips. So the math calculates that it takes an\naverage of six flips to get heads/heads, and an average of four \nto get heads/tails. And, in fact, that’s what you’d see if you\ntested it for yourself enough times. Of course, the Wright brothers didn’t \nneed to work all this out; they only flipped the coin once,\nand Wilbur won. But it didn’t matter: \nWilbur’s flight failed, and Orville made \naviation history, instead. Tough luck, Wilbur."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "If you flip a fair coin twice, what is the probability that you see heads followed by tails?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1/4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1/3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1/2"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3/4"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the average number of flips before you see tails immediately followed by heads?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "6"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When we model the coin flipping as a board game, what causes you to move from Start to H in either board?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It’s a game where it is your choice where you’d like to move"}, {"label": "B", "text": "You see heads on your 1st, 3rd, 5th, or any odd-numbered flip"}, {"label": "C", "text": "You were at Start and your next flip comes up heads"}, {"label": "D", "text": "You are anywhere in the coin flipping process, and your next flip comes up heads"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Suppose that you were playing an abstract board game similar to the heads/tails game, except that it had four positions in this order: Start, B, C, and End.

{"page": 28, "lesson": 23, "title": "How far can we go?", "category": "Cognition and Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/Ot0d70LO", "transcript": {"en": "Is there a border we will never cross? Are there places we will never reach, no matter how hard we try? Turns out there are. Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go? We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way a spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality it consists mostly of empty space With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of years So our galaxy is... pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies, it's part of the \"local group\" a region of space about ten million light years in diameter It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster. Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe. Now, let's assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics. In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening. Why can't we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty space, isn't empty but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the smallest scale, there is constant action. Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions. Now, let's go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme that all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well, and subatomic distances became galactic distances. With dense, and less dense regions. After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together. At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious. So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe... grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait, what's the problem then? Why can't we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here, dark energy makes everything complicated. About six billion years ago, dark energy took over. It's basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We don't know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly. In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group... that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away. But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can't ever hope to match. We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded, the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years. But it becomes even more depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away... that they will be too faint to detect ... and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions, forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe! When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won't be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing what we know today. The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end. They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven't figured out how to leave our Solar System... and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time, to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated and remote as the Local Group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now. Thanks so much for the help of the video to Ethan Seagal.
