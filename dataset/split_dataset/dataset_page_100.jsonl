If so, you're not alone. People have wondered about this strange effect since ancient times, and surprisingly, we still don't have a great explanation, but that's not for lack of trying. Some of the greatest minds in history - Aristotle, Ptolemy, Da Vinci, Decartes - have all wrestled with this problem and failed to generate an adequate explanation. One of the first ideas suggested was that the image of the moon in the sky really is bigger near the horizon. Perhaps the Earth's atmosphere acts like a giant lens, magnifying the moon as it rises and sets. But this explanation doesn't cut it. If anything, the refraction of the atmosphere would make the moon look slightly smaller. Plus, if you actually measure the size of the visible moon at different positions, it doesn't change at all. But then, why does it still seem bigger when it's rising? This must be some kind of optical illusion. The question is, which one? One explanation is the Ebbinghaus Illusion, where two identical objects look different because of the relative size of the objects they're surrounded by. Here the two center circles are actually the same size. Maybe the moon looks bigger near the horizon because it's next to tiny trees, houses, and towers in the distance. But when the moon is higher up, it's surrounded by the vast darkness of the night sky and looks tiny by comparison. Another possibility is the famous Ponzo Illusion. If you've ever tried to draw in perspective, you know that the closer something is to the horizon, the smaller you should draw it. Our brain compensates automatically for this by perceiving objects near the horizon as larger than they actually appear. The two yellow lines in this drawing are the same size, but the upper one seems bigger because we interpret it as receding farther into the horizon. So, between Ponzo and Ebbinghaus, it seems like we've solved the mystery of the moon illusion, but, unfortunately, there are a few details that complicate things. For one thing, if this was just the Ebbinghaus effect, then we would expect the moon illusion to disappear for pilots flying high above the clouds since there wouldn't be any other smaller objects near the horizon. But in fact, pilots and sailors out on the ocean still claim to see the moon illusion. On the other hand, if it's just our brain's autocorrecting the size of objects near the horizon, then we'd expect the moon illusion to be visible inside a planetarium, where the whole sky, including the horizon, is displayed on a spherical dome overhead. Studies have shown, though, that this is not the case. To make matters worse, it seems the moon illusion disappears entirely if you just bend over and look at the moon between your legs. Now, this is just getting ridiculous! One of the most promising explanations today is known as Convergence Micropsia. Our brains judge the distance to objects and their apparent size by the focus of our eyes. When looking at the horizon, your eyes focus far off into the distance so your brain knows you're looking far away. The moon appears a certain size. Your brain thinks it's far away, which it is, so you naturally conclude the moon must be big. But when looking up at the night sky, there's nothing for your eyes to focus on, so they default to their rest focus, which is a point just a few meters away. Now your brain thinks the moon is much closer than it really is, so you naturally conclude the moon's not as big as you thought it was. Rather than explain why the moon looks so big near the horizon, Convergence Microspia explains why the moon looks so small when overhead. Still not satisfied? Well, frankly, neither are many scientists, so the debate over the moon illusion still rages on and may continue as long as we still see it in the night sky."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the moon illusion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The fact that the same side of the moon is always facing earth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The appearance of a “man in the moon”"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The apparent change in size of the moon as it rises and sets"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The disappearance of the moon during a lunar eclipse"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What effect could the atmosphere have in contributing to the moon illusion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The atmosphere would make the moon appear smaller at sunrise or sunset."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The atmosphere would make the moon disappear at sunrise or sunset."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The atmosphere changes the apparent color of the moon."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The atmosphere makes it look like the same side of the moon always faces us."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which sentence best describes the Ebbinghaus illusion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Two identical circles appear different because of the relative size of objects around them."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Our brains overestimate the size of objects located closer to the horizon."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pilots in airplanes have nothing to compare the moon’s size to, so it looks smaller."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The focus of our eyes impacts how large we perceive an object to be."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which sentence best describes the Ponzo illusion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Two identical circles appear different because of the relative size of objects around them."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Our brains overestimate the size of objects located closer to the horizon."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pilots in airplanes have nothing to compare the moon’s size to, so it looks smaller."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The focus of our eyes impacts how large we perceive an object to be."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the name given to the most promising explanation of the moon illusion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Refraction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ebbinghaus illusion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ponzo illusion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Convergence micropsia"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

What is déjà vu? - Michael Molina", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-deja-vu-what-is-deja-vu-michael-molina", "transcript": {"en": "Have you experienced déjà vu? It's that shadowy feeling you get\nwhen a situation seems familiar. A scene in a restaurant plays out\nexactly as you remember. The world moves like a ballet\nyou've choreographed, but the sequence can't be based\non a past experience because you've never eaten here before. This is the first time you've had clams, so what's going on? Unfortunately, there isn't\none single explanation for déjà vu. The experience is brief\nand occurs without notice, making it nearly impossible\nfor scientists to record and study it. Scientists can't simply sit around\nand wait for it to happen to them -- this could take years. It has no physical manifestations and in studies, it's described by the subject\nas a sensation or feeling. Because of this lack of hard evidence, there's been a surplus\nof speculation over the years. Since Emile Boirac introduced déjà vu as a French term meaning \"already seen,\" more than 40 theories attempt\nto explain this phenomenon. Still, recent advancements in neuroimaging\nand cognitive psychology narrow down the field of prospects. Let's walk through three of today's\nmore prevalent theories, using the same\nrestaurant setting for each. First up is dual processing. We'll need an action. Let's go with a waiter\ndropping a tray of dishes. As the scene unfolds, your brain's hemispheres process\na flurry of information: the waiter's flailing arms, his cry for help, the smell of pasta. Within milliseconds, this information\nzips through pathways and is processed into a single moment. Most of the time,\neverything is recorded in-sync. However, this theory asserts that déjà vu occurs\nwhen there's a slight delay in information from one of these pathways. The difference in arrival times causes the brain to interpret\nthe late information as a separate event. When it plays\nover the already-recorded moment, it feels as if it's happened before because, in a sense, it has. Our next theory deals\nwith a confusion of the past rather than a mistake in the present. This is the hologram theory, and we'll use that tablecloth\nto examine it. As you scan its squares, a distant memory swims up\nfrom deep within your brain. According to the theory, this is because memories are stored in the form of holograms, and in holograms, you only need one fragment\nto see the whole picture. Your brain has identified the tablecloth\nwith one from the past, maybe from your grandmother's house. However, instead of remembering\nthat you've seen it at your grandmother's, your brain has summoned up the old memory without identifying it. This leaves you stuck with familiarity,\nbut no recollection. Although you've never been\nin this restaurant, you've seen that tablecloth\nbut are just failing to identify it. Now, look at this fork. Are you paying attention? Our last theory is divided attention, and it states that déjà vu occurs when our brain subliminally\ntakes in an environment while we're distracted\nby one particular object. When our attention returns, we feel as if we've been here before. For example, just now\nyou focused on the fork and didn't observe the tablecloth\nor the falling waiter. Although your brain has been\nrecording everything in your peripheral vision, it's been doing so\nbelow conscious awareness. When you finally pull yourself\naway from the fork, you think you've been here before\nbecause you have, you just weren't paying attention. While all three of these theories\nshare the common features of déjà vu, none of them propose to be\nthe conclusive source of the phenomenon. Still, while we wait\nfor researchers and inventers to come up with new ways\nto capture this fleeting moment, we can study the moment ourselves. After all, most studies of déjà vu\nare based on first-hand accounts, so why can't one be yours? The next time you get déjà vu,\ntake a moment to think about it. Have you been distracted? Is there a familiar object somewhere? Is your brain just acting slow? Or is it something else?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the physical manifestations of déjà vu?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dizziness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ringing in the ears"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sneezing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does déjà vu mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Happened before"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Already seen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "From the past"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dream memory"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many theories of déjà vu are there?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Over 40"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which theory asserts that déjà vu occurs when there is a delay in information to your brian?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Double imaging"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Delayed Response"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hologram Theory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dual Processing"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The theory of divided attention asserts that our brain subliminally takes in an environment while we’re ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Distracted by an object"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Having a conversation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Listening to music"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Scratching our knees"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

After uttering this simple word, the common teacher is met with a mass of groans, moans, devastated looks, and the occasional chair tossed in his or her direction. But Shakespearean works are not boring, confusing, long and painful plays written more than 400 years ago. They're adventures relating to the extremities of human nature: love, hate, jealousy, zealous ambition, fear, mistrust, deception, and murder. We owe much of our own language to his invention. He invented over 2,000 words for use in his plays, which still remain in the Oxford English Dictionary. Words like \"countless\" and \"assassination\" as well as phrases like \"one fell swoop,\" \"foul play,\" and even \"to be in a pickle\" all originated from William's brilliant brain. And there are many echoes of Shakespeare's romantic language too. If you read Romeo and Juliet, you'll come across sentences like, \"She doth teach the torches to burn bright,\" and, \"So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows.\" Both are quite clever metaphors, suggesting that Juliet is both exceptionally beautiful and far moreso than anyone else. \"For thou art as glorious to this night, being o'er my head, as is a winged messenger of heaven,\" is a simile suggesting angelic qualities of the lady in question. This is not too different from today's comments like, \"Hey, beautiful!\" and, \"You're the hottest girl in the room.\" Shakespeare also uses slightly more complex metaphors to describe the intentions of a mischievous man. For instance, \"This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss,\" essentially means, \"I wish to kiss you.\" Such male intentions were not limited to simple pecks on the cheek either. An intentional ambiguity was often used as a cheeky means to proposition marriage or a more intimate relationship. Therefore, instead of viewing Shakespearean works as out-dated, boring, and unhelpful, start reading today and discover the best ways to get the one you love to love you back."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Shakespeare’s plays were written in the ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1500's and 1600's"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1100's and 1200's"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2000 BC"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1960's"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are the common student responses to Shakespearean plays in the 21st Century?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "crying, screaming and shouting"}, {"label": "B", "text": "groans, moans, devastated looks and chair throwing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "smiles, laughter and excitement"}, {"label": "D", "text": "‘a’ and ‘b’"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which phrase did Shakespeare not invent?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "foul play"}, {"label": "B", "text": "to be in a pickle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "you are as beautiful as this hour"}, {"label": "D", "text": "she doth teach the torches to burn bright"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "\"This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss\" means: _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "I wish to kiss you"}, {"label": "B", "text": "kissing is a sin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pilgrims kiss roughly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "everyone wants to kiss you"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which three poetic devices are used in the Shakespeare animation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "personification, metaphor, simile"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ambiguity, onomatopoeia and assonance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "alliteration, personification and metaphor"}, {"label": "D", "text": "metaphor, simile and complex metaphor"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

And also my right leg was several inches shorter than my left one. They broke the bones in the leg, then they screwed metal spikes into the bone. It has not only spikes, but wires that go all the way through the leg to stabilize it. I have to walk on it. I have to stretch it out so that my muscles don't just get all atrophied. People always ask me, \"Does it hurt?\" Yes, it does, but I focus on what I can do, not on what I cannot do. I want to talk with you guys about overcoming obstacles. Everybody has obstacles, a disability, a hurdle. We face a choice: Let the obstacle overcome you or overcome the obstacle. Maybe some of you have heard of Jim Abbott. He was a Major League baseball player. He won a gold metal in the Olympics. He played for the Yankees, the Angels. But he threw a no-hitter, and he only had one arm. When he was a kid, he came home mad one time and told his dad, \"The kids won't let me play baseball because I only have one hand.\" His dad replied, \"No, the kids won't let you play baseball because you stink at baseball. You can't change the fact that you only have one hand, but you can change the fact that you stink.\" So, his dad began to practice with him, and he got good. He overcame obstacles. Teams would try to exploit his weak side. They would try to bunt to the side that he had a missing arm. But they never succeeded because he practiced and practiced fielding bunts to that side. There's no dishonor in having a disability, and I won't let anyone diss my ability, but I don't want anyone's pity either. I will not use the obstacles I face as an excuse for having a pity party. I will practice harder, play harder, and push myself harder to keep getting better. Last season I started on my varsity high school basketball team as a freshman, and I won Rookie of the Year. I was one of the top scorers on the team. One of the things that I find funny is that people judge me by appearance. They say, \"Oh, look at this one-handed whitey with the limp. I don't want him on my team!\" But what they don't know is that I don't just have a disability, I have an ability. One of my favorite moments from this last season was we played a team that we had never played before. And when the game started, you could tell that they were dissing my disability. I mean, they double-teamed our tallest player. They just were playing really soft on me, and they just, you could tell they thought, \"What can this guy with one hand do?\" So, they left me open for a three. I made that one. They left me open for another one. I made that one. Then, they started to get frustrated, so they actually fouled me. I made both free throws. And they called time out. And as we were in the huddle, I could hear the other coach yelling at his players about me. They went from not covering me at all to double-teaming me. It's all about overcoming obstacles. It's true, I have a disability, but so do you. I also have an ability, so do you. Everyone has obstacles to overcome. Some are visible like mine. Some are less visible. Maybe your obstacle is that you come from a poor neighborhood. Maybe people say you'll never amount to anything. Prove them wrong. Maybe your obstacle is that you have a learning disability, and people think that you're dumb. Prove them wrong. Maybe people judge you because of the color of your skin or your family background. Prove them wrong. I know a lot of people who take one look at me and judge me. They say, \"Oh, that kid can't be any good at basketball.

Since the establishment of the United Nations, wars of aggression have been outlawed and multilateral conventions refer to armed conflict instead of war. But the wars of the future won't be like the wars of our past. Alongside traditional warfare, our future will include cyberwarfare, remotely fighting our enemies through the use of a new class of weapons, including computer viruses and programs to alter the enemy's ability to operate. And not only is cyberwarfare not covered by existing legal frameworks, but the question of what exactly constitutes cyberwarfare is still highly debated. So, how can we deal with cyberwarfare if we can't even agree on what it means? One way forward is to envision situations where new international laws may be needed. Imagine a new kind of assassin, one that could perpetrate a crime without firing a single shot or even being in the same country. For example, an individual working for the government uses a wireless device to send a signal to another foreign leader's pacemaker. This device directs the pacemaker to malfunction, ultimately resulting in the foreign leader's death. Would this cyber assassination constitute an act of war? As a second example, imagine an allied group of nations cooperatively infiltrating the computer systems of an enemy nation's nuclear warship. This attack results in a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier almost melting down, which was stopped just short of killing thousands of soldiers and civilians. As a defensive measure, the enemy country responds by unleashing a defensive cyberattack that results in the allied nations' power grids going down. Hospitals can no longer treat patients, entire regions without heat or clean water, all ultimately causing tens of thousands civilian deaths. The origin of the power failure was the counterattack, but the fragile infrastructure, feeble cybersecurity, and the antiquated state of the power grid all contributed to the deaths of the civilians. Could the country fight back? Who would they fight? And would their retaliation be considered an act of war? Do they constitute war crimes against humanity? Who is to be held responsible? The computer programmers who wrote the code? The military project manager who oversaw the creation of the code? The commander who hit the button, setting off the event? The hardware engineer who created the computers, knowing that they were intended to enable an attack? Because war has been with us for so long, we have laws to deal with figuring out who should be held accountable for their actions in combat. These legal frameworks aim to contain and prevent atrocities from being more atrocious. Commandeering civilian planes and using them as weapons, dropping atomic bombs, the use of gas chambers or poisonous gas in conflict, all of these actions, if committed, constitute acts of war and war crimes under customary international law and the Hague conventions. Again, the current legal framework stays silent on hypothetical questions and countless others because there are no easy answers, and there are only two ways to make progress on these questions: peace or new laws. So, what hypothetical but plausible scenarios can you imagine falling under the burgeoning definition of cyberwarfare, and how might you design an international legal framework to deter these activities?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many global cyberwarfare treatises exist today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "0"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "23"}, {"label": "E", "text": "107"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A cyber attack by a sovereign nation that takes down a city power grid constitutes an act of war.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The law is unclear"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the name of the UN rules of cyber engagement?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Law of War"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Geneva Conventions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hague Conventions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "International Humanitarian Law"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None exist"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Someone can be a cyberwar criminal and tried at the Hague.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The law is unclear"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Under US law a company can legally launch a defensive cyber attack against a sovereign nation after the company has been attacked.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The law is unclear"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 100, "lesson": 6, "title": "The Arctic vs. the Antarctic - Camille Seaman", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-arctic-vs-the-antarctic-camille-seaman", "transcript": {"en": "On our planet, we have two polar regions: the Arctic, whose name comes from the Greek Arktikos, of the North, and the Antarctic from Antarktikos, opposite of the North. But there's an easier way to remember them if you just remember what surrounds them. The Arctic, situated in the Northern hemisphere of our planet, is an ocean entirely surrounded by land. On the other side of the world, the Antarctic is a continent entirely surrounded by ocean. So, the Arctic has polar bears but no penguins, and the Antarctic has penguins but no polar bears. Let's talk about the Arctic first. The Arctic region consists of a vast, ice-covered ocean surrounded by treeless permafrost. The area can be defined as the region between the Arctic Circle and the North Pole. If you were to stand at the North Pole, everywhere you looked, in all directions, would be south. But standing at the North Pole is difficult to do for very long because it's in the middle of an ocean, covered by constantly shifting, frozen sea ice. If you were to fall into the water at the North Pole, you'd fall into water that's 13,980 feet deep. Above the water, average winter temperatures can be as low as -40 degrees Celsius, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately -68 degrees Celsius. Despite these incredibly harsh conditions, humans have populated areas in the Arctic for thousands of years. Life in the Arctic includes organisms living in the ice, zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants, and human societies. Okay, what about Antarctica? Antarctica is Earth's southernmost continent, and it contains the geographic South Pole. It's the fifth largest continent on the planet at nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost 98% of Anarctica is covered by ice at least one mile in thickness. Conditions in Antarctica are some of the most extreme in the entire world. On average, it's the coldest, windiest, driest continent and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. You might think that it snows all the time at the Poles, but Antarctica is so dry, it's considered a desert with annual precipitation of only 200 millimeters along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached -89 degrees Celsius. Because it's so harsh and hard to get to, there are no permanent human residents on Antarctica, but anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Even the most extreme animals fight for survival, and only cold-adapted organisms survive there, including many types of algae, animals, bacteria, fungi, plants, and protista. But why is Antarctica colder than its northern cousin? Well, first, much of the continent is more than three kilometers above sea level, and temperature decreases with elevation. That's why mountaintops have snow on them. Second, remember that the Arctic is really a frozen ocean. The water in the ocean beneath it is warmer than the frozen ground in the Antarctic, and that warmth is transferred through the ice pack. This prevents temperatures in the Arctic regions from reaching the extremes typical of the land surface of Antarctica. Third, the seasons are conspiring against the Antarctic. During the aphelion in July, when the Earth is the farthest away from the Sun, it also happens to be winter in the Antarctic, which creates a double-whammy of cold for the southern pole. But despite being inhospitable, the North and South Pole are a big reason why our planet is the way it is. Both of our polar regions are very important climate controllers.

From mistakes - Diana Laufenberg", "category": "Teaching & Education", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-learn-from-mistakes-diana-laufenberg", "transcript": {"en": "I have been teaching for a long time and in doing so have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning that I really wish more people would understand about the potential of students in 1931 my grandmother bottom left for you guys over here graduated from the eighth grade she went to school to get the information because that's where the information lived it was in the books it was inside the teacher's head and she needed to go there to get the information because that's how you learned fast forwarded generation this is the one-room schoolhouse Oak Grove my father went to a one-room schoolhouse and he again had to travel to the school to get the information from the teacher stored in the only portable memory he has which is inside his own head and take it with him because that is how information was being transported from teacher to student and then used in the world when I was a kid we had a set of encyclopedias at my house it was purchased the year I was born and it was extraordinary because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information the information was inside my house and it was awesome this was different than either generation had experienced before and it changed the way I interacted with information even at just a small level but the information was closer to me I could get access to it in the time that passes between when I was a kid in high school and when I started teaching we really see the advent of the internet right about the time that the internet gets going as an educational tool I take off from Wisconsin and move to Kansas small town Kansas where I had an opportunity to teach in a lovely small town rural Kansas School District where I was teaching my favorite subject American government my first year super gung-ho going to teach American government love the political system kids in the 12th grade not exactly all that enthusiastic about the American government system you're too learned a few things had to change my tactic and I put in front of them an authentic experience that allowed them to learn for themselves I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it I posed a problem in front of them which was to put on an election form for their own community they produced fliers they called offices they check schedules they were meeting with secretaries they produced an election form booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates they invited everyone into the school for an evening of conversation about government and politics and you know whether or not the streets were done well and really had this robust experiential learning the older teachers more experienced looked at me and went oh there she is that's so cute she's trying to get that done she doesn't know what she's in for but I knew that the kids would show up and I and I believed it and I told them every week um what I expected out of them and that night all 90 kids dressed appropriately doing their job owning it I had to just sit and watch it was theirs it was experiential it was authentic it meant something to them and they will step up from Kansas I moved on to lovely Arizona where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years this time with middle school students luckily I didn't have to teach them American government could teach the more exciting topic of geography and again thrilled to learn but what was interesting about this position I found myself in in Arizona was I had this really extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with in a truly public school and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities and one opportunity was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina which is the gentleman that the movie Hotel Rwanda is based after and he was going to speak at the high school next door to us we could walk there we didn't even have to pay for the buses there was no expense cost perfect field trip the problem then becomes how do you take seventh and eighth graders to a talk about genocide and deal with the subject in a way that is responsible and respectful and they know what to do with it and so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina as an example of a gentleman who singularly used his life to do something positive I then challenged the kids to identify someone in their own life or in their own story or in their own world that they could identify that had done a similar thing I asked them to produce a little movie about it first time we've done this nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer but they were into it and I to put their own voice over it it was the most awesome moment of Revelation that when you ask kids to use their own voice and ask them to speak for themselves what they're willing to share the last question of the assignment is how do you plan to use your life to positively impact other people the things that kids will say when you ask them and take the time to listen is extraordinary fast-forward to Pennsylvania where I find myself today I teach at the science Leadership Academy which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute and the School District of Philadelphia we are a nine through twelve public school but we do school quite differently I moved there primarily to be part of a learning environment that validated the way that I knew that kids learn and that really wanted to investigate what was possible when you were willing to kind of let go of some of the paradigms of the past of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school and when my father was in school and even when I was in school into a moment where we have information surplus and so what do you do when the information is all around you why do you have kids come to school if they no longer have to come there to get the information in Pennsylvania we have in Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program so the kids are bringing in laptops with them every day taking them home getting access to information and here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with when you've given the tool to acquire information to students is that you have to be comfortable with this idea of allowing kids to fail as part of the learning process we deal right now in the educational landscape with an it just an infatuation with the culture of one right answer that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple-choice test and I am here to share with you it is not learning that is the absolute wrong thing to ask to tell kids to never be wrong to ask them to always have the right answer doesn't allow them to learn so we did this project and this is one of the artifacts of the project I almost never show them off because of the issue of the idea of failure my students produce these infographics as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year responding to the oil spill I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing of the infographics that existed you know in a lot of mass media and take a look at what were the interesting components of it and produce one for themselves of a different man-made disaster from American history and they had certain criteria to do it they were a little uncomfortable with it because we never done this before and they didn't know exactly how to do it they can talk they are very smooth and they can write very very well but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way was a little uncomfortable for them but I gave them the room to just do the thing go create go figure it out let's let's see what we can do and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint this was done in like two or three days and this is the work of the student that consistently did it when I sat the students down I said who's got the best one and they immediately went there it is didn't read anything there it is and I said well what makes it great in there like oh the design is good and he's using good color and they're submitting it and they went through all of we processed out loud and I said go read it and they're like Oh Alan that one wasn't so awesome and then we went to another one he didn't have good visuals but had great information and spent an hour talking about the learning process because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect or whether or not it was what I could create it asked them to create for themselves and it allowed them to fail process learn from and when we do another round of this in my class this year they will do better this time because learning has to include amount and amount of failure because failure is instructional in the process there are a million pictures that I could click through here and had to choose carefully this is one of my favourites of students learning of what learning can look like in a landscape where we let go of the idea that kids have to come to school to get the information but instead ask them what they can do with it ask some really interesting questions they will not disappoint ask them to go to places to see things for themselves to actually experience the learning to play to inquire this is one of my favorite photos because this was taken on Tuesday when I asked the students to go to the polls this is Robbie and this was his first day of voting and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that but this is learning too because we asked them to go out into real spaces the main point is that if we continue to look at education as if it's about coming to school to get the information and not about experiential learning empowering student voice and embracing failure we're missing the mark and everything that everybody is talking about today isn't possible if we keep having an educational system that does not value these qualities because we won't get there with a standardized test and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer we know how to do this better and it's time to do better"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does Diana say was important about having an encyclopedia in her home?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She had close access to information"},

"transcript": {"en": "hello my name is Bert Baer and I'm 11 years old I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system first of all I would like to say that I'm really amazed how easily kids rolla to believe all the marketing advertising on TV at public schools and pretty much everywhere else you look it seems to me like corporations are always trying to get kids like me to get their parents to buy stuff that really isn't good for us or the planet little kids especially are attracted by colorful packaging and plastic toys I must admit I used to be one of them I also used to think that all of our food came from these happy little farms where pigs rolled in mud and cows graze on grass all day what I discovered was this is not true I began to look into the stuff on the internet in books and in documentary films in my travels with my family I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system first there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms that is what seed is manipulated in a laboratory to do something not in tune by nature like taking the DNA of fish and putting it into the DNA of a tomato yuck don't get me wrong I like fish and tomatoes but this is just creepy the seeds the seeds our complaintant then grow the food they produce an improvement cost cancer and other problems of lab animals and people have been eat food produced this way since the 1990s most folks don't even know they exist did you know rats fed genetically engineered corn had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity these include kidney inflammation and lesions in the crease kidney wait yeah almost all the corn wheat has been altered in ethically in some way and let me tell you corn isn't everything and don't even get me started on the confined animal feeding operations called K flows conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers made from fossil fuels they mix with the dirt to make plants grow they do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients from growing the same crop over and over again next more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables like pesticides and herbicides to kill weeds and bugs when it rains these chemicals seep into the ground or run up into our waterways poisoning our water too then they are radiates our food trying to make it last longer so it can travel thousands of miles from what's grown to the supermarkets so I ask myself how can I change how can I change these things this is what I found out I discovered that there's a movement for a better way now while back I wanted to be an NFL football player I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead and that way I can have a greater impact on the world this man Joel Salatin they call him a lunatic farmer because he grows against the system since I'm homeschooled I want to go here speak one day this man this lunatic farmer doesn't use any pesticides herbicides or genetically modified seeds and so for that he's called crazy by the system I want you to know that we can all make a difference by making different choices by buying our food directly from local farmers or neighbors we know in real life some people say organic or local food is more expensive but is it really with all these things I've been learning about the food system it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital I know now I know definitely which one I would choose I want you to know that there are farms out there I built here and so qua Chico's farms in Tennessee whose cows do t grass and his pigs do own the mug just like I thought sometimes I got to Bill's farm and volunteer so I can see up close and personal where the meat comes from I want you to know that I believe kids wheat fresh vegetables and good food ethic nor more about it and her really comes from I want you to know that there are farmers markets in every community popping up I want you to know that me my brother and sister actually like eating baked kale chips I try to share this everywhere I go not too long ago my uncle said that he offered my six year old cousin cereal he asked if he wanted organic touch the O's or the sugar-coated flakes you know the one of the big stripe and cartoon character on the front my little cousin told his dad that he would rather have the organic touch with Oh cereal because Burke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal and that my friends is how we can make a difference one K at a time so next time you're at the grocery store think local choose organic know your font and know your food you"},

{"page": 100, "lesson": 9, "title": "The science of macaroni salad: What's in a molecule? - Josh Kurz", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-macaroni-salad-what-s-in-a-molecule-josh-kurz", "transcript": {"en": "We already know that the world is made of things, things like cats and macaroni salad, and macaroni salad is made of things like mayo and mustard and celery, which are all made of molecules. As we'll see, these molecules are made of the same stuff, just mixed together in different ways. Let's go back to our macaroni salad. We've already unmixed things physically as much as we can. Now, we'll go further and unmix things chemically by breaking some bonds. Many larger, complex molecules are just a bunch of smaller molecules bonded together like building blocks. Here, again, macaroni salad provides a nice example. If you look at the pasta, you'll notice it's made of a lot of this stuff, starch, which is this molecule, otherwise known as amylose. Turns out, if you break some bonds, amylose is made up of smaller molecules of glucose, a simple sugar. If you take a bunch of these same glucose molecules and rearrange them in a different way, you get cellulose, which is what plants are made of. So, while this piece of pasta made of amylose and this wooden spoon made of cellulose look vastly different, they're both essentially made of the same molecules, just stuck together differently. This type of breaking apart and recombining is what goes on when you digest food. The complex proteins found in the foods we eat, like carrots and eggs, can't be used by our bodies because we are not carrots or chickens. What we can use are the smaller molecules that make up these proteins, the amino acids. During digestion, our bodies break these proteins up into their amino acids so they can be rearranged and put back together to make human proteins. But let's keep breaking bonds. All molecules are made up of atoms bonded together. If some molecules are building blocks, atoms are the building blocks of the building blocks. And you'll notice that with the molecules from macaroni salad, the same six types of atoms keep showing up: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur, or CHONPS. There's a few others, but the big six is what macaroni salad is made of. If we went a step further, we could use these same atoms, recombine them, and make other stuff like gasoline or sulfuric acid, methane, and nylon. It's all made from the same elements that make up macaroni salad. So, to recap, everything is made of atoms. They are the stuff that things are made of. Atoms are grouped together in different ways to form molecules. These molecules are constantly being combined, broken apart, and recombined. They get thrown into mixtures, separated, remixed over and over and over again. The stuff that things are made of is always in flux; it's always changing. Macaroni salad is only macaroni salad for a short time. You eat it, some of it becomes part of you, the rest eventually goes into the ocean and gets eaten by other animals that die, and after millions of years, they turn into oil, which is where gasoline comes from. And that's why gasoline and macaroni salad are not that different - they're both made of the same stuff, just one tastes better."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Many larger complex molecules are just ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Random bits of chemical information that scientists don't really understand"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Smaller molecules bonded together like building blocks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Change their chemical composition randomly, but on a consistent basis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Are unique to macaroni salad (that's why we're using it as an example), and can exist nowhere else in the world"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which is the starch molecule?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Amylose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Framtrose"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Maltose"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hydrolase"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Humans can't use the large molecules in proteins but can use _________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The complex carbohydrates found in all proteins"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tools, like the wrench and the jigsaw, in order to aide digestion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A auto filtration system evolved over billions of years to help us filter out all the parts of proteins we can't use"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The amino acids that make up the proteins"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Atoms are the ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Combination of one or more molecules"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Building blocks of the building blocks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Components of proteins the body has to use in order to derive the proper nutrition from the food it digests"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Best thing man ever invented"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which is not an atom that repeatedly shows up in macaroni salad?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carbon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nitrogen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Phosphorus"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of these repeatedly show up"}, {"label": "F", "text": "None of these repeatedly show up"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 100, "lesson": 10, "title": "Should you trust your first impression? - Peter Mende-Siedlecki", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/should-you-trust-your-first-impression-peter-mende-siedlecki", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine you're at a football game when this obnoxious guy sits next to you. He's loud, he spills his drink on you, and he makes fun of your team. Days later, you're walking in the park when suddenly it starts to pour rain. Who should show up at your side to offer you an umbrella? The same guy from the football game. Do you change your mind about him based on this second encounter, or do you go with your first impression and write him off? Research in social psychology suggests that we're quick to form lasting impressions of others based on their behaviors. We manage to do this with little effort, inferring stable character traits from a single behavior, like a harsh word or a clumsy step. Using our impressions as guides, we can accurately predict how people are going to behave in the future. Armed with the knowledge the guy from the football game was a jerk the first time you met him, you might expect more of the same down the road. If so, you might choose to avoid him the next time you see him. That said, we can change our impressions in light of new information. Behavioral researchers have identified consistent patterns that seem to guide this process of impression updating. On one hand, learning very negative, highly immoral information about someone typically has a stronger impact than learning very positive, highly moral information. So, unfortunately for our new friend from the football game, his bad behavior at the game might outweigh his good behavior at the park. Research suggests that this bias occurs because immoral behaviors are more diagnostic, or revealing, of a person's true character. Okay, so by this logic, bad is always stronger than good when it comes to updating. Well, not necessarily. Certain types of learning don't seem to lead to this sort of negativity bias. When learning about another person's abilities and competencies, for instance, this bias flips. It's actually the positive information that gets weighted more heavily. Let's go back to that football game. If a player scores a goal, it ultimately has a stronger impact on your impression of their skills than if they miss the net. The two sides of the updating story are ultimately quite consistent. Overall, behaviors that are perceived as being less frequent are also the ones that people tend to weigh more heavily when forming and updating impressions, highly immoral actions and highly competent actions. So, what's happening at the level of the brain when we're updating our impressions? Using fMRI, or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, researchers have identified an extended network of brain regions that respond to new information that's inconsistent with initial impressions. These include areas typically associated with social cognition, attention, and cognitive control. Moreover, when updating impressions based on people's behaviors, activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and the superior temporal sulcus correlates with perceptions of how frequently those behaviors occur in daily life. In other words, the brain seems to be tracking low-level, statistical properties of behavior in order to make complex decisions regarding other people's character. It needs to decide is this person's behavior typical or is it out of the ordinary? In the situation with the obnoxious-football-fan-turned-good-samaritan, your brain says, \"Well, in my experience, pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella, but the way this guy acted at the football game, that was unusual.\" And so, you decide to go with your first impression. There's a good moral in this data: your brain, and by extension you, might care more about the very negative, immoral things another person has done compared to the very positive, moral things, but it's a direct result of the comparative rarity of those bad behaviors. We're more used to people being basically good, like taking time to help a stranger in need. In this context, bad might be stronger than good, but only because good is more plentiful. Think about the last time you judged someone based on their behavior, especially a time when you really feel like you changed your mind about someone. Was the behavior that caused you to update your impression something you'd expect anyone to do, or was it something totally out of the ordinary?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Research suggests that when learning about someone’s abilities, positive information is ______, compared to negative information.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less diagnostic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "More diagnostic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Equally diagnostic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Not diagnostic"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Research suggests that when learning about someone’s morality, positive information is ______ as compared to negative information.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less diagnostic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "More diagnostic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Equally diagnostic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Not diagnostic"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When forming and updating impressions of other people, we tend to give more weight to behaviors that are ___________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Statistically common"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Negative in character"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Relatively predictable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Perceived as being less frequent"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When updating impressions based on people’s behaviors, activity in ____________ correlates with perceptions of how frequently those behaviors occur in daily life.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and cerebellum"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and superior temporal sulcus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Amygdala and fusiform cortex"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Researchers have used ________ to investigate the brain regions involved in impression updating.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "EEG"}, {"label": "B", "text": "PET scans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Single-unit recordings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "fMRI"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

A video game is an electronic game that has an interface designed for human interaction on a video device. Simple. Video games are used by scientists, the military, and people like you, and their evolution has spread across arcades, consoles, computers, smart phones, and all kinds of other electronics. These days video games are everywhere, but they were actually made in science labs. In fact, the earliest U.S. video game patent on record was in 1948, and at the time it was referred to as a cathode-ray tube amusement device. That's a mouthful! Some of the earliest video games include the Nimrod computer, OXO, Tennis for Two, and my personal favorite, Spacewar! But none of these early video games were ever sold to the public because they were either too huge or too expensive to get out of the lab. This all changed when a man named Ralph Baer looked at his television screen and wondered how else it might be used. In 1972, Baer's idea to get video games out of the science lab and into the living room led to the release of a game console called Odyssey. Odyssey allowed you to play a game on your TV. At about the same time, two other people, Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney, were working on something similar in a little company called Atari. You might have heard of it, and even if you haven't, I'm sure that your Dad has. Atari's first major game release was in 1972, an arcade game called Pong. It was an immediate hit, and it's credited as the first commercially successful video game. Atari then released a home version of Pong in 1974. By 1978, competition between Atari and another game company called Midway was heating up. Midway had licensed an arcade game for the Japanese company, Taito, that put them on the map. The game: Space Invaders. It featured iconic actors, like me, and it went on to become the second highest selling arcade game of all time. Space Invaders also helped kick off what is known as the Golden Age of Arcade Games. In response, Atari followed with the release of the arcade game Asteroids, which ranked sixth on the list of highest selling arcade games. It was a good game, but it's no Space Invaders. By 1980, color came to arcade games, and this was also the year that another video gaming milestone was born. Pac-Man, created by the Japanese company Namco, was brought to the U.S. by Midway. Important to the spread of video games into popular culture, Pac-Man was a character that could be licensed. It wasn't long before it had a song on the charts, a Saturday morning television show, and all sorts of other products. In just a year, Pac-Man arcade games made over one billion dollars in quarters. Then, in 1981, a company called Nintendo started making waves in the U.S. video game market with their release of Donkey Kong. It was the earliest video game to have a story line. The story went a bit like this: Donkey Kong is the pet of a carpenter named Jumpman. Jumpman mistreats his pet ape, so the ape steals his girlfriend, leaving the game player to assume the role of Jumpman and rescue the girl. Jumpman was eventually renamed to Mario. Other iconic arcade games from the early 80s include Frogger, Dragon's Lair, and Mario Brothers. Perhaps the last iconic game considered to be part of the Golden Age of Arcade Games is Double Dragon. It was the first really successful example of the beat-them-up genre. It was released in 1987, and, like Donkey Kong, it featured a damsel in distress storyline, a storyline common in many video games. By the mid-90s, the Golden Age of Arcade Games was coming to an end, and the home game console was gaining in popularity. While arcade games continued to decline in sales over the years, the popularity of video games was merely beginning, and we'll talk about that and a lot more in part two of a brief history of video games."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who uses video games?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Scientists"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Military"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People like you and me"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "________, the inventor of the first game console, is also known as the father of video games.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ralph Baer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elon Musk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nikola Tesla"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fusajiro Yamauchi"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In 1972, the very first home video game console called _______ was released.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Atari"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Odyssey"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pong"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nintendo"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Pac-Man arcade game earned revenue of over ________ during the first year of its release", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "$24"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$1 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$1 billion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$100 billion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Damsel in distress is a very common storyline in video games.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

My name is Art Benjamin,\nand I am a \"mathemagician.\" What that means is, I combine\nmy loves of math and magic to do something I call \"mathemagics.\" But before I get started, I have\na quick question for the audience. By any chance, did anyone happen to bring with them\nthis morning a calculator? Seriously, if you have a calculator\nwith you, raise your hand. Raise your hand. Did your hand go up? Now bring it out, bring it out.\nAnybody else? I see, I see one way in the back. You sir, that's three. And anybody on this side here? OK, over there on the aisle. Would the four of you\nplease bring out your calculators, then join me up on stage. Let's give them a nice round of applause. (Applause) That's right. Now, since I haven't had the chance\nto work with these calculators, I need to make sure\nthat they are all working properly. Would somebody get us started by giving us\na two-digit number, please? How about a two-digit number? Audience: 22. AB: 22. And another two-digit number, sir? Audience: 47. AB: Multiply 22 times 47,\nmake sure you get 1,034, or the calculators are not working. Do all of you get 1,034? 1,034? Volunteer: No. AB: 594. Let's give three of them\na nice round of applause there. (Applause) Would you like to try a more\nstandard calculator, just in case? OK, great. What I'm going to try and do then -- I notice it took some of you\na little bit of time to get your answer. That's OK. I'll give you a shortcut for multiplying\neven faster on the calculator. There is something called\nthe square of a number, which most of you know is taking a number\nand multiplying it by itself. For instance, five squared would be? Audience: 25. AB: 25. The way we can\nsquare on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number, such as five, hitting \"times\" and then \"equals,\" and on most calculators\nthat will give you the square. On some of these ancient RPN calculators, you've got an \"x squared\" button on it, will allow you to do\nthe calculation even faster. What I'm going to try and do\nnow is to square, in my head, four two-digit numbers faster than they can do\non their calculators, even using the shortcut method. What I'll use is the second row this time, and I'll get four of you to each yell out a two-digit number, and if you would square the first number, and if you would square the second,\nthe third and the fourth, I will try and race you to the answer. OK? So quickly, a two-digit number please. Audience: 37. Arthur Benjamin: 37 squared, OK. Audience: 23. AB: 23 squared, OK. Audience: 59. AB: 59 squared, OK, and finally? Audience: 93. AB: 93 squared. Would you call out your answers, please? Volunteer: 1369.\nAB: 1369. Volunteer: 529.\nAB: 529. Volunteer: 3481.\nAB: 3481. Volunteer: 8649. AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Let me try to take this one step further. I'm going to try to square\nsome three-digit numbers this time. I won't even write these down -- I'll just call them out\nas they're called out to me. Anyone I point to, call out\na three-digit number. Anyone on our panel, verify the answer. Just give some indication if it's right. A three-digit number, sir, yes? Audience: 987. AB: 987 squared is 974,169. (Laughter) AB: Yes? Good. Another three-digit -- (Applause) -- another three-digit number, sir? Audience: 457. AB: 457 squared is 205,849. 205,849? AB: Yes? OK, another, another\nthree-digit number, sir? Audience: 321. AB: 321 is 103,041. 103,041. Yes? One more three-digit number please. Audience: Oh, 722. AB: 722 is 500, that's a harder one. Is that 513,284? Volunteer: Yes. AB: Yes? Oh, one more, one more\nthree-digit number please. Audience: 162. 162 squared is 26,244. Volunteer: Yes. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me try to take this one step further. (Laughter) I'm going to try to square\na four-digit number this time. You can all take your time on this; I will not beat you\nto the answer on this one, but I will try to get the answer right. To make this a little bit more random,\nlet's take the fourth row this time, let's say, one, two, three, four. If each of you would call out\na single digit between zero and nine, that will be the four-digit\nnumber that I'll square. Nine. Seven. Five. Eight. 9,758, this will take me a little bit\nof time, so bear with me. 95 million -- (Sighs) 218,564? Volunteer: Yes! AB: Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) Now, I would attempt to square\na five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately,\nmost calculators cannot. (Laughter) Eight-digit capacity --\ndon't you hate that? So, since we've reached\nthe limits of our calculators -- what's that? Does yours go higher? Volunteer: I don't know. AB: Oh, yours does? Volunteer: I can probably do it.\nAB: I'll talk to you later. In the meanwhile, let me conclude the first part of my show by doing\nsomething a little trickier. Let's take the largest number\non the board here, 8649. Would you each enter\nthat on your calculator? And instead of squaring it this time, I want you to take\nthat number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want, but don't tell me\nwhat you're multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random\nthree-digit number. So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably\na seven-digit number. How many digits do you have, six or seven? Seven, and yours? Seven? Seven? And, uncertain. Seven. Is there any possible way\nthat I could know what seven-digit numbers you have? Say \"No.\" (Laughter) Good, then I shall attempt\nthe impossible -- or at least the improbable. What I'd like each of you\nto do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits,\nany six of them, in any order you'd like. (Laughter) One digit at a time, I shall try and determine\nthe digit you've left out. Starting with your seven-digit number, call out any six of them please. Volunteer: 1, 9, 7, 0, 4, 2. AB: Did you leave out the number 6? Good, OK, that's one. You have a seven-digit number,\ncall out any six of them please. Volunteer: 4, 4, 8, 7, 5. I think I only heard five numbers.\nI -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6? Same as she did, OK. You've got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear. Volunteer: 0, 7, 9, 0, 4, 4. I think you left out the number 3? AB: That's three. The odds of me getting\nall four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000:\n10 to the fourth power. OK, any six of them. (Laughter) Really scramble them up this time, please. Volunteer: 2, 6, 3, 9, 7, 2. Did you leave out the number 7? And let's give all four of these people\na nice round of applause. Thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) For my next number -- (Laughter) while I mentally recharge my batteries, I have one more question for the audience. By any chance, does anybody\nhere happen to know the day of the week\nthat they were born on? If you think you know\nyour birth day, raise your hand. Let's see, starting with --\nlet's start with a gentleman first. What year was it, first of all? That's why I pick a gentleman first. Audience: 1953. 1953, and the month? November what? 23rd -- was that a Monday? Audience: Yes. Good. Somebody else? I haven't seen any women's hands up. OK, how about you, what year? 1949, and the month? October what? Fifth -- was that a Wednesday? Yes! I'll go way to the back\nright now, how about you? Yell it out, what year? Audience: 1959. 1959, OK -- and the month? Audience: February. February what? Sixth -- was that a Friday?\nAudience: Yes. Good, how about the person behind her? Call out, what year was it? Audience: 1947.\nAB: 1947, and the month? Audience: May.\nAB: May what? Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday? Audience: Yes.\nAB: Thank you very much. (Applause) Anybody here who'd like to know\nthe day of the week they were born? We can do it that way. Of course, I could just make up\nan answer and you wouldn't know, so I come prepared for that. I brought with me a book of calendars. It goes as far back into the past as 1800,\nbecause you never know. (Laughter) I didn't mean to look at you, sir --\nyou were just sitting there. (Laughter) Anyway, Chris, you can help me\nout here, if you wouldn't mind. This is a book of calendars. Who wanted to know their birth day? What year was it, first of all? Audience: 1966. 66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966. And what month? Audience: April.\nAB: April what? Audience: 17th. I believe that was a Sunday. Can you confirm, Chris? Chris Anderson: Yes. AB: I'll tell you what, Chris: as long as you have\nthat book in front of you, do me a favor, turn to a year\noutside of the 1900s, either into the 1800s\nor way into the 2000s -- that'll be a much greater\nchallenge for me. AB: What year would you like?\nCA: 1824. AB: 1824, OK. AB: And what month? CA: June. AB: June what?\nCA: Sixth. AB: Was that a Sunday? CA: It was.\nAB: And it was cloudy. (Laughter) Good, thank you very much. (Applause) (Applause ends) But I'd like to wrap things up now by alluding to something\nfrom earlier in the presentation. There was a gentleman up here\nwho had a 10-digit calculator. Where is he, would you stand up, 10-digit guy? OK, stand up for me just for a second, so I can see where you are. You have a 10-digit calculator,\nsir, as well? OK, what I'm going to try\nand do, is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring\na 10-digit calculator. But to make my job more interesting\nfor you, as well as for me, I'm going to do this problem\nthinking out loud. So you can actually, honestly hear what's going on in my mind\nwhile I do a calculation of this size. Now, I have to apologize\nto our magician friend Lennart Green. I know as a magician we're not supposed\nto reveal our secrets, but I'm not too afraid that people are going to start\ndoing my show next week, so -- I think we're OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So, let's see, let's take a different row of people,\nstarting with you. I'll get five digits:\none, two, three, four. Oh, I did this row already. Let's do the row before you, starting with you:\none, two, three, four, five. Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number\nthat I will try to square, go ahead. Five. Seven. Six. Eight. Three. 57,683 -- squared. Yuck. Let me explain to you\nhow I'm going to attempt this problem. I'm going to break the problem\ndown into three parts. I'll do 57,000 squared, plus 683 squared, plus 57,000 times 683 times two. Add all those numbers together, and with any luck, arrive at the answer. Now, let me recap. (Laughter) Thank you. (Laughter) While I explain something else -- (Laughter) -- I know, that you can use, right? (Laughter) While I do these calculations, you might hear certain words, as opposed to numbers,\ncreep into the calculation. Let me explain what that is. This is a phonetic code, a mnemonic device that I use, that allows me to convert\nnumbers into words. I store them as words, and later on\nretrieve them as numbers. I know it sounds complicated; it's not. I don't want you to think you're seeing\nsomething out of \"Rain Man.\" (Laughter) There's definitely\na method to my madness -- definitely, definitely. Sorry. (Laughter) If you want to talk to me\nabout ADHD afterwards, you can talk to me then. By the way, one last instruction, for my judges with the calculators -- you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance\nthat I will make a mistake here. If I do, don't tell me\nwhat the mistake is; just say, \"you're close,\"\nor something like that, and I'll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty\nentertaining in itself. If, however, I am right, whatever you do,\ndon't keep it to yourself, OK? (Laughter) Make sure everybody knows\nthat I got the answer right, because this is my big finish, OK. So, without any more stalling, here we go. I'll start the problem\nin the middle, with 57 times 683. 57 times 68 is 3,400, plus 476 is 3876, that's 38,760 plus 171, 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931. 38,931; double that to get 77,862. 77,862 becomes cookie fission, cookie fission is 77,822. That seems right, I'll go on.\nCookie fission, OK. Next, I do 57 squared,\nwhich is 3,249, so I can say, three billion. Take the 249, add that to cookie, 249, oops, but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie, 250 plus 77, is 327 million -- fission, fission, OK,\nfinally, we do 683 squared, that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared is 466,489, rev up if I need it, rev up, take the 466, add that to fission, to get, oh gee -- 328,489. Audience: Yeah!\nAB: Good. Thank you very much. (Applause) I hope you enjoyed mathemagics. Thank you.

It's called the yin-yang symbol. It comes from Taoism, a religion born in China and it has far more meaning than you probably realize. The yin is the dark swirl, and the yang is the light one, and each side has a dot of the opposite color, which gives a clue to the meaning of yin and yang. Everything contains the seed of its opposite. Darth Vadar has the seed of goodness, and Luke has the potential to follow his father to the dark side. Like Luke and his father, yin and yang are not total opposites, they are relative to each other. Taoists believe that the universe is made up of energies, vibrations, and matter, which behave differently in different contexts. Something can be yin or yang depending on, well, depending on lots of things. So, while wheat that's growing is yang, when it's being reaped, it's yin. A wave's crest is yang, and the trough is yin. Villages on the sunny side of a valley in China have names like Liuyang or Shiyang, but on the shady side, for example, of the Yangtze River Valley, there's Jiangyin. The brake is yin to the gas pedal's yang. An eggshell is yang, the egg inside is yin. You think you're getting it? Yang is harder, stronger, brighter, and faster, but one can turn into the other or are two sides of the same coin. The sunbeams are yang in comparison to the shadows. The pitch is yang, the catch is yin. The yang starts an action, and the yin receives it, completes it. Yin is the inside space of a cup; it wouldn't be a cup without it. Yang is the cup. The coffee's heat, however, is yang, and its blackness is yin. Yang goes berserk sometimes, but there's some very powerful yins, too, if they don't quite go berserk. Yin is the darker swirl, the female, but there is a white dot in it. And yang is the lighter, the male, but it has a black dot. Water flowing calmly in a river is yin, but when it goes over the waterfall, it's very yang. Toothpicks are yin compared with a telephone pole. The back of a person is more yang than the front. The top of a person is the yang end. Taoism teaches that there is a power in the universe. It's higher, deeper, and truer than any other force. They call it the Tao. It means the way. Like the Force in Star Wars, the Tao has two sides. Unlike other religions where the higher power is all good, and perhaps has an all-evil rival, Taoism teaches that we need to learn from both yin and yang. And unlike religions with gods that are personal, the higher power in Taoism is not. Taoists believe that living in harmony with the way, a person will not have to fight against the universe's natural flow. So, for example, listen more, argue less. Be ready to back up or undo something, and you will make even faster progress. Don't worry about being the best, be who you are. Live simply. Complications take you away from the Tao. \"The wise person is flexible,\" Taoists say. Learning to use the Tao is what Taoism is all about, and that's why you should know your yin from your yang."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is on the yang side of a person:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Feet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Internal organs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Shadow"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Head"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which part of a teacup is most yin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the cup itself"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the space inside the cup"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the hot tea being poured into the cup"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the hand of a person grasping the cup"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In Daoism, the Higher Power is not a God, but", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is a force permeating the universe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The natural flow of all things"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A path which people ought to follow"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Compared to a person with too much yin energy, a person with too much yang energy would probably", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Be calm and thoughtful"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Be very relaxed and flexible"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rush into things more often"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Be receptive and patient"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "You should know your yin from your yang because", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Every aspect of our lives ought to be balanced"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yin is bad and yang is good"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Yin is good and yang is bad"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The more yang you can accumulate, the wealthier you will become"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 100, "lesson": 14, "title": "What's the definition of comedy? Banana. - Addison Anderson", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-the-definition-of-comedy-banana-addison-anderson", "transcript": {"en": "What's the definition of comedy? Thinkers and philosophers from Plato and Aristotle to Hobbes, Freud, and beyond, including anyone misguided enough to try to explain a joke, have pondered it, and no one has settled it. You're lucky you found this video to sort it out. To define comedy, you should first ask why it seems comedy defies definition. The answer's simple. Comedy is the defiance of definition because definitions sometimes need defiance. Consider definition itself. When we define, we use language to set borders around a thing that we've perceived in the whirling chaos of existence. We say what the thing means and fit that in a system of meanings. Chaos becomes cosmos. The universe is translated into a cosmological construct of knowledge. And let's be honest, we need some logical cosmic order, otherwise we'd have pure chaos. Chaos can be rough, so we build a thing that we call reality. Now think about logic and logos, that tight knot connecting a word and truth. And let's jump back to thinking about what's funny, because some people say it's real simple: truth is funny. It's funny because it's true. But that's simplistic. Plenty of lies are funny. Comedic fiction can be funny. Made-up nonsense jibberish is frequently hilarious. For instance, florp -- hysterical! And plenty of truths aren't funny. Two plus two truly equals four, but I'm not laughing just because that's the case. You can tell a true anecdote, but your date may not laugh. So, why are some untruths and only some truths funny? How do these laughable truths and untruths relate to that capital-T Truth, the cosmological reality of facts and definitions? And what makes any of them funny? There's a Frenchman who can help, another thinker who didn't define comedy because he expressly didn't want to. Henri Bergson's a French philosopher who prefaced his essay on laughter by saying he wouldn't define \"the comic\" because it's a living thing. He argued laughter has a social function to destroy mechanical inelasticity in people's attitudes and behavior. Someone doing the same thing over and over, or building up a false image of themself and the world, or not adapting to reality by just noticing the banana peel on the ground -- this is automatism, ignorance of one's own mindless rigidity, and it's dangerous but also laughable and comic ridicule helps correct it. The comic is a kinetic, vital force, or elan vital, that helps us adapt. Bergson elaborates on this idea to study what's funny about all sorts of things. But let's stay on this. At the base of this concept of comedy is contradiction between vital, adaptive humanity and dehumanized automatism. A set system that claims to define reality might be one of those dehumanizing forces that comedy tends to destroy. Now, let's go back to Aristotle. Not Poetics, where he drops a few thoughts on comedy, no, Metaphysics, the fundamental law of non-contradiction, the bedrock of logic. Contradictory statements are not at the same time true. If A is an axiomatic statement, it can't be the case that A and the opposite of A are both true. Comedy seems to live here, to subsist on the illogic of logical contradiction and its derivatives. We laugh when the order we project on the world is disrupted and disproven, like when the way we all act contradicts truths we don't like talking about, or when strange observations we all make in the silent darkness of private thought are dragged into public by a good stand-up, and when cats play piano, because cats that are also somehow humans disrupt our reality. So, we don't just laugh at truth, we laugh at the pleasurable, edifying revelation of flaws, incongruities, overlaps, and outright conflicts in the supposedly ordered system of truths we use to define the world and ourselves. When we think too highly of our thinking, when we think things are true just because we all say they're logos and stop adapting, we become the butt of jokes played on us by that wacky little trickster, chaos.

They'll just shake it off and walk on. Sometimes that happens with molecules too. They just bounce off each other, and that's that. But what if two people were to bump into each other, and during that collision, one person's arm got severed and reattached to the other person's face? Now that sounds really weird, but it's similar to one of the many ways that molecules can react with each other. Two molecules can join and become one. One can split apart and become two. Molecules can switch parts. All these changes are chemical reactions, and we can see them happening around us. For example, when fireworks explode, or iron rusts, or milk goes bad, or people are born, grow old, die, and then decompose. But chemical reactions don't just happen willy nilly! Everything has to be right. First, the molecules have to hit each other in the right orientation. And second, they have to hit each other hard enough, in other words, with enough energy. Now you're probably thinking that a reaction just happens in one direction and that's it. Sometimes that's true. For example, things can't unburn or unexplode. But most reactions can happen in both directions, forward and reverse. There's no reason that our face-arm guy can't bump into armless girl, reattaching that arm back to its original socket. Now let's zoom out a bit. Now let's say that you've got a thousand people on the street, and all of them start with their limbs normally attached. At the beginning, every collision is a chance for Person A to transfer an arm to Person B's face. And so at the beginning, more and more people end up with arms attached to their faces or arms missing. But as the number of people with arm-faces and missing arms grows, collisions between those people become more likely. And when they bump into each other, guess what? Normal-appendage people are reproduced. Now the number of limb transfers per second forward will start high and then fall, and the number of limb transfers per second backward will start at zero and then rise. Eventually they'll meet, they'll be the same. And when that happens, the number of people in each state stops changing, even though people are still bumping into each other and exchanging limbs. Now how many people do you think there are in each state? Half and half, right? No, well, maybe. It depends. It could be 50/50, but it could be 60/40 or 15/85, or anything. We chemists have to get our little, gloved hands dirty - ah, well, we're in a lab so not really dirty - to figure out what the actual distribution of molecules is. Even though each of limb transfers is a pretty dramatic event for the people involved, if we zoom out, we see population numbers that don't change. We call this nirvana equilibrium, and it doesn't just happen with chemical reactions. Things like gene pools and highway traffic show the same pattern. It looks pretty still from 30,000 feet, but there is lots of crazy stuff happening on the ground, you just need to zoom in to see it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is/are the requirement(s) for a collision to result in a reaction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Both proper orientation and enough energy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Only proper orientation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only enough energy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Either proper orientation or enough energy"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements is true:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All chemical reactions happen in one direction (forward)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "All chemical reactions happen in both directions (forward and reverse)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Some chemical reactions happen only in the forward direction, but most happen in both directions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Some chemical reactions happen only in the forward direction, and some happen only in the reverse direction"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "At the very beginning of a reversible reaction, what is the rate of the reverse reaction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Slower than the forward reaction, but greater than zero"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Zero"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Faster than the forward reaction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Impossible to tell"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the ratio between reactants and products after equilibrium has been established?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It’s always 1:1 (50/50)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It could be 1:1, but it could also be anything else"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It’s never 1:1"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It’s always 1:2"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How do chemists measure the rate of reactions and the position of equilibria?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By doing a bunch of experiments in the lab"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By looking closely at the molecular structures of the reactants and products"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By looking up the values in books"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By typing the reaction into a computer program"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

For example, most of the time when we talk about more\nthan one of something, we put an S on the end. One cat, two cats. But then, there's that handful of words where things work differently. Alone you have a man; if he has company, then you've got men, or probably better for him, women too. Although if there were only one of them, it would be a woman. Or if there's more than one goose, they're geese, but why not lots of mooses, meese? Or if you have two feet, then why don't you read two beek instead of books. The fact is that if you\nwere speaking English before about a thousand years ago, beek is exactly what you would have said for more than one book. If Modern English is strange, Old English needed therapy. Believe it or not, English used to be an even harder language to learn than it is today. Twenty-five hundred years ago, English and German were the same language. They drifted apart slowly, little by little becoming\nmore and more different. That meant that in early English, just like in German, inanimate objects had gender. A fork, gafol, was a woman; a spoon, laefel, was a man; and the table they were on, bord, was neither, also called neuter. Go figure! Being able to use words meant not just knowing their meaning but what gender they were, too. And while today there\nare only about a dozen plurals that don't make sense, like men and geese, in Old English, it was perfectly normal for countless plurals to be like that. You think it's odd that more\nthan one goose is geese? Well, imagine if more than one goat was a bunch of gat, or if more than one oak tree was a field of ack. To be able to talk about any of these, you just had to know the exact\nword for their plural rather than just adding\nthe handy S on the end. And it wasn't always\nan S at the end either. In merry Old English, they could add other sounds to the end. Just like more than one child is children, more than one lamb was lambru, you fried up your eggru, and people talked not about breads, but breadru. Sometimes it was like sheep is today - where, to make a plural,\nyou don't do anything. One sheep, two sheep. In Old English, one house, two house. And just like today, we have\noxen instead of oxes. Old English people had\ntoungen instead of tongues, namen instead of names, and if things stayed the way they were, today we would have eyen instead of eyes. So, why didn't things\nstay the way they were? In a word, Vikings. In the 8th century, Scandinavian marauders started taking over much of England. They didn't speak English, they spoke Norse. Plus, they were grown-ups, and grown-ups aren't as good at learning languages as children. After the age of roughly 15, it's almost impossible\nto learn a new language without an accent and without slipping up here and there as we all know from what language\nclasses are like. The Vikings were no different, so they had a way of smoothing away the harder parts of how English worked. Part of that was those crazy plurals. Imagine running up against a language with eggru and gat on the one hand, and then with other words, all you have to do is add 's' and get days and stones. Wouldn't it make things easier to just use the 's' for everything? That's how the Vikings felt too. And there were so many of them, and they married so\nmany of the English women, that pretty soon, if you\ngrew up in England, you heard streamlined English\nas much as the real kind. After a while nobody remembered\nthe real kind any more. Nobody remembered that once you said doora instead of doors and handa instead of hands. Plurals made a lot more sense now, except for a few hold-outs like children and teeth that get used so much that it was hard to break the habit. The lesson is that English makes a lot\nmore sense than you think. Thank the ancestors of people in Copenhagen and Oslo for the fact that today we don't ask\nfor a handful of pea-night instead of peanuts.

How was that? Frustrating? Slow? What were those sentences about? They're actually a simulation of the experience of dyslexia, designed to make you decode each word. Those with dyslexia experience\nthat laborious pace every time they read. When most people think of dyslexia, they think of seeing letters\nand words backwards, like seeing \"b\" as \"d\" and vice versa, or they might think people with dyslexia see \"saw\" as \"was\". The truth is people with dyslexia see things the same way as everyone else. Dyslexia is caused by a phonological\nprocessing problem, meaning people affected by it have trouble not with seeing language but with manipulating it. For example, if you heard the word cat and then someone asked\nyou, \"Remove the 'c',\" what word would you have left? At. This can be difficult\nfor those with dyslexia. Given a word in isolation, like fantastic, students with dyslexia\nneed to break the word into parts to read it: fan, tas, tic. Time spent decoding makes it hard to keep up with peers and gain sufficient comprehension. Spelling words phonetically, like s-t-i-k for stick and f-r-e-n-s for friends is also common. These difficulties are more\nwidespread and varied than commonly imagined. Dyslexia affects up to one in five people. It occurs on a continuum. One person might have mild dyslexia while the next person has\na profound case of it. Dyslexia also runs in families. It's common to see one family member who has trouble spelling while another family member has severe difficulty decoding\neven one syllable words, like catch. The continuum and distribution of dyslexia suggests a broader\nprinciple to bear in mind as we look at how the brains\nof those with dyslexia process language. Neurodiversity is the idea that because all our brains\nshow differences in structure and function, we shouldn't be so quick to label every deviation from \"the norm\" as a pathological disorder or dismiss people living\nwith these variations as \"defective.\" People with neurobiological\nvariations like dyslexia, including such creative\nand inventive individuals as Picasso, Muhammad Ali, Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, and Cher, clearly have every capacity to be brilliant and successful in life. So, here's the special way the brains of those with dyslexia work. The brain is divided into two hemispheres. The left hemisphere is generally\nin charge of language and, ultimately, reading, while the right typically\nhandles spatial activities. fMRI studies have found that the brains of those with dyslexia rely more on the right\nhemisphere and frontal lobe than the brains of those without it. This means, when they read a word, it takes a longer trip through their brain and can get delayed in the frontal lobe. Because of this neurobiological glitch, they read with more difficulty. But those with dyslexia can physically change their brain and improve their reading with an intensive,\nmulti-sensory intervention that breaks the language down and teaches the reader to decode based on syllable types\nand spelling rules. The brains of those with dyslexia begin using the left hemisphere more efficiently while reading, and their reading improves. The intervention works because it locates dyslexia appropriately as a functional variation in the brain, which, naturally, shows\nall sorts of variations from one person to another. Neurodiversity emphasizes this spectrum of brain function in all humans and suggests that to better\nunderstand the perspectives of those around us, we should try not only to see\nthe world through their eyes but understand it through their brains."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many people are affected by dyslexia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "15%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12%"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Students with dyslexia learn best with which type of teaching?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flash cards"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Memory games"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whole language"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Multisensory, explicit, systematic"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which hemisphere is responsible for language learning?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Right"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Left"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is an attribute of dyslexia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Seeing letters backwards"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Slow, laborious reading"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Seeing words backwards"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Low intelligence"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Does dyslexia run in families?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

The diameter and radius are easy, they're just straight lines you can measure with a ruler. But to get the circumference, you'd need measuring tape\nor a piece of string, unless there was a better way. Now, it's obvious that a circle's circumference\nwould get smaller or larger along with its diameter, but the relationship\ngoes further than that. In fact, the ratio between the two, the circumference divided by the diameter, will always be the same number, no matter how big\nor small the circle gets. Historians aren't sure when or how this number was first discovered, but it's been known in some form for almost 4,000 years. Estimates of it appear\nin the works of ancient Greek, Babylonian, Chinese, and Indian mathematicians. And it's even believed to have been used in building the Egyptian pyramids. Mathematicians estimated it by inscribing polygons in circles. And by the year 1400, it had been calculated to as far\nas ten decimal places. So, when did they finally\nfigure out the exact value instead of just estimating? Actually, never! You see, the ratio of a circle's circumference\nto its diameter is what's known as an irrational number, one that can never be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers. You can come close, but no matter how precise the fraction is, it will always be just a tiny bit off. So, to write it out in its decimal form, you'd have an on-going series of digits starting with 3.14159 and continuing forever! That's why, instead of trying to write out an infinite number of digits every time, we just refer to it using\nthe Greek letter pi. Nowadays, we test the speed of computers by having them calculate pi, and quantum computers have been able to calculate it\nup to two quadrillion digits. People even compete to see how many digits they can memorize and have set records for remembering over 67,000 of them. But for most scientific uses, you only need the first forty or so. And what are these scientific uses? Well, just about any calculations\ninvolving circles, from the volume of a can of soda to the orbits of satellites. And it's not just circles, either. Because it's also useful\nin studying curves, pi helps us understand periodic\nor oscillating systems like clocks, electromagnetic waves, and even music. In statistics, pi is used in the equation to calculate the area\nunder a normal distribution curve, which comes in handy\nfor figuring out distributions of standardized test scores, financial models, or margins of error in scientific results. As if that weren't enough, pi is used in particle\nphysics experiments, such as those using\nthe Large Hadron Collider, not only due to its round shape, but more subtly, because of the orbits\nin which tiny particles move. Scientists have even used pi to prove the illusive notion that light functions as both a particle and an electromagnetic wave, and, perhaps most impressively, to calculate the density\nof our entire universe, which, by the way, still has infinitely less stuff in it than the total number of digits in pi."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which parts of a circle are easy to measure and why?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Circumference and volume; they are standard for all circles"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Heightand width; they are flat surfaces"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Diameter and radius; they are straight lines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hypotenuse and angle; they are always double the radius and diameter, respectively"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "It has been known for 4,000 years that what ratio is always the same?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Circumference divided by diameter"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Diameter divided by the radius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Radius divided by the circumference"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Circumference divided by the square of the hypotenuse"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is known as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A square of the hypotenuse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An irrational number"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An inconstant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A phenomenon of mathematical impossibility"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In ________, pi is used to calculate the area under a ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "robotics; volumetric pressure unit"}, {"label": "B", "text": "home economics; typical Bakelite pan cover"}, {"label": "C", "text": "economics; standardized displacement bubble"}, {"label": "D", "text": "statistics; normal distribution curve"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Perhaps most impressively, pi has been used to ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Estimate the amount of hair that has ever grown on the entire human species"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Determine how many beach balls will fit inside the sun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Calculate the density of our entire universe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Project the population of the earth through the year 3450"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 100, "lesson": 19, "title": "Comma story - Terisa Folaron", "category": "Writing/Composition", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/comma-story-terisa-folaron", "transcript": {"en": "Commas are tricky things, especially when subordinates and conjunctions are involved. If you can remember a few basic rules, a simple law of physics, and some common scenarios, you will be able to use commas correctly. I like to think of the different parts of our sentence as characters. Let's meet a few of them: the tiny conjunctions, the mighty subordinates, and the clever comma. Conjunctions are small and nimble. They are words that connect clauses, words, and phrases. You can easily remember the conjunctions by remembering the acronym FANBOYS. The conjunctions are for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. Because they're so small, more often than not, they require the help of a comma but not always. Subordinates, on the other hand, are the WWE heavyweight\nchampions of sentences. They are words that connect\ntwo unequal things, dependent and independent clauses. Subordinates make it very clear what is being prioritized in a sentence. Commonly used subordinates are although, because, before, however, unless, and even though. Because subordinates are all about power, they can do a lot of heavy\nlifting by themselves. But, of course, sometimes\neven the strongest among us needs some help from our clever friends. Because our clever comma is so nice, she often roams her neighborhood looking for some community service to do. Today, as soon as she leaves her house, she sees a subordinate lifting the weight of two complete sentences, one on each arm. Bartheleme loves engaging\nin political debate even though he usually loses. The comma asks the subordinate\nif he needs help. Well, we know that subordinates are the WWE heavyweight\nchampions of sentences. They can easily hold the weight of these two complete sentences because they are distributed\nevenly on both arms. So, when the comma asks if it can help, the subordinate is appalled at the idea of needing assistance. No thanks, maybe next time! So, the comma continues on. Soon, she seems a couple of subordinates attempting to lift the weight of sentences directly\nin front of themselves. Even though Bartheleme loves to sing, he never sings in front of others. The comma asks the subordinates\nif they need help. They might not want to admit it, but this time the subordinates\ndo need help. Complete sentences weigh quite a bit. Simple physics tells us that it's easier to balance heavy objects if the weight is evenly distributed. So, while the subordinates\nare quite capable of balancing two complete sentences when carrying the weight on both sides, they're having trouble\npicking just one up. The comma rushes over to help the struggling subordinates, but how will she help? When subordinates begin sentences, the comma will place herself directly after the first\nthought or complete sentence. After helping the subordinates, our comma heroine continues on and spots a conjunction holding the weight\nof two complete sentences. Bartheleme was accepted\ninto the University of Chicago, and he is on the waitlist\nfor Stanford University. The comma asks the conjunction\nif he needs help. Of course he does! Hurry! The comma rushes and places\nitself before the conjunction. Fanboys aren't as militant\nas subordinates. For this reason, the commas don't have to fall\nin line behind the fanboys. Fanboys are courteous creatures. They allow the comma to go ahead of them. Helping others is hard work! On her way home, our comma sees a conjunction\nholding up the weight of a complete sentence and a fragment sentence. Bartheleme is going to major\nin molecular biology or interpretive dance. The now-exhausted comma\nasks the conjunction if he needs help lifting the items. This is one of the rare occassions where a conjunction doesn't\nneed the help of a comma. The conjunction assures the comma that help isn't needed, which is good for the comma because by now, all it wants to do is go home and rest up for another day of vigilant\nsentence constructing."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Harold is an excellent singer and he can dance all of the latest dance moves.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Insert comma before the conjunction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Insert comma after the conjunction"}, {"label": "C", "text": "No comma needed"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Nobody knows Harold can dance because he refuses to dance in public.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Insert comma before the subordinator"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Insert comma after the subordinator"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Insert comma after the word refuses"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No comma needed"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "I want Harold to show me how to dance but I’m afraid to ask him.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Insert comma before the conjunction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Insert comma after the conjunction"}, {"label": "C", "text": "No comma needed"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Even though people don’t think I am shy I am.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Insert comma before the subordinate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Insert comma directly after the subordinate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Insert comma after the word shy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No comma needed"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Harold is going to the prom with Kendra or Olivia.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Insert comma after the word prom"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Insert comma before the conjunction"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Insert comma after the conjunction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No comma needed"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

But don't worry, this isn't the opening\nof a new Michael Bay movie. This is The Journey of the Polar Lights. The northern and southern lights,\nalso known as the aurora Borealis and aurora Australis, respectively, occur when high energy\nparticles from the Sun collide with neutral atoms\nin our atmosphere. The energy emitted from this crash\nproduces a spectacle of light that mankind has marveled at\nfor centuries. But the particles' journey\nisn't just as simple as leaving the Sun and arriving at Earth. Like any cross-country road trip,\nthere's a big detour and nobody asks for directions. Let's track this intergalactic voyage by focusing on three\nmain points of their journey: leaving the Sun, making a pit stop\nin the Earth's magnetic fields, and arriving at the atmosphere\nabove our heads. The protons and electrons\ncreating the northern lights depart from the Sun's corona. The corona is the outermost layer\nof the Sun's atmosphere and is one of the hottest regions. Its intense heat causes the Sun's hydrogen\nand helium atoms to vibrate and shake off protons and electrons as if they were stripping off\nlayers on a hot, sunny day. Impatient and finally behind the wheel, these free protons\nand electrons move too fast to be contained by the Sun's gravity and group together as plasma,\nan electrically charged gas. They travel away from the Sun\nas a constant gale of plasma, known as the solar wind. However, the Earth prevents the solar wind\nfrom traveling straight into the planet by setting up a detour, the magnetosphere. The magnetosphere is formed\nby the Earth's magnetic currents and shields our planet\nfrom the solar winds by sending out the particles\naround the Earth. Their opportunity to continue the journey\ndown to the atmosphere comes when the magnetosphere is\noverwhelmed by a new wave of travelers. This event is coronal mass ejection, and it occurs when the Sun shoots out a massive ball of plasma\ninto the solar wind. When one of these coronal mass ejections\ncollides with Earth, it overpowers the magnetosphere\nand creates a magnetic storm. The heavy storm stresses the magnetosphere\nuntil it suddenly snaps back, like and overstretched elastic band, flinging some of the detoured\nparticles towards Earth. The retracting band of the magnetic field\ndrags them down to the aurora ovals, which are the locations\nof the northern and southern lights. After traveling 93 million miles\nacross the galaxy, the Sun's particles finally produce\ntheir dazzling light show with the help of some friends. 20 to 200 miles above the surface, the electrons and protons meet up\nwith oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and they sure are happy to see each other. The Sun's particles high five the atoms,\ngiving their energy to the Earth's neutral\noxygen and nitrogen atoms. When the atoms in the atmosphere\nare contacted by the particles, they get excited and emit photons. Photons are small bursts of energy\nin the form of light. The colors that appear in the sky depend on the wavelength\nof the atom's photon. Excited oxygen atoms are responsible\nfor the green and red colors, whereas excited nitrogen atoms\nproduce blue and deep red hues. The collection of these interactions is what creates the northern\nand southern lights. The polar lights\nare best seen on clear nights in regions close to magnetic\nnorth and south poles. Nighttime is ideal because the Aurora\nis much dimmer than sunlight and cannot be seen in daytime. Remember to look up at the sky\nand read up on the Sun's energy patterns, specifically sunspots and solar flares, as these will be good guides\nfor predicting the auroras."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the region of Earth in which the polar lights occur?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Auroral oval"}, {"label": "B", "text": "North Pole"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hemisphere"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Magnetic zone"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is a constant gale of plasma from the sun called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sun flare"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Solar wind"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Coronal mass ejection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sun current"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the shield around the Earth that captures charged particles?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Plasmasphere"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Magnetosheath"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Trapping region"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Magnetosphere"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are small bursts of energy in the form of light?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Neutrons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Photons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Atoms"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the area of the sun that shoots out particles that head towards Earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Core"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Corona"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Photosphere"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Convective Zone"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

That between the mouse click\nand the video playing, there was something\nthat captured your intention, understood it, and made it real? What is that something? Is it gremlins? Let's imagine that we can shrink down to the size of an electron and inject ourselves\ninto a click of a mouse. If you took your mouse apart, you'd see that it's really\na very simple machine. It has a couple buttons and a system for detecting\nmotion and distance. You might have an optical mouse that makes these measurements\nwith lights and sensors, but older ones did this\nwith a hard rubber ball and some plastic wheels. Same concept. When you click the button on your mouse, it sends a message to the computer with information about its position. When your mouse click is received, it's handled by the basic\ninput/output subsystem. This subsystem acts like the eyes and ears and mouth and hands of the computer. Basically, it provides\na way for the computer to interact with its environment. But it also acts like a buffer to keep the CPU from being\noverwhelmed by distractions. In this case, the I/O subsystem decides that your mouse click is pretty important so it generates an interrupt to the CPU. \"Hey, CPU! Got a click here.\" The CPU, or central processing unit, is the brains of the whole computer. Just like your brain doesn't\ntake up your whole body, the CPU doesn't take\nup the whole computer, but it runs the show all the same. And the CPU's job, its whole job, is fetching instructions from memory and executing them. So, while you're typing, typing, typing, maybe really fast, like 60 words a minute, the CPU is fetching and executing billions of instructions a second. Yes, billions every second: instructions to move your mouse\naround on the screen, to run that clock widget on your desktop, play your internet radio, manage the files you're\nediting on the hard drive, and much, much more. Your computer's CPU\nis one heck of a multitasker! \"But oh my gosh there's a very important mouse click coming through now! Let's drop everything now\nand deal with that!\" There are programs for everything that the CPU does. A special program for the mouse, for the clock widget, for the internet radio, and for dealing with letters\nsent by the keyboard. Each program was initially\nwritten by a human in a human-readable programming language, like Java, C++, or Python. But human programs take up a lot of space and contain a lot of unnecessary\ninformation to a computer, so they are compiled and made smaller and stored in bits of ones\nand zeros in memory. The CPU realizes that it\nneeds instructions for how to deal with this mouse click, so it looks up the address\nfor the mouse program and sends a request\nto the memory subsystem for instructions stored there. Each instruction\nin the mouse device driver is duly fetched and executed. And that's not nearly\nthe end of the story! Because the CPU learns\nthat the mouse was clicked when the cursor was over a picture of a button on the monitor screen, and so, the CPU asks memory\nfor the monitor program to find out what that button is. And then the CPU has to ask memory for the program for the button, which means that the CPU needs the monitor program again to show the video\nassociated with the button, and so it goes. And let's just say there\nare a lot of programs involved before you even see\nthe button on the screen light up when you clicked it. So, just the simple task\nof clicking your mouse means visiting\nall of the critical components of your computer's architecture: peripherals, the basic input-output system, the CPU, programs, and memory, and not one gremlin."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The BIOS is most like the computer’s", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eyes and hands"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stomach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lungs"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The CPU can handle ________ of instructions a second", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thousands"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Millions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Billions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gazillions"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Programs are encoded and stored in memory as", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1's and 0's"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Raw text"}, {"label": "C", "text": "HTML"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Electrons"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The CPU’s job is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To store information"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To deal with input and output from peripherals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To edit files in memory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To fetch and execute instructions"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The critical components of your computer’s architecture are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wires, Plastic, Silicon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Programs, Bits, Bytes, HTML"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Peripherals, BIOS, CPU, Programs, Memory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mouse, Motherboard, Integrated Circuits, Wires"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "BIOS stands for", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Biological Input Operating System"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Basic Input Output System"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Basic Integer Operating System"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Basic Input Output Software"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Ha, right? I mean, we could spy on people\nwithout being noticed and do whatever we want without being held responsible. Now, magicians have figured out how to utilize full-sized\nmirrors to bend light in order to create disappearing illusions. Scientists have created metamaterials to guide rays of light around tiny, two-dimensional objects. Cameras can also film what is behind you and project the image so you appear invisible from the front. However, none of these options can make an object as large as a person appear invisible\nfor all angles and distances while its moving. But if you are truly invisible, as in from within, here are a few problems you may not have thought about before. To move around undetected by other people, you would have to be totally naked. Even if it's freezing outside! You can't carry anything, including your wallet and keys, otherwise people would just see your wallet and keys floating around. Drivers and people on the street\ncan't see you either, therefore they can and will run\ninto you at some point. Oh, and you better not wear any perfume or make any noise breathing, otherwise they'll know you're there. And, just because you start off invisible, doesn't mean you'll stay that way. What if someone accidentally spills scolding hot coffee on you? And what if it rains? But if you think only liquid\ncan make you visible, you're wrong. Dust consists of dead\nskin cells from humans, soil particles, and fibers from clothes made from cotton and other materials. Dust sticks to the moisture\non our skin when we sweat and the tiny hairs\non our skin when we are dry. So, even if you are invisible, dust would still land\non every part of you. We usually don't notice\nthe dust on our skin because we can't see a thin layer of dust on top of our skin color. But, if you're invisible, people would see\na human-shaped blob of dust walking around with extremely dirty soles. Gross! What do you think the world looks like if you are invisible? Well, the answer is nothing. The reason you can't see in the dark is because there is no light. To see an apple, light has to hit the apple and return it to your eyes. Then, the retinas in your eyes catch the light reflection for your brain to interpret into the image of an apple. If you're invisible, then, by definition, light would travel through you or around you instead of bouncing off you\nfor people to see. But that means that retinas in your eyes are not catching the light, either. Therefore, your brain has nothing to interpret into an image. Can you see your reflection without a mirror to stop the light? No. So, when you can't be seen by others, you also cannot see. Ouch! Now, have you given any thought as of whether the invisibility\nis permanent? If it is, how can you\nreceive medical treatment from a doctor if you're injured? The doctor wouldn't know where to apply ointments or bandages because they cannot access your injury. For that matter, you can't see it either. I mean, what if you have\nan illness or an infection? How can the doctor diagnose you without being able to see\nthe color change or inflammation? And what if everyone\nis permanently invisible? Well, think about how boring\nthe world would be without seeing people on the streets, on TV, or at home on your computer like right now. It's lonely being invisible.

As of 2012, the world record for fastest short-distance sprint speed is roughly 27 miles per hour. Running speed depends on how much force is exerted by the runner's legs, and according to Newton's Second\nLaw of Motion, force is the product of mass\ntimes acceleration. And Newton's Third Law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, that means running requires having a ground to push off from, and the ground pushes back\nagainst the runner's foot. So, flying would actually be more similar to swimming. Michael Phelps is currently\nthe fastest human in water and the most decorated\nOlympian of all time. Guess how fast he swims? The answer may surprise you. His fastest recorded speed is less than 5 miles per hour. A child on the ground can easily outrun Michael Phelps in water, but why is that? Well, let's go back\nto Newton's Third Law of Motion. When we run, we move forward by pushing against the ground\nwith our feet and the ground pushes back, propelling us forward. The ground is solid. By definition, it means the particles are essentially locked into place and must push back instead\nof getting out of the way, but water is liquid and flows easily. When we move our limbs to push back against the water, a part of the water molecules can just slide past one another instead of pushing back. Now, let's think about flying. Air has a lot more free space for particles to move past one another, so even more of our energy\nwould be wasted. We would need to push\na lot of air backwards in order to move forward. Astronauts move around in shuttles in zero gravity when\nthey're in outer space by pulling on handles installed\non the ceiling walls and floors of the shuttle. Now, imagine you were\ngiven the ability to float. How would you move\naround in the middle of the street? Well, you wouldn't get very far by swimming in air, would you? Nah, I don't think so! Now, assuming you were\ngranted the ability to float and the speed to move around efficiently, let's discuss the height of your flight. According to the Ideal Gas Law, P-V N-R-T, pressure and temperature has\na positive correlation, meaning they increase\nand decrease together. This is because the air expands in volume with less pressure, so the molecules have more\nroom to wander around without colliding into each other\nand creating heat. Since the atmospheric\npressure is a lot lower in high altitudes, it would be freezing cold if you were flying above the clouds. You'd need to wrap yourself up to keep your core body temperature above 95 degrees Fahrenheit, otherwise you'd start shivering violently, gradually becoming mentally confused and eventually drop out of the sky due to loss of muscle control from hypothermia! Now, the Ideal Gas Law implies that as the pressure decreases, gas volume increases. So, if you were to fly\nstraight up too quickly, the inert gas in your body\nwould rapidly expand the way soda fizzes up when shaken. The phenomenon is called \"the bends,\" decompression sickness, or \"divers disease\" since deep sea scuba\ndivers experience this when they come up too quickly. This results in pain, paralysis, or death, depending on how foamy your blood becomes. Okay, well, let's say you want to fly just a few meters above the ground where you can still see the road signs and breath oxygen with ease. You'll still need goggles and a helmet to protect you from birds, insects, street signs, electrical wires, and other flying humans, including flying cops ready to hand you a ticket if you don't follow\nthe flying rules, buddy. Now remember, if you\nhave a collision mid-air that knocks you unconscious, you would experience free fall until you hit the ground. Without society or the laws of physics, flying would be a totally\nawesome ability to have. But, even if we could\nall just float around a few feet above the ground and only moving at a snail's pace, I'm telling you, it's still\na cool ability that I'd want, wouldn't you? Yeah, I thought so. Now, which superpower physics lesson will you explore next?

In movies, kings are always searching\nfor the secret to immortality. But is immortality really a good thing? To a ten-year-old boy,\none year is the same as 10% of his life. To his forty-year-old mother,\none year is merely 2.5% of her life. The same year, 365 days, can feel differently to different people. If we live until we're 82, that's about 30,000 days. If this boy lives for 30,000 years,\na year to him could feel like a day. And if this boy's emotions sustain through the potential boredom\nof living for millions of years, he might become extremely lonely and sad, knowing he has and always will\noutlive everyone he has ever loved. But what if everyone were immortal? Well, first off, Earth is only so big. So, where would we all live? (Grunts) \"Excuse me!\"\n\"That's my face!\" \"Stop it!\"\n\"Pardon me.\" \"Tight in here!\" Do you remember what you did last year\nor when you were five? How much of your past have you forgotten? If you have trouble remembering\nwhat you did when you were five, how will you remember what happened\nif you were alive a thousand years ago? A million years ago? We don't remember every single\ndetail of our past because our brains have a limited capacity and we replace useless memories, like middle school locker combinations, with relevant information. If this immortal boy finds a companion to fall in love with\nonce every hundred years, he would have ten thousand girlfriends\nin a million years. And how many of those\nten thousand girls' names will he be able to remember? This changes what a meaningful\nrelationship means, doesn't it? Another tricky thing about immortality: Human beings have not\nalways looked the same. This can be explained\nby Darwin's theory of evolution. For instance, if women find\ntaller men more attractive, then more tall men would mate\nand have children, putting more tall genes in the gene pool. That means, in the next generation, more children will have\nthe genes to be taller. Repeat that process for a million years and the average height\nwill be a lot taller than the average height today, assuming there's no natural disaster\nthat wipes out all the tall people. Our ancestors were short, hairy apes. We still have body hair,\nbut we don't look like apes any more. If you're the only person who is immortal, while everyone else keeps evolving, generation after generation, you will eventually look quite different\nthan the people who surround you. \"Hi, how you doing?\" If one of our ancestors, apes,\nis still alive today, how many people will make friends with it instead of calling\nthe Museum of Natural History? And one more physical consideration\nfor immortality: Scars. After all, immortality doesn't\nautomatically translate to invincibility, it just means you cannot die. But it doesn't guarantee\nwhat condition you'll be alive in. Look at your body\nand count how many scars you have. If you have made this many permanent scars within your life, imagine how much damage you would have\nif you were one thousand years old! Now, there are approximately 185,000 amputation-related\nhospital discharges every year in the U.S. These injuries are due\nto accidents or illnesses. Certainly the percentage is low\ncomparing to the total population if you only live for a hundred years. However, if you've been alive\nfor over one million years, the odds of still having\nall your limbs are pretty slim. What about little accessories, like your eyes, your nose, your ears, fingers or toes? What about your teeth? What are the odds of you\nkeeping your dental health for a hundred years? A thousand years? One million years? You might end up looking like\na horribly scuffed-up Mr. Potato Head with missing pieces and dentures. So, are you sure you want to live forever?
