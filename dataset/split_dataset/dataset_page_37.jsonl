This week we've got a question from Lulu Miller, \nthe host of NPR's Invisibilia podcast: How old are our bodies actually? Because if you think about how\nwe're constantly being regenerated our physical matter is being shed and replenished ... what actually remains? Good question, Lulu! Well, your hair obviously doesn't remain\nthe same and I'm not just talking about the style each hair on your head is replaced every\n2 to 7 years A hundred hairs fall out every day\nand new ones grow back in their place And look at your fingernails - \nthey're completely new every six months or so it turns out it's just a matter of time\nbefore almost every part of your body refreshes itself in a similar way The lining of your stomach and intestines gets pretty beat up -- it's constantly\nexposed to acid and bile and so those cells get replaced every few days Every few weeks, your outer layer of \nskin is completely renewed Every four months you have\na fresh army of red blood cells A hundred million new cells are born every minute and a hundred million old cells are destroyed It's actually the breakdown products of these red blood cells that turn your bruises and urine yellow Every 10 years, you've got a new skeleton a special team of cells breaks down old bone and another builds new bone Every 15 years your muscles are refreshed You might think you gain and lose fat cells\nwhen you gain and lose weight but the actually just get bigger and smaller Over the course of 25 years though,\nmost of them turn over But there are a few things that\nstick around for your entire life About half of your heart stays with you\nfrom birth to death because those cells are replaced very slowly Certain parts of your brain add a few new\nneurons over the course of your life but the vast majority of your neurons\ndeveloped before you were born It's the connections between those neurons\n-- the circuits that store memories -- that are constantly changing And there's one more\npart of you that lasts your whole life Months before you were born, a little cluster of cells stretched and\nfilled themselves with transparent protein As you grew, even after birth, more and more fibers were added, but that center endured This is your lens the window through\nwhich you are watching this video right now and its core has remained the same\nsince the moment you first opened your eyes So how old is your body really? Some of it is brand-new and some of it\nis as old as you are To learn how scientists figured all this out,\ncheck out our post at skunkbear.tumblr.com And listen to Invisibilia -- the latest episode is about whether or not personality persists throughout your entire life If you have science questions send them our way and please subscribe to our channel!"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how many of your hairs fall out each day?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "500"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1,000"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why do the cells lining your digestive system get replaced so frequently?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "because of frequent contact with acid and bile"}, {"label": "B", "text": "because abrasive mass moves through them regularly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "because you gain and lose weight frequently"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 37, "lesson": 2, "title": "What you don't know about who you will become", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/cVhQJDNq", "transcript": {"en": "At every stage of our lives we make decisions that will profoundly influence the lives of the people we're going to become, and then when we become those people, we're not always thrilled with the decisions we made. So young people pay good money to get tattoos removed that teenagers paid good money to get. Middle-aged people rushed to divorce people who young adults rushed to marry. Older adults work hard to lose what middle-aged adults worked hard to gain. On and on and on. The question is, as a psychologist,\nthat fascinates me is, why do we make decisions that our future selves so often regret? Now, I think one of the reasons -- I'll try to convince you today — is that we have a fundamental misconception about the power of time. Every one of you knows that the rate of change slows over the human lifespan, that your children seem to change by the minute but your parents seem to change by the year. But what is the name of this magical point in life where change suddenly goes from a gallop to a crawl? Is it teenage years? Is it middle age? Is it old age? The answer, it turns out, for most people, is now, wherever now happens to be. What I want to convince you today is that all of us are walking around with an illusion, an illusion that history, our personal history, has just come to an end, that we have just recently become the people that we were always meant to be and will be for the rest of our lives. Let me give you some data to back up that claim. So here's a study of change in people's personal values over time. Here's three values. Everybody here holds all of them, but you probably know that as you grow, as you age, the balance of these values shifts. So how does it do so? Well, we asked thousands of people. We asked half of them to predict for us how much their values would\nchange in the next 10 years, and the others to tell us how much their values had\nchanged in the last 10 years. And this enabled us to do a really\ninteresting kind of analysis, because it allowed us to compare the predictions of people, say, 18 years old, to the reports of people who were 28, and to do that kind of analysis\nthroughout the lifespan. Here's what we found. First of all, you are right, change does slow down as we age, but second, you're wrong, because it doesn't slow nearly as much as we think. At every age, from 18 to 68 in our data set, people vastly underestimated how much change they would experience over the next 10 years. We call this the \"end of history\" illusion. To give you an idea of the magnitude of this effect, you can connect these two lines, and what you see here is that 18-year-olds anticipate changing only as much as 50-year-olds actually do. Now it's not just values. It's all sorts of other things. For example, personality. Many of you know that psychologists now claim that there are five fundamental\ndimensions of personality: neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness. Again, we asked people how much they expected to change over the next 10 years, and also how much they had\nchanged over the last 10 years, and what we found, well, you're going to get used to\nseeing this diagram over and over, because once again the rate of change does slow as we age, but at every age, people underestimate how much their personalities will change in the next decade. And it isn't just ephemeral things like values and personality. You can ask people about their likes and dislikes, their basic preferences. For example, name your best friend, your favorite kind of vacation, what's your favorite hobby, what's your favorite kind of music. People can name these things. We ask half of them to tell us, \"Do you think that that will\nchange over the next 10 years?\" and half of them to tell us, \"Did that change over the last 10 years?\" And what we find, well, you've seen it twice now, and here it is again: people predict that the friend they have now is the friend they'll have in 10 years, the vacation they most enjoy now is the one they'll enjoy in 10 years, and yet, people who are 10 years older all say, \"Eh, you know, that's really changed.\" Does any of this matter? Is this just a form of mis-prediction\nthat doesn't have consequences? No, it matters quite a bit, and\nI'll give you an example of why. It bedevils our decision-making in important ways. Bring to mind right now for yourself your favorite musician today and your favorite musician 10 years ago. I put mine up on the screen to help you along. Now we asked people to predict for us, to tell us how much money they would pay right now to see their current favorite musician perform in concert 10 years from now, and on average, people said they would pay 129 dollars for that ticket. And yet, when we asked them\nhow much they would pay to see the person who was their favorite 10 years ago perform today, they say only 80 dollars. Now, in a perfectly rational world, these should be the same number, but we overpay for the opportunity to indulge our current preferences because we overestimate their stability. Why does this happen? We're not entirely sure, but it probably has to do with the ease of remembering versus the difficulty of imagining. Most of us can remember\nwho we were 10 years ago, but we find it hard to imagine who we're going to be, and then we mistakenly think\nthat because it's hard to imagine, it's not likely to happen. Sorry, when people say \"I can't imagine that,\" they're usually talking about\ntheir own lack of imagination, and not about the unlikelihood of the event that they're describing. The bottom line is, time is a powerful force. It transforms our preferences. It reshapes our values. It alters our personalities. We seem to appreciate this fact, but only in retrospect. Only when we look backwards do we realize how much change happens in a decade. It's as if, for most of us, the present is a magic time. It's a watershed on the timeline. It's the moment at which we finally become ourselves. Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they're finished. The person you are right now is as transient, as fleeting and as temporary as all the people you've ever been. The one constant in our life is change. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But he wasn't a performer, he was an orangutan. The keepers who locked \nhis enclosure every night were baffled to find him outside\nthe next day hanging out with friends in a tree, or sunning on the roof. Only after installing cameras \ndid they realize Fu Manchu had been picking the lock with a metal wire that he kept hidden\nunder his cheek pouch. The keepers shouldn't have been\nsurprised at Fu Manchu's cunningness. Along with our other great ape cousins, the gorillas, chimps, and bonobos, they belong to our Hominidae\nfamily tree, which stretches back 14 million years. But it's not just their striking red hair that makes orangutans unique \namong our cousins. As the only great apes from Asia, orangutans have adapted to a life\nhigh in the rain forest canopies. Many of the skills they learn\nare transmitted through the special bond they have with their mothers, the most extended in the animal kingdom\nnext to humans. Orangutan mothers usually give birth\nto one baby at a time, waiting up to eight years before\nhaving another. This gives the young, who begin as fully dependent infants, plenty of time to learn how to climb and distinguish the hundreds of plants\nand fruits that make up their diet. Female orangutans even stay with\ntheir mothers into their teen years to learn child-rearing. As they grow up, orangutans also develop\na complex set of cooperative social skills by interacting with their peers\nand siblings. Much like ourselves, young orangutans involuntarily mimic\nthe facial expressions and emotions of their playmates, with behaviors that closely parallel\nhuman smiling and laughter. Once they finally venture out \non their own, orangutans continue to develop\ntheir resourcefulness, putting the skills they've learned \ninto practice. Adults build a new nest each night\nby carefully weaving twigs together, topping them with soft leaves,\npillows, and blankets. This process requires dexterity,\ncoordination, and an eye for design. Orangutans also use a variety of tools\nto make their lives in the jungle easier. They turn branches into fly swatters\nand back scratchers, construct umbrellas when it rains, make gloves from leafy pads, and even use leaves as bandages\nto dress their wounds. But orangutan intelligence goes far\nbeyond jungle survival. Research in controlled environments\nhas shown that orangutans are self-aware, being one of the few species to recognize\ntheir own reflections. They also display remarkable foresight,\nplanning, and cognition. In one experiment, researchers taught\nan orangutan to use a straw to extract his favorite fruit soup\nfrom a box. That orangutan was later given the choice\nbetween the straw or a grape that could be \neaten right away, and he chose the straw just in case\nhe was given another box of soup. In another experiment, orangutans figured\nout how to reach peanuts at the bottom of long tubes\nby spitting water into them. While orangutans are able to pass\ncognitive tests with flying colors, there are certain problems that they\nneed our help to solve. Indonesia has the world's highest rate\nof deforestation, and millions of acres of rain forest \nare burned annually to support the logging \nand palm oil industries. Deforestation exposes the 30,000\norangutans remaining in the wild to poachers. They kill mothers so that baby orangutans\ncan be sold as exotic pets. But fortunately, the story often\ndoesn't end here. Orphans can be confiscated\nand given a second chance. At special forest schools, they recover\nfrom emotional trauma and continue to develop \nessential life skills. Against all odds, these orphans \ndemonstrate incredible resilience and readiness to learn. In Malay, the word orangutan translates\nliterally to \"the person of the forest,\" a reminder of our common lineage. And despite orangutans being some\nof the smartest animals on Earth, outsmarting their extinction requires\nthe creativity, empathy, and foresight that our species share."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When contrasted with our other ape cousins, what is a unique feature of orangutans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their red hair"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Their ability to build nests"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Their ability to climb trees"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their long arms"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why does a baby orangutan stay with its mother for so long?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because baby orangutans grow very slowly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "So that baby orangutans can learn to climb, socialize, and to distinguish foods"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because mother orangutans nurse their babies for 8 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "So that baby orangutans are safe from poachers"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these is NOT an example of orangutan tool use?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Making nests to sleep in"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Using leaves to dress wounds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Constructing umbrellas to protect against rain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Starting fires to keep warm"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why does Indonesia have the highest rate of deforestation in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To support oil and gas industries"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To clear more land for human settlement"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To support the palm oil and logging industries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To clear more land for state parks"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In Malay, what does the word orangutan translate literally to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Orange human"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Person of the forest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Red ape"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Primates of the jungle"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 37, "lesson": 4, "title": "Why can't we just print money to pay off debt?", "category": "Global Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/8GnNolun", "transcript": {"en": "have you ever wondered why countries can't just print more money to pay off their debts or to feed the homeless or to fix unemployment or any other issue for that matter now this may seem like a rather silly question but I think it's one of those questions that people may be too embarrassed to ask but there's no shortage of people wondering the short answer can be summed up in one word inflation inflation is defamed as a persistent substantial rise in the general level of prices related to an increase in the volume of money resulting in a loss of value of currency but I'll get to that first though we need to establish exactly what money is now this may seem obvious but something that you need to understand is that money has absolutely no intrinsic value what that means that money in itself has no actual value is only considered valuable because it can buy things but if you were stranded on a desert island money would be totally useless money only has value because we believe it has value this is called the Tinkerbell effect something I learned about from Vsauce the Tinkerbell effect is used to describe something that only exists because we believe it exists and this is the case with money hypothetically speaking if he were suddenly started to believe that money had no value it wouldn't have value of course it wasn't always this way money has been around for millennia and when it was first used it was in the form of commodity money things were treated that had actual value and uses like salt spaces horses and weapons as well as precious metals such as gold and silver which technically don't have any intrinsic value either but due to the rarity they're almost universally accepted as currency then we have representative money since carrying around everything you own can be difficult representative money makes more sense basically you get your goal to a bank and they keep it safe for you and then return they give you a piece of paper acknowledging that you own that gold these pieces of paper can therefore be used as money as anyone can go and redeem the gold at any time but today almost every country in the world uses fiat money fiat money requires faith and Trust and the government that their money will have value if we use a relatively young country as an example the United States has gone through all three monetary systems within 200 years in 1790 when the United States stopped using European money a Claims Act of 1972 brought the inception of the US dollar the US dollar was originally informed commodity money in the form of gold silver and copper coins the coins were actually made from real gold silver and copper and the value of the metal that made the coins were exactly equal to their faith value the country then moved on to a mixture of commodity and representative money with the 1900 gold standard act the government issued dollar bells which could be exchanged for gold ane tame gold standard is a type of representative money that many countries used at the time this was an effective way to accurately calculate the exchange rate between countries for example if one gram of gold costs one pound in Britain and one dollar 50 in America that you can easily deduce that one pen must equal one dollar 50 gold coins were discontinued and the silver was removed from other coins effectively aimed at commodity money in the United States in 1971 Richard Nixon officially abandoned the gold standard on the US moved on to fiat money so today money isn't backed by gold or anything else of value for that matter survived to the question at hand basic economics tells us that an increase in supply it results in foreign demand and therefore foreign praise so the more money and the economy the lower the value of each dollar meaning other countries can purchase more dollars and Asians for their currency the second supply and demand graph shows why life leads to a rise in prices more money and the economy causes a shift in and demand curve for goods and services but since this isn't matched by an increase in economic output prices much rise look at it this way if the government printed a million dollars and posted it to everyone in the country causing everyone to go out and buy a sports car but there's only a finite number of sports cars in the country so the logical thing to do is to increase the price of a sports car if we use an analogies to demonstrate this imagine there's four people on a desert island they each have ten pieces of fruit all fruits are considered equal and value now imagine they discover a whole forest of apple trees the nominal value of apples has increased because there's more of them but the actual value of an apple has gone down due to an increase in supply therefore in their costs ten apples for one banana since demand for apples is low but high for bananas just a clarify in this analogy the people represent different country's the fruit their respective currency and the apple trees the printed money but it's not just because of economic theory that we know printing too much money is a bad idea there's several examples throughout recent history the most recent example is Zimbabwe who in 2008 suffered extremely high inflation due to printing money this was the result of some awful decisions by president with Gabi when the economy took a turn for the worst when Gabi printed more money to pay government expenditure this caused inflation to skyrocket and in mid November 2008 the Babli's inflation peaked at actually wait hold on things first I need to provide some context inflation eliminated states is around 2% economists generally agree that inflation levels of 1 to 3% are optimum first world countries inflation rates today it range from 0 to 5 percent a country is said to enter hyperinflation when their inflation levels exceed 50 percent so with that in mind Zimbabwe's inflation at its peak reached 6 point 5 secs tell Ian percent or to put it another way that number has 22 digits it got so bad that prices doubled every 24 hours the government tried to solve the problem by printing more and more money with higher and higher denominations they also kept knocking zeros off the end by revaluing the Zimbabwean dollar three times going through four different currencies with four different ISO codes for the final redenomination they were printing 100 trillion dollar bills people were literally using wheelbarrows full of cash to buy a loaf of bread the government even made inflation illegal at one point and people were actually arrested for raising prices in 2009 ISM Bob Wian dollar was abandoned and to this day they still have no national currency their people use currencies such as a US dollar the pen sterling and the euro before the hyperinflation the first in-between dollar was worth about 125 US dollars if that 100 trillion dollar bill was worth that exchange rate that single bill would be worth more money than there s and the entire world twice but as ridiculous as this was this is only considered to be the second worst inflation in history after Hungary in 1940 sex although Zimbabwe's inflation peaked in mid November of 2008 their overall highest monthly inflation was seventy nine point six billion percent whereas Hungary's highest monthly inflation which took place in July 1946 with 41 point 9 quadrillion percent with prices doubling every 15 hours suppose i an't perspective a country with a healthy inflation rate of around 3% precious double every 23 years the currency was called the pengal and as inflation rose the bell pangos introduced short for billion pengal which is actually one trillion Pengo on the short scale as well as the record for the highest monthly inflation hungry also holds the record for the highest denomination bank nor ever issued the 100 million bell penguin note IE 100 million billion which is 100 Quintilian Pengo on the short scale when nel our Bell penguin notes were printed but never issued in 1941 the exchange rate was about 5 pengal to 1 US dollar in 1946 when the currency was discontinued things had gotten so out of hand that if you took every single banknote in the entire country they would have a total value of one tenth of a u.s. pay me hungry then switched to the forint where one formed equals 400 OCH telegin Pengo that number has 29 zeros so that's why governments can just print money to pay off their debt it does not end well it's also important to understand exactly what national dares national debt is much more complicated than personal debt it isn't simply a case of you owe people money take the country with a highest national debt the United States that currently has around 17 trillion dollars a day and you're probably aware the country that holds most US debt as China although that is true it's somewhat misleading of the total debt China only has about 8 percent most of the day is actually owned by the United States government itself by organizations such as Social Security or the Federal Reserve on top of this a further 30 percent is owned by US citizens and even though 8 percent of 17 trillion is still a lot China can't just knock on the door of the White House and demand 1.2 trillion dollars it doesn't work like that basically the US Department of the Treasury issued Treasury bonds you can buy these bonds and the government or pay you interest on that bond every year then once the bonds have matured they'll buy the Treasury bond back from you now if a country gets into financial trouble it may have to default on its debt which basically means you won't get your money back but the u.s. is generally considered an extremely risk-free investment because the US dollar is the most widely used and the most trustworthy currency in the world it's even written into the Constitution that United States cannot default on its debt I'll leave you with this thing of thought and what I think is possibly the best way to sum up why governments can't just print off unlimited amounts of money if money grew on trees it would be as valuable as leaves thanks for watching [Music]"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question":

Do you see it? If you're not color\nblind, it's likely you're seeing a blue dot moving\naround the circle. Try looking at the blue dot\nand you'll find it's not there. Why would your brain\ntell you something's there when it's really not? Well, the shocking truth is that\nthis happens to you every day, especially while you're staring\nat your computer or phone screen. So in here, I've got some red,\nand what's the other color? Green. Passed the first test. And I'm going to\nhave you mix it up. What color do you think\nit's going to turn? If I was in second grade,\nI should remember this, but it should be yellow, right? Red. Brown. Orange. Purplish. Purplish. OK. What is it looking like? Like a brown, dark red? All right, what\ncolor is it turning? Greenish brown. I've got the same color. It's the same paint, actually,\nand I'm going to spin it. What color do you think\nit's going to appear? Brown, but I think this\nis a trick question. OK, so you're going\nto say brown again. You're going to guess brown. I know it's wrong. I know it's wrong. It's a trick question. It has to be. I hope this one's yellow\nand not dookie brown. OK, you hope this one's yellow. What color does\nthat look to you? It looks yellowish. It's like a mustard yellow. Like a mustard yellow. Was it surprising that\nthis kind of dark red and that bright\ngreen made yellow? Yeah, I'm just trying\nto think of why? Why is it happening? Your told in art\nclass that when you mix the three primary\ncolors, red, yellow, and blue, you get brown. And that's true of paint,\nbut it's not true of light. When I spin the red\nand green wheel, there is no yellow light\nthere but you see yellow. Your brain is being tricked\nbecause of how your eyes work. On your retina, you have\nlight sensitive cells called cones that perceive\ncolor, red light, green light, and blue light cones. Some people have\nan extra cone which would allow them to see many\nmore colors than the rest of us, which would be crazy. But typically, we just\nhave the red, green, and blue cones, which\nmeans that there is no cone for orange\nlight or yellow light. But the crazy thing is that\nthese three cones work together to allow you to see\nthe rest of the colors. It works like this. If I shine the yellow\nlight on your eyes, your red cones actually\nrespond a little bit and your green cones\nrespond a little bit, too. Then your brain combines\nthose red and green responses to say that's yellow. Now, if instead\nof yellow light, I shine a little red light\nand a little green light on your eyes, the red cones\nrespond and the green cones respond, and your brain\nsays, red and green, well, that makes yellow-- even\nif there is no yellow light there. This is how your LCD screen\ntricks you into seeing yellow. It's doing that right now. All you're seeing with\nyour eyes is red and green, but your brain is seeing\nyellow, and now blue if you stared long enough\nat that yellow star. This is an effect of how\nyour eyes work as well, and so were the yellow\ndots at the beginning. They have to do with\ncomplementary colors, but don't get this confused\nwith complementary or opposite colors on a paint color wheel. If you mix two of\nthose opposite colors, you get a darker brownish color\nbecause adding more pigments means more colors are absorbed. On a color wheel for a light,\nmixing two complimentary colors gives you white. For example, if I show you\nthis red screen and then the cyan screen, and then\nswitch them back and forth fast enough, you should see white. Here goes.   I really hope that\nworked, and if it did, you'd be making this face\nbecause it's incredible. You mix two colors\nand you get white, but white is all the colors. Or are you perceiving\nall of the colors? If I shine red, green, and\nblue light on your eyes, you're going to see white,\nbecause white light excites all three cones just like\na mix of red, green, and blue light does. Otherwise, this wouldn't\nlook white with just the red, green, and blue\npixels on your RGB screen. So red mixed with\nits opposite color cyan, which is just a mix\nof green and blue light, should look white. And now, you'll\nnotice that blue is the complementary\ncolor of yellow, so together they\nshould make white. When you stare at yellow\nlight for a while, your red and green\ncones continue to respond and\neventually become dulled. When you suddenly switch\nto a white screen, all three cones should\nnow get excited. But blue was the only one\nthat wasn't dulled over time, so it will send a stronger\nsignal to your brain and your brain will tell\nyou there's blue light, even when there is not. But now you know better. [MUSIC PLAYING]  "}, "multiple-choice": []}

I'll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach, and you fly it all the way across the continent, and you drop it into a sloped cage, it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores, and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away. It'll do this for weeks, until it kind of gradually loses the plot. And it's incredible to watch, but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on; it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it. So, we have this ability as well. And in humans, we call it the \"body clock.\" You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground, for a couple of months. (Laughter) People actually volunteer for this, and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole. So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be, they all show the same thing. They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks. And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks, rather than somehow sensing the day outside. So fine, we have a body clock, and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives. It's a huge driver for culture and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior. We evolved as a species near the equator, and so we're very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness. But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada, where I live, we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter. So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture, traditionally has been highly seasonal. In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on; you enjoy your family life inside. And in summer, it's almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours, very active. So, what would our natural rhythm look like? What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense? Well, it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all, they sleep twice every night. They go to bed around 8:00 p.m. until midnight and then again, they sleep from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise. And in-between, they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed. And during this time, there's a surge of prolactin, the likes of which a modern day never sees. The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime, that they realize they're experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives. So, cut to the modern day. We're living in a culture of jet lag, global travel, 24-hour business, shift work. And you know, our modern ways of doing things have their advantages, but I believe we should understand the costs. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

That's a poor use of about 30%\nof the produce on the market, not to mention the water and energy\nrequired to grow and transport it, and the landfill space getting used up\nby rotting fruit. So what are those cosmetic problems? You've probably passed over\na spotty apple in the grocery store, or accidentally sunk your thumb\ninto a mushy patch on a tomato. These blemishes can doom produce\nto the trash can. But what are they anyway, and are they actually bad for you? Those spots are evidence of an epic battle\nbetween plants and microbes. Like humans, plants coexist with billions\nof fungi and bacteria. Some of these microbes are beneficial\nto the plant, suppressing disease and helping it\nextract nutrients. Others are pathogens,\nattacking the produce, still alive as it sits in a store display\nor your refrigerator and siphoning off molecules\nthey can use themselves. The good news is \nthey're almost never bad for you. These fungi and bacteria have spent\nmillions of years developing strategies to overcome\na plant's immune system. But healthy human immune systems\nare different enough that those strategies \njust don't work on us. So in a plant,\nwhat does this process look like? Microbes can reach plants \nin a number of ways, like getting splashed onto it\nduring watering or fertilization. Under the right conditions, the microbes grow \ninto large enough colonies to attack the waxy outer layer \nof fruit or leaves. Their target: the delicious sugars\nand nutrients inside. This type of pathogen often makes\nspots like this. A clump of bacteria drains the nutrients\nand color from the fruit's cells making that yellow halo. It then moves outward, leaving a black spot of dead cells\nin its wake. Each spot, which could contain\nhundreds of thousands of microbes is actually caused by a combination\nof microbial attack and the host defending itself. For example, this is the bacterial\npathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Once on a tomato, \nit enters the fruit and leaves, multiplies in the space between the cells, and produces toxins and proteins that allow it to disrupt \nthe plant's immune response. One toxin coronatine makes plants'\nstomata open up, allowing bacteria to enter \nmore freely. Coronatine also activates pathways\nleading to chlorophyll degradation, which you can see as yellow spots. As the bacteria continue to feed\nand multiply, they start to kill off the plant cells. That explains spots,\nbut what about mushy blemishes? Those are usually caused when the fruit\nis attacked by microbes after it's detached from the plant. If the plant is wounded during transport, necrotic fungi can infiltrate \nthrough the wound, kill the cells, absorb their nutrients, and leave your food \nlooking mushy or brown. Those spots in particular \ncan taste pretty bad. You're eating dead \nand decomposing tissue, after all. But you can usually salvage the rest\nof the fruit. The non-mushy spots, like the ones\nyou typically see on apples or tomatoes, are just on the surface \nand don't usually affect flavor. Of course, microbes that do make us sick,\nlike E. coli and salmonella, can hitch a ride on vegetables, too. But because they're not plant pathogens,\nthey don't typically cause spots. They just hang out \ninvisibly on the surface. So it's washing fruit and veggies,\nnot avoiding the spotty ones, that will help you avoid getting sick. So the next time \nyou're at the grocery store, don't be afraid \nto pick up funky-looking fruit. Some stores will even give you a discount. Wash them well and store them properly, as some produce like apples and cabbages\nwill keep in the fridge for weeks. The spotty ones may not be eye candy,\nbut they're safe and just as delicious."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "You can avoid getting sick from Salmonella and E.coli by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Not eating any fruits or vegetables that have spots."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Washing your fruits and vegetables thoroughly."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only eating organic fruits and vegetables."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eating as many fruits and vegetables as possible."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When you see a strawberry with a fluffy, mushy spot you know that this spot is probably caused by a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Biotrophic pathogen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Necrotrophic pathogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wounding during transport"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nutrient deficiency"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What value of produce was wasted in America in 2010?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "$10"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$1 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$100,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$30 billion"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Coronatine is a bacterial toxin which promotes plant stomatal opening in order to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Slow plant growth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Delay sensing of the bacteria by the plant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Allow the bacteria to enter the plant leaf"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kill plant cells"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "You can avoid getting sick from Salmonella and E. coli by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Not eating any fruits or vegetables that have spots"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Washing your fruits and vegetables thoroughly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only eating organic fruits and vegetables"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eating as many fruits and vegetables as possible"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Food waste is a problem because it:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Takes a lot of resources like land, water and fertilizer to grow the food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Food transport requires a lot of energy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Farmers can’t sell misshapen produce, even if its otherwise safe to eat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Why is that? Why don't we get unicellular elephants, or blue whales, or brown bears? To find out, we have to peer into\na cell's guts. This is where most \nof the cell's functions occur, enclosed by a cellular membrane that acts as the doorway into \nand out of the cell. Any resources the cell needs to consume, or waste products it needs to expel, first have to pass through this membrane. But there's a biological quirk \nin this set up. A cell's surface and volume increase\nat different rates. Cells come in many shapes, but imagining them as cubes will make\nthe math easy to calculate. A cube has six faces. These represent the cell membrane,\nand make up its surface area. A cube measuring one micrometer\non each side, that's one millionth of a meter, would have a total surface area\nof six square micrometers. And its volume would be \none cubic micrometer. This would give us six units \nof surface area for every single unit of volume, a six to one ratio. But things change dramatically\nif we make the cube ten times bigger, measuring ten micrometers on each side. This cell would have a surface area\nof 600 square micrometers and a volume of one thousand\ncubic micrometers, a ratio of only .6 to one. That's less than one unit of surface area\nto service each unit of volume. As the cube grows, its volume increases\nmuch faster than its surface area. The interior would overtake the membrane, leaving too little surface area for things\nto quickly move in and out of the cell. A huge cell would back up with waste\nand eventually die and disintegrate. There's another plus to having multitudes\nof smaller cells, too. It's hardly a tragedy if one gets \npunctured, infected, or destroyed. Now, there are some \nexceptionally large cells that have adapted to cheat the system, like the body's longest cell, a neuron that stretches from the base\nof the spine to the foot. To compensate for its length,\nit's really thin, just a few micrometers in diameter. Another example can be found\nin your small intestine, where structures called villi\nfold up into little fingers. Each villus is made of cells with highly\nfolded membranes that have tiny bumps called microvilli\nto increase their surface area. But what about single-celled organisms? Caulerpa taxifolia, a green algae\nthat can reach 30 centimeters long, is believed to be the largest \nsingle-celled organism in the world thanks to its unique biological hacks. Its surface area is enhanced with\na frond-like structure. It uses photosynthesis to assemble\nits own food molecules and it's coenocytic. That means it's a single cell\nwith multiple nuclei, making it like a multicellular organism\nbut without the divisions between cells. Yet even the biggest unicellular organisms\nhave limits, and none grows nearly as large\nas the elephant, whale, or bear. But within every big creature\nare trillions of minuscule cells perfectly suited in all their tininess to keeping the Earth's giants \nlumbering along."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "As cells get larger, which of the following is true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The surface area of the cell increases faster than its volume."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The volume of the cell increases faster than its surface area."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The surface area and volume of a cell increase at the same rate."}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is no relationship between the volume of a cell and its surface area."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is believed to be one of the largest single-celled organisms in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Caulerpa taxifolia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Blue whale"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Zika virus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Escherichia coli"}, {"label": "E", "text": "African elephant"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What part of the cell serves as the doorway into and out of the cell?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nucleus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ribosome"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cell membrane"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Endoplasmic reticulum"}, {"label": "E", "text": "DNA"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "As cells get larger, which of the following is true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The surface area of the cell increases faster than its volume"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The volume of the cell increases faster than its surface area"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The surface area and volume of a cell increase at the same rate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is no relationship between the volume of a cell and its surface area"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following are ways that cells can increase the amount of surface area per unit of volume? 1.

{"page": 37, "lesson": 9, "title": "This Video Will Make You Angry", "category": "Information Literacy", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/4eO5p5eB", "transcript": {"en": "Hello Internet. Thoughts compete for space in your brain:\ncat photos, news stories, beliefs structures, funny GIFs, educational videos, not-so-educational\nvideos and your thinking inventory is limited. A thought without a brain to think it, dies. Now we can treat thoughts as though they're\nalive. Specifically alive like germs. That might sound weird but stick with me. Take jokes. Jokes are thought germs that live\nin your brain -- and when you tell the joke to another brain, you help it reproduce. Just like when you have the flu and sneeze\nto help it reproduce. This germ gets into its host by snot through the mouth and this\none by words through the ear but it's reproduction either way. Logging on to your social media then, is exposing\nyourself to everyone's mental sneezes. Each post a glob of snot with an thought germ trying\nto get in your brain -- if not for permanent residence then at least long enough to get\nyou to press the share button and sneeze it with everyone you know. In this analogy then, a funny cat photo with\na perfect caption is a super-flu. Now just as germs exploit weak points in your\nimmune system, so do thought germs exploit weak points in your brain. A.K.A. emotions. Once inside, thought germs that press emotional\nbuttons get their hosts to spread them more -- measurably more. Well, except sadness,\nsad thought germs don't get very far. Awe is pretty good which is why websites that\nconstruct thought germs like biological weapons arm them with them titles like \"7 whatevers\nthat will blow your mind\" or \"The Shocking Secret behind... this thing\" But anger is the ultimate edge for a thought\ngerm. Anger, bypasses your mental immune system, and compels you to share it. Being aware of your brain's weak spots is\nnecessary for good mental hygiene -- like knowing how to wash your hands. Because even\nwithout intentional construction, any thought germ on the Internet can, on its own, grow\nmore infections as it spreads. To talk about why, lets forget anger for a moment and go\nback to that cat photo. Every photo ever taken is a thought germ,\nand most die a quick death like the bazillion cat photos (or baby photos) posted on The\nInternet that are never shared. But a mildly funny cat photo can grow into so much more,\nbecause just as transatlantic flights were the best thing to happen to germ germs, so\nthe Internet is the best thing to happen to thought germs. For once on-board, that cat photo is a thought\ngerm that can leap into other brains. And those brains might share it, and here's the\nkey point, occasionally, change it -- a Photoshop here, a tweaked caption there. Most changes are terrible, but some make the\nthought germ even funnier, getting brains to share it more. Which results in more changes\nand a shot at super-stardom. A thus a lowly cat photo can achieve global brain domination.\nAt least for a few hours. The Internet, with its unparalleled ability\nto share and randomly change thought germs can't help but help make them stronger. With jokes, that's awesome -- but with angry\ngerms not always so awesome. No. Angry germs, the more they're shared undergo\nthe same process, changing and distorting to be more aggravating. These have a better\nchance of spreading than their more accurate but more boring rivals. But like plagues, thought germs can burn though\na population too quickly. Just watch your favorite meme generating machine for a week\nand you'll see the life-cycle fly by. However some thought germs have found a way\naround burnout. Now, I must warn you, depending on which thought germs live in your head and\nwhich you fight for, the next section might sound *horrifying*. So please keep in mind,\nwe're going to talk about what makes some thought germs, particularly angry ones, successful\nand not how good or bad they are. OK? Deep breath: calm. Though germs can burn out because once everyone\nagrees, it's hard to keep talking and thus thinking about them. But if there's an opposing thought germ, an\nargument, then the thinking never stops. Disagrement doesn't have to be angry, but again, angry\nhelps. The more visible an argument gets the more bystanders it draws in which makes it\nmore visible is why every group from the most innocuous internet forum to The National Conversation\ncan turn into a double rage storm across the sky in no time. Wait, these though germs aren't competing,\nthey're co-operating. Working together they reach more brains and hold their thoughts\nlonger than they could alone. Thought germs on opposite sides of an argument can be symbiotic. One tool symbiotic anger germs in particular\ncan employ is your-with-us-or-against-us. Whatever thought germ just leaped to the front\nof your brain, push it back. This video isn't about that. We're just talking about the tool,\nand this one makes it hard, for neutral brains to resist and its diviciveness also grows\nits symbiotic partner. This explains why, in some arguments gaining\nmore allies also gains more enemies. Because though the participants think they're involved\nin a firey battle to the death from the anger germs perspective one side is a field of flowers\nand the other a flock of butterflies. *Of course* planting more flowers will get you\nmore butterflies and getting more butterflies will pollinate more flowers. If there is some argument that splits the\npopulation and lasts forever that even the most neutral people find difficult to avoid,\nyou just might be looking at a super successful pair of symbiotic anger germs that have reached\necological stability Now, one final depressing though. Uhhhh…\nI mean one more Awe inspiring point, that will reveal the secrets of, ahhh -- actually\nno it's just depressing. When opposing groups get big they don't really\nargue with each other, they *mostly* argue with themselves about how angry the *other*\ngroup makes them. We can actually graph fights on the Internet to see this in action. Each\nbecomes its own quasi isolated internet, sharing thoughts about the other. You see where this is going, right? Each group becomes a breeding ground for thought\ngerms *about* the other -- and as before the most enraging -- but not necessarily the most\naccurate -- spread fastest. A group almost can't help but construct a totem of the other\nso enraging they talk about it all the time -- which, now that you know how though germs\ngrow, is exactly what make the totem always perfectly maddening. Now, all this isn't to say that there's no\npoint in arguing. (That's a different video). Or that the Internet isn't amazing, or that\nthere aren't things worth trying to change peoples' minds about. And thought germs of\nall kinds come and go. But it's useful to be aware of how thought\ncan use our emotions to spread and how the more rapidly a thought is able to spread the\nmore chances it has to become *even better* at spreading through random changes made to\nit. Sometimes that's great, sometimes it's terrible. But if you want to maintain a healthy brain\nit pays to be cautious of thoughts that have passed through a lot of other brains and that\npoke you where you are weakest. It's your brain -- be hygienic with it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Thoughts that incite which emotion are most likely to be shared on the internet?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "sadness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "joy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "awe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "anger"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When triggered, which emotion is least likely to induce you to share an idea on the internet?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "sadness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "joy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "awe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "anger"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 37, "lesson": 10, "title": "How to stay calm when you know you'll be stressed", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/Ge4NK6fZ", "transcript": {"en": "A few years ago,\nI broke into my own house. I had just driven home, it was around midnight\nin the dead of Montreal winter, I had been visiting my friend,\nJeff, across town, and the thermometer on the front porch\nread minus 40 degrees -- and don't bother asking\nif that's Celsius or Fahrenheit, minus 40 is where the two scales meet -- it was very cold. And as I stood on the front porch\nfumbling in my pockets, I found I didn't have my keys. In fact, I could see them\nthrough the window, lying on the dining room table\nwhere I had left them. So I quickly ran around\nand tried all the other doors and windows, and they were locked tight. I thought about calling a locksmith --\nat least I had my cellphone, but at midnight, it could take a while\nfor a locksmith to show up, and it was cold. I couldn't go back to my friend\nJeff's house for the night because I had an early flight\nto Europe the next morning, and I needed to get\nmy passport and my suitcase. So, desperate and freezing cold, I found a large rock and I broke\nthrough the basement window, cleared out the shards of glass, I crawled through, I found a piece of cardboard\nand taped it up over the opening, figuring that in the morning,\non the way to the airport, I could call my contractor\nand ask him to fix it. This was going to be expensive, but probably no more expensive\nthan a middle-of-the-night locksmith, so I figured, under the circumstances,\nI was coming out even. Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training and I know a little bit\nabout how the brain performs under stress. It releases cortisol\nthat raises your heart rate, it modulates adrenaline levels and it clouds your thinking. So the next morning, when I woke up on too little sleep, worrying about the hole in the window, and a mental note\nthat I had to call my contractor, and the freezing temperatures, and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe, and, you know, with all\nthe cortisol in my brain, my thinking was cloudy, but I didn't know it was cloudy\nbecause my thinking was cloudy. (Laughter) And it wasn't until I got\nto the airport check-in counter, that I realized I didn't have my passport. (Laughter) So I raced home in the snow\nand ice, 40 minutes, got my passport,\nraced back to the airport, I made it just in time, but they had given away\nmy seat to someone else, so I got stuck in the back of the plane,\nnext to the bathrooms, in a seat that wouldn't recline,\non an eight-hour flight. Well, I had a lot of time to think\nduring those eight hours and no sleep. (Laughter) And I started wondering,\nare there things that I can do, systems that I can put into place, that will prevent bad things\nfrom happening? Or at least if bad things happen, will minimize the likelihood\nof it being a total catastrophe. So I started thinking about that, but my thoughts didn't crystallize\nuntil about a month later. I was having dinner with my colleague,\nDanny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner, and I somewhat embarrassedly told him\nabout having broken my window, and, you know, forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that he'd been practicing\nsomething called prospective hindsight. (Laughter) It's something that he had gotten\nfrom the psychologist Gary Klein, who had written about it\na few years before, also called the pre-mortem. Now, you all know what the postmortem is. Whenever there's a disaster, a team of experts come in and they try\nto figure out what went wrong, right? Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained, you look ahead and you try to figure out\nall the things that could go wrong, and then you try to figure out\nwhat you can do to prevent those things from happening,\nor to minimize the damage. So what I want to talk to you about today are some of the things we can do\nin the form of a pre-mortem. Some of them are obvious,\nsome of them are not so obvious. I'll start with the obvious ones. Around the home, designate a place\nfor things that are easily lost. Now, this sounds\nlike common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science\nto back this up, based on the way our spatial memory works. There's a structure in the brain\ncalled the hippocampus, that evolved over tens\nof thousands of years, to keep track of the locations\nof important things -- where the well is,\nwhere fish can be found, that stand of fruit trees, where the friendly and enemy tribes live. The hippocampus is the part of the brain that in London taxicab drivers\nbecomes enlarged. It's the part of the brain\nthat allows squirrels to find their nuts. And if you're wondering,\nsomebody actually did the experiment where they cut off\nthe olfactory sense of the squirrels, and they could still find their nuts. They weren't using smell,\nthey were using the hippocampus, this exquisitely evolved mechanism\nin the brain for finding things. But it's really good for things\nthat don't move around much, not so good for things that move around. So this is why we lose car keys\nand reading glasses and passports. So in the home,\ndesignate a spot for your keys -- a hook by the door,\nmaybe a decorative bowl. For your passport, a particular drawer. For your reading glasses,\na particular table. If you designate a spot\nand you're scrupulous about it, your things will always be there\nwhen you look for them. What about travel? Take a cell phone picture\nof your credit cards, your driver's license, your passport, mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud. If these things are lost or stolen,\nyou can facilitate replacement. Now these are some rather obvious things. Remember, when you're under stress,\nthe brain releases cortisol. Cortisol is toxic,\nand it causes cloudy thinking. So part of the practice of the pre-mortem is to recognize that under stress\nyou're not going to be at your best, and you should put systems in place. And there's perhaps\nno more stressful a situation than when you're confronted\nwith a medical decision to make. And at some point, all of us\nare going to be in that position, where we have to make\na very important decision about the future of our medical care\nor that of a loved one, to help them with a decision. And so I want to talk about that. And I'm going to talk about\na very particular medical condition. But this stands as a proxy for all kinds\nof medical decision-making, and indeed for financial decision-making,\nand social decision-making -- any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational\nassessment of the facts. So suppose you go to your doctor\nand the doctor says, \"I just got your lab work back,\nyour cholesterol's a little high.\" Now, you all know that high cholesterol is associated with an increased risk\nof cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke. And so you're thinking having high cholesterol\nisn't the best thing, and so the doctor says,\n\"You know, I'd like to give you a drug that will help you\nlower your cholesterol, a statin.\" And you've probably heard of statins, you know that they're among\nthe most widely prescribed drugs in the world today, you probably even know\npeople who take them. And so you're thinking,\n\"Yeah! Give me the statin.\" But there's a question\nyou should ask at this point, a statistic you should ask for that most doctors\ndon't like talking about, and pharmaceutical companies\nlike talking about even less. It's for the number needed to treat. Now, what is this, the NNT? It's the number of people\nthat need to take a drug or undergo a surgery\nor any medical procedure before one person is helped. And you're thinking,\nwhat kind of crazy statistic is that? The number should be one. My doctor wouldn't prescribe\nsomething to me if it's not going to help. But actually, medical practice\ndoesn't work that way. And it's not the doctor's fault, if it's anybody's fault,\nit's the fault of scientists like me. We haven't figured out\nthe underlying mechanisms well enough. But GlaxoSmithKline estimates that 90 percent of the drugs work\nin only 30 to 50 percent of the people. So the number needed to treat\nfor the most widely prescribed statin, what do you suppose it is? How many people have to take it\nbefore one person is helped? 300. This is according to research by research practitioners\nJerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband, independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com. I ran through the numbers myself. 300 people have to\ntake the drug for a year before one heart attack, stroke\nor other adverse event is prevented. Now you're probably thinking, \"Well, OK, one in 300 chance\nof lowering my cholesterol. Why not, doc? Give me\nthe prescription anyway.\" But you should ask at this point\nfor another statistic, and that is, \"Tell me\nabout the side effects.\" Right? So for this particular drug, the side effects occur\nin five percent of the patients. And they include terrible things -- debilitating muscle and joint pain,\ngastrointestinal distress -- but now you're thinking, \"Five percent, not very likely\nit's going to happen to me, I'll still take the drug.\" But wait a minute. Remember under stress\nyou're not thinking clearly. So think about how you're going\nto work through this ahead of time, so you don't have to manufacture\nthe chain of reasoning on the spot. 300 people take the drug, right?\nOne person's helped, five percent of those 300\nhave side effects, that's 15 people. You're 15 times more likely\nto be harmed by the drug than you are to be helped by the drug. Now, I'm not saying whether you\nshould take the statin or not. I'm just saying you should have\nthis conversation with your doctor. Medical ethics requires it, it's part of the principle\nof informed consent. You have the right to have access\nto this kind of information to begin the conversation about whether\nyou want to take the risks or not. Now you might be thinking I've pulled this number\nout of the air for shock value, but in fact it's rather typical,\nthis number needed to treat. For the most widely performed surgery\non men over the age of 50, removal of the prostate for cancer, the number needed to treat is 49. That's right, 49 surgeries are done\nfor every one person who's helped. And the side effects in that case\noccur in 50 percent of the patients. They include impotence,\nerectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, rectal tearing, fecal incontinence. And if you're lucky, and you're one\nof the 50 percent who has these, they'll only last for a year or two. So the idea of the pre-mortem\nis to think ahead of time to the questions\nthat you might be able to ask that will push the conversation forward. You don't want to have to manufacture\nall of this on the spot. And you also want to think\nabout things like quality of life. Because you have a choice oftentimes, do you I want a shorter life\nthat's pain-free, or a longer life that might have\na great deal of pain towards the end? These are things to talk about\nand think about now, with your family and your loved ones. You might change your mind\nin the heat of the moment, but at least you're practiced\nwith this kind of thinking. Remember, our brain under stress\nreleases cortisol, and one of the things\nthat happens at that moment is a whole bunch on systems shut down. There's an evolutionary reason for this. Face-to-face with a predator,\nyou don't need your digestive system, or your libido, or your immune system, because if you're body is expending\nmetabolism on those things and you don't react quickly, you might become the lion's lunch,\nand then none of those things matter. Unfortunately, one of the things that goes out the window\nduring those times of stress is rational, logical thinking, as Danny Kahneman\nand his colleagues have shown. So we need to train ourselves\nto think ahead to these kinds of situations. I think the important point here\nis recognizing that all of us are flawed. We all are going to fail now and then. The idea is to think ahead\nto what those failures might be, to put systems in place\nthat will help minimize the damage, or to prevent the bad things\nfrom happening in the first place. Getting back to that\nsnowy night in Montreal, when I got back from my trip, I had my contractor install\na combination lock next to the door, with a key to the front door in it,\nan easy to remember combination. And I have to admit, I still have piles of mail\nthat haven't been sorted, and piles of emails\nthat I haven't gone through. So I'm not completely organized, but I see organization\nas a gradual process, and I'm getting there. Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

A lot can change over the course of a century. In the early 20th century, Einstein wrote\nhis theory of relativity. In 1953, Dr. Jonas Salk announced that he\nhad successfully created a polio vaccine. And in 1990, the world wide web was invented. But what about changes over a longer period\nof time, like a few million years? Obviously, the Earth was a drastically different\nplace, but it makes me wonder: could you, a modern human, survive on Earth 2.5 million\nyears ago? To start off, let’s talk about the environment. You, my friend, would be living in the Pleistocene\nEpoch, which spanned from 2.6 millions years ago to 11,700 years ago. This was the time period in which the most\nrecent ice ages took place. During the peak periods where most of the\nwater on Earth was ice, the global average temperatures were 5 to 10 degrees Celsius\ncolder than they are today. This was a much cooler and drier Earth. So already, unless you have an incredibly\ninsulating jacket, your chances of survival are looking pretty slim. During this time, you may also have bumped\ninto one of your earliest human ancestors -- homo habilis. This species looked more like apes than humans,\nbut were able to walk on their back legs and use their hands to make stone tools, hence\nits name, which means “handy man”. But, luckily for you, if you encountered one\nof them, scientists are unsure if it would attack. The general consensus is that homo habilis\nwere vegetarians and did not hunt anything but small game. So, in this sense, you may not be in direct\nharm. But what about diseases? The prevailing idea on the origin of human\ndiseases is that many of them arose once animals were domesticated. However, with new data, it’s thought that\ndiseases like tapeworms, mycobacterial infections, tuberculosis, and leprosy were around during\nthe Pleistocene Epoch. And scientists believe that the bacteria B.\nbronchiseptica, which infected hominids 2.5 million years ago, may have evolved into the\nbacteria that is now responsible for whooping cough. And even more, scientists have recently determined\nthat the parasites that cause malaria were around 2.5 million years ago. The parasites were relatively benign at that\ntime, and malaria only became a major disease after agriculture and dense human populations\narose. But if you were living 2.5 million years ago,\nwithout access to any of today’s medicine, you would probably not make it too long. Well that’s quite a sad note to end on. To lighten the mood a bit, let me know what\nyou would most want to see from 2.5 million years ago. Make sure you come back every Monday for a\nbrand new video. As always, I’m Blocko and this has been\nLife Noggin. Don’t forget to keep on thinking!"}, "multiple-choice": []}

When you call customer service and hear this \"to ensure quality service your call may be monitored or recorded\",\nthey're not kidding. Over the last year the Marchex Institute\nanalysed more than 600,000 recorded phone conversations Americans made to businesses in the United States. Turns out, people from Ohio were the most likely to use curse words - the 'A' word, \nthe 'F' word and the 'S' word. Washington state residents were\nthe least likely to use bad words. But what makes a word bad? Oh, be careful because etymologically speaking even the word 'bad' can be considered a bad word. It began in old English as a derogatory term for an effeminate man.\nEighty percent of swear words overheard in public in 1986, 1997 and 2006 were essentially the same.\nOne third of all counts included the top two - the 'F' word and the 'S' word. Slate's brilliant Lexicon Valley podcast purported that these 10 words makeup about 0.7% of the average English speakers daily vocabulary, which means socially unacceptable words are used almost as often as socially descriptive words.\nFirst person plural pronouns account for about 1% of the words we say everyday. When a bad word is bleeped, it is covered with a 1 kilohertz sine wave, which sounds like this. Son of a ... By the way, the symbols and\nsquiggles that are used to represent a bad word have a name.\nThey're called grawlixes. They were named by Mort Walker in his seminal \"The Lexicon of Comicana.\" \nHe names a lot of things but most of them show stuff, they don't hide stuff. Why the need to hide bad words, especially if we all pretty much know what's being said?\nWell, there is no one single reason bad words are bad. Steven Pinker in his excellent lecture\non the topic delineates five types of swearing.\nFirst of all, some words are bad on purpose.\nThey are created and/or used with the intent to hurt others.\nHe calls this \"abusive swearing.\" Using words to insult, humiliate, objectify or marginalise disfavoured people. Now, if that this disfavoured person is God, we're talking about supernatural swearing, which was particularly taboo in Victorian times. It was believed that casually or vainly referring to God would physically injure God himself, literally. So, at the time people were\nforced to come up with euphemisms, like \"Zounds!\" and \"Gadzooks!\", which  originally meant \"God's Wounds!\" and \"God's Hooks!\", referring to the nails driven through the hands of Jesus. Historically, swear words often\ncame from things we were afraid of, things we perceived as dangerous, stronger than us and mercurial. Such as death, disease and infirmity, sex and sexually transmitted diseases,\nas well as body fluids, germy, gross effluvia. Words for those gross things became gross\nand bad in and of themselves, uncouth to speak. But not all words for gross things are socially unacceptable, which brings us to Pinker's second type of swearing - emphatic swearing. Emphatic swearing is where the\ntaboo-ness of bad words becomes quite practical.\nYou wouldn't usually use those words but when you really want to convey that your current\nemotions matter more to you than proper social conduct, you can use them. Dysphemism. A euphemism is kind, acceptable word\nthat allows you to talk about something unpleasant while simultaneously letting everyone know you totally get that it's unpleasant and want to respect that. For instance, if you want to be\nprofessional, you wouldn't say s***. You might say 'defecate'. If, on the other hand,\nyou really want to drive home just how unpleasant the experience was, dysphemisms can help out a lot. It wasn't a bag of canine defecation you found on your front porch, it was a s*** bag of hot dog s***.\nBoth of these words refer to pretty much the same thing but they have different levels of\nsocial acceptability and that's very helpful. It means word choice allows us to not only refer to things in the real world but also to how we feel about them. If both these words had the same level\nof social acceptance we might even have to find new, badder\nwords so as not to lose the power language currently has to express emotion, repulsion and disgust. But when it comes to two words\nreferring to the same thing, but with different levels of social acceptance,\nwho decides which one's good and which one's bad?\nWell, historically, many of the bad words we use today are the result of class differences. In medieval England, the lower-class Saxons spoke a Germanic tongue while the upper-class Normans spoke a language related to French and Latin. English, as we know it today,\ncontains many consequences of their differences. \nThe lower class worked with animals and from them we get animal names. The upper class only ate the animals, which is where\nthe names of the meat come from. Today's swear words are similar.\nDefecation stems from fancy pants Latin, whereas the less classy s*** is Germanic. There's also idiomatic swearing, where nothing is being emphasized. No dysphemism is meant;\ninstead, it's an easygoing type of swearing that shows an atmosphere is casual. Bad words can be used,\nwe're all close here. It's okay to swear, we're all cool. Cathartic swearing is a bit different. It gives us \"lalochezia,\" the medical term for the relief swearing provides when you're in pain. In the brain, swearing seems to involve different regions\nthan regular language, which may explain why people with\naphasia caused by brain damage struggle to comprehend or construct spoken words but yet are fluent at swearing. Or why people with coprolalia control normal language just fine, but involuntarily utter profanity, an obscene words. It turns out swearing may be centralized in the limbic system, along with the motions.\nMany animals make automatic noises when in pain or threat to startle or intimidate attackers, or to let others know what's going on. In humans, bad words are great for this purpose. Their taboo-ness makes them special.\nPeople wouldn't use them otherwise, so they are great alarms. Swearing is changing.\nSome bad words are being used more and more frequently. Of the seven words, George\nCarlin said you could never say on television. Today, every second 22 of them are sent out on Twitter. So, what will swearing look like in the future? It probably won't go away altogether, it's too useful. But the words we don't like will likely change. History has shown that as disease\nbecomes less scary and sex and the supernatural more personal, words related to them \nbecome less taboo and more common; \nwhereas words that were common in the past are increasingly unpleasant. Perhaps, in the future, spurt not by runaway political correctness but by wider knowledge, words like \"schizo\", \"mental\", \"aspy\", or even \"depressed\" will take the square stage. Or as John McWhorter ventured,\nwords centered around class and the gap between opportunity and disadvantage will become more taboo. Salt of the Earth, trash, chav, pikey, urban as a pejorative. When McKay Hatch started a \"No Cussing Club\" at his school, his campaign became the\ntarget of so many online jokes and insults for being lame or anti-free speech. On his book, he literally subtitled his own name \"the most cyberbullied kid in the world.\" People care about this stuff.\nIs it censorship to tell us what we can and cannot say or is it a safety seal, ensuring certain\ndysphemisms don't get worn down to a quotidian bluntness like every other word? Or is that badness of bad words a boundary, a moving boundary of we reject - sometimes arbitrary, sometimes irrational, but always moving\nin the direction of acceptance moving forward? Crime and inequality have existed ever since they could. But when N.W.A released a\nreaction, in the form of a song with bad word in the title, \"F*** the Police\",\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigations released a statement against the song.\nIt was the only time, up until then and since,\nthe FBI has ever issued an official statement about a work of art. Bad words have power. If you wanna push for change you'll need something to push. If everything's fine, nothing's cool. So, bad words are the precipitate of a larger reaction - the process of us slowly becoming what we want to become. That's some deep s***. And as always,  thanks for watching."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The top ten swear words make up what percentage of the average English speaker's daily conversation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": ".01%"}, {"label": "C", "text": ".7%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4.1%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What was the most taboo type of swearing during the Victorian era?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Abusive swearing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Supernatural swearing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Emphatic swearing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dysphemism"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

It caused both the first mass extinction\nin Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen\nmolecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this\nas single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei \nor any other organelles is a pivotal chapter \nin the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always \nthe oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere\nwas mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up \nin molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by\nanaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms\nthat thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging\nwhat molecules they find. But somewhere between \n2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating \non the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane\ncould harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water\ninto oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors\nof what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from \nthe blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria\na huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply \nof raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere\nwith a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was\nsoaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen\nfaster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up\nin the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest\nof Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air \nwas actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass\nextinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this\nthe Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent\ngreenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with\nmethane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, \nand possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically \none giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms, \nwhich can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess\ngas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached \nthe approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use \nthe chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed\nto diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part \nto play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe\nswallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired\nits own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out \nphotosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around\nin almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen\ninto the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to\nfertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth\nwithout them.

It's fun to play with, and to watch what happens when you introduce a magnet. Start, by taking a bottle of Elmer's Glue. You might find other PVA glue also works. Take the top off, and empty it out into a bowl. Fill the bottle halfway with water. Screw the lid back on and give it a good shake, to clean the inside of the bottle. Then empty it in to the bowl as well. Next, we need a packet of Borax powder. Take a tablespoonful. And stir it into a small jug of water until it dissolves. If you haven't got any Borax powder, you could try using a laundry detergent like Tide or a bottle of liquid starch. You can check the ingredients to see if they contain Borax. And carefully use some of that instead of the solution i'm making now. Next, we need to mix the PVA, and slowly pour in a small amount of the Borax solution. You don't need a lot, you can always add more later. Keep mixing it with your spoon and you should find very quickly it starts to clump together and looks slimy. Keep on mixing it and after a while, you can use your hands to mold it all together. Keep ongoing and you should end up with a nice ball of slime like this. Pretty cool, huh? It strechy and slimy and really fun to play with. You can put it on the table, and carefully watch it melt into a blob. To make it magnetic, we're going to add some iron filings. Pour some on to the slime. And work it into the mixture. I'm adding a little bit more, and really folding it in. You need to make sure, theres no pockets of filings, like this which haven't been mixed in. So keep ongoing. And when it's ready, you should have a light grey slime. Now if we take a magnet, and hold it close by, you can see how it reacts. The slime's attracted to the magnet and you can make it move. You've got to be quick or it'll stick to the magnet. These neodymium magnets are really powerful. And you can watch what happens, when they get stuck into the slime. Pretty cool, huh? I have speeded up some of the footage, so it's quicker to watch. It can be difficult to get the slime and the iron filings back off the magnet. You can stack magnets, to make them stronger. And carefully watch what happens as the slime jumps up. And wraps itself around. It's great fun to play around with. And watch it all move. If you try to keep this slime, to use again on a later day, you'll probably find the iron filings have gotten rusty and turned it all brown and disgusting. So I wouldn't try keeping it.

But today, I want to tell\nyou why his work really is interesting and worth\nyour consideration. Here's the case for Andy Warhol. You know him to look like this. But Andrew Warhola\nwas born in Pittsburgh to Slovakian immigrant\nparents and started out looking like this. He grew up sickly and\nspend a lot of time at home drawing with his mom. But he eventually\nescaped to New York, after graduating from\nCarnegie Tech in 1949. He changed his name and\nquickly became a success as a commercial illustrator. He developed a\nsignature technique that allowed him to trace\nand copy images and create a delicate blotted line. It was an early instance of\nhis affinity for automation or finding other people\nor processes that do the work for and with him. He was determined to make it in\nthe field of so-called fine art and started shopping\nfor a way in. Instead of making art\nfor advertisements, he started making\nadvertisements as art, choosing subject matter\nthat would find traction with the emerging\nfield of pop art. He made paintings of Coca\nCola; S&H green stamps; and, of course,\nCampbell's soup cans. He saw these things\nas a common language, saying what's great about this\ncountry is that America started the tradition where the richest\nconsumers by essentially the same things as the poorest. And it wasn't about the\nindividual things so much as the sheer\nabundance of things, which reflected the spread of\nmass manufacturing and growing postwar American\nconsumer culture. Warhol started out\nusing rubber stamps and stencils to make\nthese paintings. But soon landed\non silk screening as a way to speed things up. He created his\nwell-known factory and set to work with\nassistants, rolling out product after product, displaying them\nin warehouse-like arrangements. He was also interested in\nproducts of the human variety and started making\npaintings of celebrities, reproducing images from\npublicity stills, newspapers, and magazines, making shrew\ncommentary on the celebrity as commodity. There are number of subjects\nthat recur Warhol's work, shoes, products, money,\ncelebrities, rich people, disaster, death, himself; shoes,\nproducts, money, celebrities, rich people, disaster,\ndeath, himself. But these weren't just\nWarhol's obsessions. They are deeply reflective\nof the culture of the time. If you ascribed to the theory\nthat the 20th century was the American century,\nthen Warhol's work takes on even more importance. His work charts the\ndevelopment of our obsession with fame and questions the\ngrowing commercialization and uniformity of most\nareas of American life. Warhol was an extremely\nastute businessperson, who formed his first\ncorporate entity, Andy Warhol Enterprises, in 1957. And he never really\nstopped working for hire. He made thousands of\ncommissioned portraits, the first of which was this one\nof art collector Ethel Scull, based on photos taken\nby a machine or rather a photo booth. By the 1970s,\ncommissioned portraits were a solid chunk\nof Warhol's income. Anyone could have their\nportrait made for $25,000, with additional canvases\navailable at discounted rates. Along with his services,\nWarhol was also keen to trade on his\nown image, creating numerous self-portraits\nthroughout his career and offering himself\nup for endorsements. And, of course,\nWarhol was not just an artist, but also a\nfilmmaker, band manager, magazine publisher,\nand TV producer, who fearlessly explored\nand embraced new media. From the 1950s until his\nuntimely death in 1987, Warhol was a shape shifter,\nalways open to the new, always innovating, and\nalways reflecting the time. Like Jay Z, but far\nearlier, he understood that to be an artist\nin a market economy meant not being a businessman,\nbut being a business, man. And he turned himself into\na globally recognized brand. People debate whether\nWarhol defined an ad-driven, factory-made\nculture or was defined by it. But his work remains important\nbecause what mattered to Warhol proved prophetic. People called him a sellout. But by laying bare the\nrelationship between commerce and art, Warhol nullified\nthe very idea of a sellout. And in the process\nmade possible the work Jeff Koons, Shepard Fairey, and\nso many contemporary artists.

First, as you travel along \nthe Great Harbor, keep your eyes open \nfor large columns and statues. Across the bay to your left is the island\nwhere the Great Lighthouse once stood. And as you make your way through\nthe palaces of the Royal Quarter and reach the area where\nthe Library of Alexandria once stood, keep your eyes open for sharks. Because if you visit this section\nof Alexandria, you'll be fifteen feet deep\nin the Mediterranean Sea. Though people are most familiar\nwith Plato's fictional Atlantis, many real underwater cities \nactually exist. Places like Alexandria, Port Royal, Jamaica, and Pavlopetri, Greece. Sunken cities are studied by scientists to help us understand the lives\nof our ancestors, the dynamic nature of our planet, and the impact of each on the other. Water is essential for life,\nfood sources, and transport, so many cities have been built\nalong coast lines and river banks. However, these benefits also come\nwith risks because natural forces that can sink\na city are at their doorstep. Take, for instance, an earthquake. June 7, 1692 seemed like a normal morning\nin Port Royal, Jamaica, then one of the richest ports \nin the world, but when a massive earthquake struck, two-thirds of Port Royal immediately\nsank to its rooftops. Today, many buildings \nand elements of everyday life remain surprisingly intact \non the sea floor, frozen in time. That includes a 300-year-old pocket watch\nthat stopped at 11:43, the moment Port Royal slipped\nbeneath the Carribean. And during the winter of 373 BCE, the Greek city of Helike was struck\nby an earthquake so strong that it liquefied the sandy ground\nupon which the city was built. Minutes later, a tsunami struck the city, and Helike and its inhabitants\nsunk downwards into the Mediterranean Sea. Centuries later, Roman tourists would sail\non the lagoon that formed and peer down at the city's remains. Earthquakes are sudden, \nunpredictable disasters that have drowned cities in an instant. Luckily, however, throughout history, the majority of sunken cities were not\nsubmerged by a single cataclysmic event, but by a combination \nof more gradual processes. For instance, Pavlopetri,\nthe oldest known sunken city, was built on the southern coastline\nof Greece 5,000 years ago. It's an example of a city\nthat was submerged due to what is called \nisostatic sea level change. 18,000 years ago when the Ice Age ended, glaciers began melting and the sea level\nrose globally until about 5,000 years ago. Isostatic sea level change isn't caused\nby that melt water, but rather the Earth's crust slowly\nspringing back from the released weight of the glaciers, making some places rise,\nand others sink. The ground around Pavlopetri\nis still sinking at an average rate \nof a millimeter per year. But the ancient inhabitants were able\nto move gradually inland over several generations before they finally abandoned the city\nabout 3,000 years ago. Today, divers swim over the streets\nof Pavlopetri and peer through ancient door jams into the foundations of houses \nand community buildings. They learn about the people who lived\nthere by observing what they left behind. Natural geological events,\nsuch as earthquakes and tsunamis, will continue to shape our continents, just as they have for millions of years. As increased global warming melts\nour polar ice caps at accelerated rates and sea levels rise, we will be forced to adapt, like Pavlopetri's inhabitants. Undoubtedly, over the coming centuries, some of the coastal areas \nthat we live in today will eventually be claimed \nby the water, too - cities like Venice, New Orleans, Amsterdam, Miami, and Tokyo. Imagine what future civilizations\nwill learn about us as they swim around the ancient ruins\nof the cities that we live in today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Isostatic sea level change affects:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Localized areas."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The entire ocean."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Heavy buildings."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The oldest cities."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of these famous sunken cities is fictional?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Alexandria"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Port Royal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pavlopetri"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Atlantis"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "One reason that cities are built by the sea is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It offers a firmer foundation than inland settlements"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are in close proximity to trade and food sources"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are cheaper places to settle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They offer a view"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which natural phenomena can contribute to sinking a city?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Liquefaction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Earthquakes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sea level change"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tsunami"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "How many years ago did the last Ice Age end and release the weight of the ice caps from the Earth’s crust?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1.5 million"}, {"label": "B", "text": "19,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "25"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Isostatic sea level change affects:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Localized areas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The entire ocean"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Heavy buildings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The oldest cities"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 37, "lesson": 18, "title": "Your words may predict your future mental health", "category": "Linguistics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/OHNvndRL", "transcript": {"en": "We have historical records that allow us\nto know how the ancient Greeks dressed, how they lived, how they fought ... but how did they think? One natural idea is that the deepest\naspects of human thought -- our ability to imagine, to be conscious, to dream -- have always been the same. Another possibility is that the social transformations\nthat have shaped our culture may have also changed\nthe structural columns of human thought. We may all have different\nopinions about this. Actually, it's a long-standing\nphilosophical debate. But is this question\neven amenable to science? Here I'd like to propose that in the same way we can reconstruct\nhow the ancient Greek cities looked just based on a few bricks, that the writings of a culture\nare the archaeological records, the fossils, of human thought. And in fact, doing some form of psychological analysis of some of the most ancient\nbooks of human culture, Julian Jaynes came up in the '70s\nwith a very wild and radical hypothesis: that only 3,000 years ago, humans were what today\nwe would call schizophrenics. And he made this claim based on the fact that the first\nhumans described in these books behaved consistently, in different traditions\nand in different places of the world, as if they were hearing and obeying voices that they perceived\nas coming from the Gods, or from the muses ... what today we would call hallucinations. And only then, as time went on, they began to recognize\nthat they were the creators, the owners of these inner voices. And with this, they gained introspection: the ability to think\nabout their own thoughts. So Jaynes's theory is that consciousness, at least in the way we perceive it today, where we feel that we are the pilots\nof our own existence -- is a quite recent cultural development. And this theory is quite spectacular, but it has an obvious problem which is that it's built on just a few\nand very specific examples. So the question is whether the theory that introspection built up in human\nhistory only about 3,000 years ago can be examined in a quantitative\nand objective manner. And the problem of how\nto go about this is quite obvious. It's not like Plato woke up one day\nand then he wrote, \"Hello, I'm Plato, and as of today, I have\na fully introspective consciousness.\" (Laughter) And this tells us actually\nwhat is the essence of the problem. We need to find the emergence\nof a concept that's never said. The word introspection\ndoes not appear a single time in the books we want to analyze. So our way to solve this\nis to build the space of words. This is a huge space\nthat contains all words in such a way that the distance\nbetween any two of them is indicative of how\nclosely related they are. So for instance, you want the words \"dog\" and \"cat\"\nto be very close together, but the words \"grapefruit\" and \"logarithm\"\nto be very far away. And this has to be true\nfor any two words within the space. And there are different ways\nthat we can construct the space of words. One is just asking the experts, a bit like we do with dictionaries. Another possibility is following the simple assumption\nthat when two words are related, they tend to appear in the same sentences, in the same paragraphs, in the same documents, more often than would be expected\njust by pure chance. And this simple hypothesis, this simple method, with some computational tricks that have to do with the fact that this is a very complex\nand high-dimensional space, turns out to be quite effective. And just to give you a flavor\nof how well this works, this is the result we get when\nwe analyze this for some familiar words. And you can see first that words automatically organize\ninto semantic neighborhoods. So you get the fruits, the body parts, the computer parts,\nthe scientific terms and so on. The algorithm also identifies\nthat we organize concepts in a hierarchy. So for instance, you can see that the scientific terms\nbreak down into two subcategories of the astronomic and the physics terms. And then there are very fine things. For instance, the word astronomy, which seems a bit bizarre where it is, is actually exactly where it should be, between what it is, an actual science, and between what it describes, the astronomical terms. And we could go on and on with this. Actually, if you stare\nat this for a while, and you just build random trajectories, you will see that it actually feels\na bit like doing poetry. And this is because, in a way, walking in this space\nis like walking in the mind. And the last thing is that this algorithm also identifies\nwhat are our intuitions, of which words should lead\nin the neighborhood of introspection. So for instance, words such as \"self,\" \"guilt,\"\n\"reason,\" \"emotion,\" are very close to \"introspection,\" but other words, such as \"red,\" \"football,\"\n\"candle,\" \"banana,\" are just very far away. And so once we've built the space, the question of the history\nof introspection, or of the history of any concept which before could seem abstract\nand somehow vague, becomes concrete -- becomes amenable to quantitative science. All that we have to do is take the books, we digitize them, and we take this stream\nof words as a trajectory and project them into the space, and then we ask whether this trajectory\nspends significant time circling closely to the concept\nof introspection. And with this, we could analyze\nthe history of introspection in the ancient Greek tradition, for which we have the best\navailable written record. So what we did is we took all the books -- we just ordered them by time -- for each book we take the words and we project them to the space, and then we ask for each word\nhow close it is to introspection, and we just average that. And then we ask whether,\nas time goes on and on, these books get closer,\nand closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And this is exactly what happens\nin the ancient Greek tradition. So you can see that for the oldest books\nin the Homeric tradition, there is a small increase with books\ngetting closer to introspection. But about four centuries before Christ, this starts ramping up very rapidly\nto an almost five-fold increase of books getting closer,\nand closer and closer to the concept of introspection. And one of the nice things about this is that now we can ask whether this is also true\nin a different, independent tradition. So we just ran this same analysis\non the Judeo-Christian tradition, and we got virtually the same pattern. Again, you see a small increase\nfor the oldest books in the Old Testament, and then it increases much more rapidly in the new books of the New Testament. And then we get the peak of introspection in \"The Confessions of Saint Augustine,\" about four centuries after Christ. And this was very important, because Saint Augustine\nhad been recognized by scholars, philologists, historians, as one of the founders of introspection. Actually, some believe him to be\nthe father of modern psychology. So our algorithm, which has the virtue\nof being quantitative, of being objective, and of course of being extremely fast -- it just runs in a fraction of a second -- can capture some of the most\nimportant conclusions of this long tradition of investigation. And this is in a way\none of the beauties of science, which is that now this idea\ncan be translated and generalized to a whole lot\nof different domains. So in the same way that we asked\nabout the past of human consciousness, maybe the most challenging question\nwe can pose to ourselves is whether this can tell us something\nabout the future of our own consciousness. To put it more precisely, whether the words we say today can tell us something\nof where our minds will be in a few days, in a few months or a few years from now. And in the same way many of us\nare now wearing sensors that detect our heart rate, our respiration, our genes, on the hopes that this may\nhelp us prevent diseases, we can ask whether monitoring\nand analyzing the words we speak, we tweet, we email, we write, can tell us ahead of time whether\nsomething may go wrong with our minds. And with Guillermo Cecchi, who has been my brother in this adventure, we took on this task. And we did so by analyzing\nthe recorded speech of 34 young people who were at a high risk\nof developing schizophrenia. And so what we did is,\nwe measured speech at day one, and then we asked whether the properties\nof the speech could predict, within a window of almost three years, the future development of psychosis. But despite our hopes, we got failure after failure. There was just not enough\ninformation in semantics to predict the future\norganization of the mind. It was good enough to distinguish between a group\nof schizophrenics and a control group, a bit like we had done\nfor the ancient texts, but not to predict the future\nonset of psychosis. But then we realized that maybe the most important thing\nwas not so much what they were saying, but how they were saying it. More specifically, it was not in which semantic\nneighborhoods the words were, but how far and fast they jumped from one semantic neighborhood\nto the other one. And so we came up with this measure, which we termed semantic coherence, which essentially measures the persistence\nof speech within one semantic topic, within one semantic category. And it turned out to be\nthat for this group of 34 people, the algorithm based on semantic\ncoherence could predict, with 100 percent accuracy, who developed psychosis and who will not. And this was something\nthat could not be achieved -- not even close -- with all the other\nexisting clinical measures. And I remember vividly,\nwhile I was working on this, I was sitting at my computer and I saw a bunch of tweets by Polo -- Polo had been my first student\nback in Buenos Aires, and at the time\nhe was living in New York. And there was something in this tweets -- I could not tell exactly what\nbecause nothing was said explicitly -- but I got this strong hunch, this strong intuition,\nthat something was going wrong. So I picked up the phone,\nand I called Polo, and in fact he was not feeling well. And this simple fact, that reading in between the lines, I could sense,\nthrough words, his feelings, was a simple, but very\neffective way to help. What I tell you today is that we're getting\nclose to understanding how we can convert this intuition\nthat we all have, that we all share, into an algorithm. And in doing so, we may be seeing in the future\na very different form of mental health, based on objective, quantitative\nand automated analysis of the words we write, of the words we say. Gracias.

{"page": 37, "lesson": 19, "title": "Why do we kiss?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/xBNXhZgh", "transcript": {"en": "On valentine's day 2013, a Thai couple broke\nthe world record for longest kiss, when they sucked face for over 58 hours. 58 hours! Wo-how?! You could drive across the entire United States\nin less time! These lovebirds couldn't even sit down that\nwhole time, and had to pee while kissing. The logistics of which I don't want to think\nabout. Still, got me thinking, when the first two\nhumans brushed lips, could they ever have imagined it would end with chapped lips and\na cash prize, and where did kissing get it's start anyway? The earliest reference to kissing is out of\na Sanskrit text from India, dating back to 1500 BC. Now that doesn't mean that folks weren't snogging\nbefore then, that's just the first record we have. Some believe that Alexander the Great's army\nspread kissing from India to the Middle East. From there, it caught on in Ancient Greece\nand Rome, perhaps more as a display of deference than romance. Slaves kissed the hands of their masters as\na sign of submission. Men of standing kissed each other on the cheek\nin greeting, and even today it's important to note that there are lots of different types\nof, and reasons for, kissing, from ritual to friendship to comfort to passion. To a Guinness book title, apparently. By the middle ages, people all over Europe\nwere swapping spit, and by the 19th century we actually gave the study of kissing the\ndecidedly un-sexy title of Philematology. Rrrr. So, why do we kiss? Well, there are two theories about it's origins,\none maintains that it's instinctual, the other believes that its a learned behavior. Folks in the instinctual camp point out that\nBonobos and some other animals seem to display kissing type behavior as an expression of\ncomfort, expression and bonding, but critics of this theory like to point out that ten\npercent of human cultures don't even kiss, or at least haven't until fairly recently. Various tribes in Africa and some Australian\nAborigines and Tahitians are among groups that don't seem to kiss, they probably just\nthink that we're super weird. So some believe that kissing is a learned\nbehavior that evolved from regurgitation. Oh yeah. Hot stuff. No, I do not mean barfing. I mean mothers chewing solid food and feeding\nit to their babies, mouth to mouth, like birds, wolves and lots of other animals do. This type of feeding not only helped pre-digest\nfood, but also established bonding and intimacy. And it isn't really a stretch to picture it\nshifting to kisses as a sign of affection. From there, presumably, people just realized\nthat sucking face felt like all good and tingly, which is a compelling reason to do a lot of\nthings. Our lips and tongues are jam-packed with sensitive\nnerve endings that light up our brains pleasure receptors like a Coney Island rollercoaster. If it's a really good, passionate kiss, our\ncheeks flush as blood vessels expand, our pupils dilate, we get all dreamy eyed, and\nour heart rates increase, pumping more oxygen into the brain. Suddenly, we're riding a wave of feel-good\nhormones like dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and adrenaline. That is the chemical cocktail that makes you\nfeel like a family of bees just moved into your belly. Interesting, a males testosterone can pass\ninto a females mouth from kissing, making her more receptive to sex, baby-making, and\nthe passing along of genes, which is, of course, evolution's ultimate goal. And smooching doesn't just feel good to most\npeople, it's also good for you, in several different ways. It burns calories of course, reduces stress\nand it might just help you select the right kind of mate. Gettin' all up in someone's grill gives you\ngreat access to a nose full of pheromones, those subtle chemical signals that allow us\nto sniff out optimal mates. And as we explained in a previous episode\nabout sex appeal, people tend to be attracted to mates with different immune system make-up\nthan their own, and swapping spit is a great way to get a snoot full of pheromones to see\nif your potential mate is a good fit. All that history and biology aside, kissing\nis probably one of those things that its best not to really over-think. Personally, I'd rather just remember that\nnervous, sweaty magic of my first kiss than picture a mouthful of pre-chewed meat coming\nat me.

{"page": 37, "lesson": 20, "title": "Which sunscreen should you choose? - Mary Poffenroth", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/which-sunscreen-should-you-choose-mary-poffenroth", "transcript": {"en": "Sunscreen comes in many forms, each with its own impacts on your body\nand the environment. With so many options, how do you choose which sunscreen\nis best for you? To answer that question, we first have to understand\nhow sunscreens work. Sunlight is composed\nof electromagnetic waves and is our primary source\nof ultraviolet radiation, which has a shorter wavelength than\nvisible light and carries more energy. UVA, UVB, and UVC are classified according\nto their wavelengths. Short wavelength UVC\nnever reaches the Earth's surface, but UVB and UVA do. Medium wavelength UVB rays\ncan enter the skin's superficial layers and long length UVA rays\ncan penetrate into the deeper layers. UVB in small amounts actually helps\nus make vitamin D, which enables our bodies to build\nand maintain strong bones. However, prolonged exposure to UVA\nand UVB can damage DNA, age your skin, and promote the development\nof potentially deadly skin cancer. Sunscreen protects your skin\neither physically by deflecting UV rays with an inorganic blocker \nlike zinc oxide or titanium dioxide, or chemically by using carbon-based\ncompounds to absorb UV photons that are then harmlessly \ndissipated as heat. So, what differentiates one sunscreen\nfrom another? When we choose a sunscreen, we can compare application method, the SPF, and the active ingredients. Sprays can be convenient to put on,\nespecially when you're wet, but a recent study found that most people\ndon't apply a thick enough layer to get full protection. And the possible health risks of inhaling \nsunscreen compounds from a spray cloud might make you consider reaching\nfor that bottle of lotion instead. Opt for a sunscreen with an SPF\nof at least 15, although 30 is better. SPF is a nonlinear scale of how much\nUVB radiation is needed to give protected skin a sunburn. SPF 15 does a pretty good job by blocking\n93% of UVB rays. You get a slight increase as SPF goes up, with SPF 30 blocking 97%, and 50 blocking 98%. SPF is based on the quantity\nof solar exposure. So how much time you have before\nyou start to burn really depends on a long list of factors, including your genetics, and when, where, and how\nyou spend your time in the sun. Even though US marketed sunscreens\nhave been deemed safe by the FDA, scientists are still researching\nthe effects of many active ingredients on the human body. So if you're worried \nabout potential irritants, look for mineral-based formulas\nwith zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. Even though they may go on \na bit thick at first, they're less irritating than carbon-based\nchemical sunscreens. These mineral-based sunscreens\nare preferential for the environment, too. If you plan on catching rays\nwhile splashing in a river or the ocean, keep in mind that carbon-based\nchemical sunscreens can harm marine life. Take coral reefs, for example. Although they cover less than 1%\nof the Earth's underwater surface, they're home to nearly 25% of all\nfish species, making them the most diverse\nand productive marine ecosystems. Research shows that carbon-based\nchemical sunscreen ingredients, like oxybenzone, butylparaben, \noctinoxate, and 4MBC contribute to a stress condition called\ncoral bleaching in corals, which are living creatures. Exposure to these organic compounds results in the death \nof the coral's symbiotic algae. In addition to providing \na reliable food source, these algae give coral their brilliant\nrainbow of colors. Without them, corals turn a bleached white and are susceptible to disease\nand possibly death. And once the coral dies, the entire reef ecosystem \nis not far behind. So you're now ready to make an informed\nchoice when picking out your next sunscreen. SPF is clearly labeled on the front. On the back under \"active ingredients,\" you can find whether zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and those coral-harming components\nare present. Taking a bit more time to check\ncan be well worth it for both you and the environment."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Ultraviolet radiation comes in which of these forms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "UVA"}, {"label": "B", "text": "UVB"}, {"label": "C", "text": "UVC"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Vitamin D is essential for good health.

So now I'd like you to imagine\nplaying a very different role. That of the scout. So the scout's job\nis not to attack or defend. The scout's job is to understand. The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain,\nidentifying potential obstacles, and the scout may hope to learn\nthat say, there's a bridge in a convenient location across the river. But above all, the scout\nwants to know what's really there as accurately as possible. And in a real actual army, both the soldier\nand the scout are essential. But you can also think of each\nof these roles as a mindset. A metaphor for how\nall of us process information and ideas in our daily lives. And what I'm going to argue today\nis that having good judgment, and making accurate predictions,\nmaking good decisions is mostly about which mindset you're in. So, to illustrate\nthese mindsets in action, I'm going to take you back\nto 19th century France where this innocuous looking\npiece of paper launched one of the biggest political scandals\nin history. It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French general staff. And it was torn up in a wastepaper basket but when they pieced it back together,\nthey discovered that someone in their ranks\nhad been selling military secrets to Germany. So they launched a big investigation and their suspicions quickly converged on this man, Alfred Dreyfus. He had a sterling record. No past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far as they could tell. But Dreyfus was the only Jewish\nofficer at that rank in the Army and unfortunately, at this time, the French army was highly anti-semitic. So they compared Dreyfus's\nhandwriting to that on the memo and included that it was a match. Even though outside\nprofessional handwriting experts were much less confident\nin the similarity, but never mind that. They went and searched Dreyfus's apartment looking for any signs of espionage. They went through his files\nand they didn't find anything. And this just convinced them more\nthat Dreyfus was not only guilty, but sneaky as well, because clearly\nhe had hidden all of the evidence before they had managed to get to it. Next, they went and looked\nthrough his personal history for any incriminating details. They talked to his teachers. They found that he had studied\nforeign languages in school which clearly showed a desire to conspire\nwith foreign governments later in life. His teachers also said\nthat Dreyfus had a good memory and was known\nfor having a good memory. Which was highly suspicious, right? You know, because a spy\nhas to remember a lot of things. So, the case went to trial\nand Dreyfus was found guilty. And afterwards they took him\nout into this public square and ritualistically tore\nhis insignia for his uniform and broke his sword and two. This is called the degradation of Dreyfus. And they sentenced him\nto life imprisonment on the aptly named Devil's Island which is this barren rock\noff the coast of South America. So there he went. And there he spent\nhis days alone writing letters and letters to the French government begging them to reopen his case\nso they could discover his innocence. But for the most part,\nFrance considered the matter closed. So one thing that's\nreally interesting to me about the Dreyfus Affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. I mean you might even assume\nthat they were setting him up. They were intentionally framing him, but historians don't think\nthat's what happened. As far as we can tell,\nthe officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong. Which you know,\nmakes you wonder what does it say about the human mind\nthat we can find such paltry evidence to be compelling enough to convict a man? Well, this is a case\nof what scientists call \"motivated reasoning\". It's this phenomenon which\nour unconscious motivations, our desires and fears shape\nthe way we interpret information. So some information,\nsome ideas feel like our allies and we want them to win. We want to defend them. And other information\nor ideas are the enemy and we want to shoot them down. So this is why I call\nmotivated reasoning, \"soldier mindset.\" And probably most of you\nhave never persecuted a French Jewish officer for high treason\nI assume, but maybe you've followed\nsports or politics. So you might have noticed\nthat when the referee judges that your team committed\na foul for example, you're highly motivated\nto find reasons why he's wrong. But if he judges that the other\nteam committed a foul - awesome! That's a good call. Let's not examine it too closely. Or, maybe you've read an article or study that examined some controversial policy like capital punishment. And as researchers have demonstrated, if you support capital punishment, and the study shows\nthat is not effective, then you're highly motivated\nto find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed. But if it shows\nthat capital punishment works - awesome! It's a good study. And vice versa. If you don't support capital punishment,\nsame thing. Our judgment is just strongly\ninfluenced unconsciously by which side we want to win. And this is ubiquitous. This shapes how we think\nabout our health, relationships, how we decide how to vote,\nwhat we consider fair or ethical, and what's most scary to me\nabout motivated reasoning or soldier mindset,\nis how unconscious it is. We can think we're being\nobjective and fair-minded and still wind up ruining\nthe life of an innocent man. However, fortunately for Dreyfus,\nhis story is not over. This is Colonel Picquart. He is another high-ranking officer\nin the French army, and like most people,\nhe assumed Dreyfus was guilty. Also like most people in the Army, he was at least casually anti-Semitic. But at a certain point,\nPicquart began to suspect what if we are all wrong about Dreyfus? And what happened was,\nhe had discovered evidence that the spying for Germany had continued even after Dreyfus was in prison. And he had also discovered\nthat another officer in the Army had handwriting that perfectly\nmatched the memo. Much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting. So he brought these discoveries\nto his superiors but to his dismay,\nthey either didn't care, or came up with elaborate rationalizations\nto explain his findings, like, \"Well, all you've really shown,\nPiquart, is that there is another spy who learned how to mimic\nDreyfus's handwriting, and he picked up the torch\nof spying after Dreyfus left. But Dreyfus is still guilty. Eventually, Piquart managed\nto get Dreyfus exonerated. But it took him 10 years, and for part of that time,\nhe himself was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the Army. So, you know, a lot of people feel like Piquart can't really\nbe the hero of this story. Because he was\nan anti-Semite and that's bad. Which I agree with,\nbut personally, for me, the fact that Piquant was anti-Semitic actually makes his actions\nmore admirable to me. Because he had the same\nprejudices, the same reasons to be biased as his fellow officers, but his motivation to find the truth\nand uphold it just trumped all of that. So to me, Piquart is a poster child\nfor what I call \"scout mindset.\" It's the drive not to make\none idea win or another lose, but just to see what's really there\nas honestly and accurately as you can, even if it's not pretty\nor convenient or pleasant. And this mindset\nis what I'm personally passionate about. And what I've spent\nthe last few years examining and trying to figure out\nwhat causes scout mindset. You know, why are some people\nsometimes at least, able to cut through their own prejudices\nand biases and motivations and just to see the facts and evidence as objectively as they can? And the answer is emotional. So, just as the soldier mindset\nis rooted in emotions like defensiveness or tribalism,\nscout mindset is too. It's just rooted in different emotions. So for example, scouts are curious. They're more likely to say\nthat they feel pleasure when they learn new information\nor an itch to solve a puzzle. They're more likely to feel intrigued when they encounter something\nthat contradicts or expectations. Scouts also have different values. They are more likely to say\nthat they think it's virtuous to test your own beliefs\nand they're less likely to say that someone\nwho changes his mind seems weak. And above all, scouts are grounded. Which means that their self-worth as a person isn't tied\nto how right or wrong they are about any particular topic. So, you know, they can believe\nthat capital punishment works and if studies come out showing\nthat it doesn't, they can say, \"Huh. Looks like I might be wrong. Doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid.\" So these traits, this cluster of traits is what researchers have found - and I've also found anecdotally -\npredicts good judgment. And the key takeaway\nI want to leave you with about those traits\nis that they're primarily not about how smart you are,\nor about how much you know. In fact they don't correlate\nvery much with IQ at all. They're about how you feel. So, there's a quote that I keep\ncoming back to by Saint-Exupery. He is the author of \"The Little Prince.\" And he said, \"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men\nto collect wood and give orders and distribute the work. Instead, teach them to yearn\nfor the vast and endless sea.\" In other words, I claim if we want to really improve our judgment\nas individuals and as societies, what we need most is not more\ninstruction in logic or rhetoric or probability or economics, even though those things\nare quite valuable. But what we most need to use those principles well,\nis scout mindset. We need to change the way we feel. We need to learn how to feel\nproud instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been\nwrong about something. We need to learn how to feel\nintrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts our beliefs. So, the question I want to leave you with, is what do you most yearn for? Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs, or do you yearn to see the world\nas clearly as you possibly can? Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

He wasn't cured until 68 years later and is now listed by Guinness as\nthe world record holder for hiccup longevity. Meanwhile, Florida teen Jennifer Mee may hold the record \nfor the most frequent hiccups, 50 times per minute \nfor more than four weeks in 2007. So what causes hiccups? Doctors point out that a round\nof hiccups often follows from stimuli that stretch the stomach, like swallowing air or too rapid eating or drinking. Others associate hiccups \nwith intense emotions or a response to them: laughing, sobbing, anxiety, and excitement. Let's look at what happens when we hiccup. It begins with an involuntary spasm\nor sudden contraction of the diaphragm, the large dome-shaped muscle\nbelow our lungs that we use to inhale air. This is followed almost immediately\nby the sudden closure of the vocal chords and the opening between them, which is called the glottis. The movement of the diaphragm\ninitiates a sudden intake of air, but the closure of the vocal chords\nstops it from entering the wind pipe and reaching the lungs. It also creates the characteristic sound:\n\"hic.\" To date, there is no known function\nfor hiccups. They don't seem to provide any medical\nor physiological advantage. Why begin to inhale air only to suddenly\nstop it from actually entering the lungs? Anatomical structures, or physiological mechanisms, \nwith no apparent purpose present challenges \nto evolutionary biologists. Do such structures serve some hidden\nfunction that hasn't yet been discovered? Or are they relics \nof our evolutionary past, having once served some important purpose only to persist into the present \nas vestigial remnants? One idea is that hiccups began many millions of years\nbefore the appearance of humans. The lung is thought to have evolved\nas a structure to allow early fish, many of which lived in warm, stagnant\nwater with little oxygen, to take advantage of the abundant oxygen\nin the air overhead. When descendants of these animals\nlater moved onto land, they moved from gill-based ventilation\nto air-breathing with lungs. That's similar to the much more rapid\nchanges faced by frogs today as they transition \nfrom tadpoles with gills to adults with lungs. This hypothesis suggests that the hiccup\nis a relic of the ancient transition from water to land. An inhalation that could \nmove water over gills followed by a rapid closure of the glottis\npreventing water from entering the lungs. That's supported by evidence which suggests that the neural patterning\ninvolved in generating a hiccup is almost identical to that responsible\nfor respiration in amphibians. Another group of scientists believe\nthat the reflex is retained in us today because it actually provides\nan important advantage. They point out that true hiccups\nare found only in mammals and that they're not retained in birds,\nlizards, turtles, or any other exclusively \nair-breathing animals. Further, hiccups appear in human babies\nlong before birth and are far more common in infants\nthat adults. Their explanation for this involves the uniquely mammalian \nactivity of nursing. The ancient hiccup reflex may have been\nadapted by mammals to help remove air from the stomach\nas a sort of glorified burp. The sudden expansion of the diaphragm\nwould raise air from the stomach, while a closure of the glottis would\nprevent milk from entering the lungs. Sometimes, a bout of hiccups will go\non and on, and we try home remedies: sipping continuously \nfrom a glass of cold water, holding one's breath, a mouthful of honey or peanut butter, breathing into a paper bag, or being suddenly frightened. Unfortunately, scientists have yet\nto verify that any one cure works better or more consistently\nthan others. However, we do know one thing\nthat definitely doesn't work."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Hiccups are most common in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Babies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Children over five years of age"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Young adults"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The elderly"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The principal function of the diaphragm is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Inhalation - to help draw air into the lungs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exhalation - to help move air out of the lungs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To help move air out of the stomach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To help decrease the volume of the chest cavity and lungs"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Hiccups are most common in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Babies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Children over five years of age"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Young adults"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The elderly"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Among vertebrate animals that breathe air, which experience hiccups?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Birds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Turtles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alligators"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The closure of the vocal cords (and glottis) during a human hiccup prevents:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water from entering the lungs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Air from entering the stomach"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Air from entering the windpipe (or trachea)"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Water from entering the stomach"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "One possible function for hiccups in mammals is to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ensure that air moves properly into the windpipe while nursing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Help move air from the stomach while nursing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Help move air from the lungs while nursing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ensure the movement of air into the lungs while nursing"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

And it was found close to here, Stanford. Psychology professor took kids that were four years old and put them in a room all by themselves. And he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid, \"Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow for 15 minutes. If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here, you will get another one. So you will have two.\" To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes for something that they like, is equivalent to telling us, \"We'll bring you coffee in two hours.\" (Laughter) Exact equivalent. So what happened when the professor left the room? As soon as the door closed... two out of three ate the marshmallow. Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes. Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes. (Laughter) Couldn't do it. Could not wait. What's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go like this ... Would look at it. Put it back. They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants. That child already, at four, understood the most important principle for success, which is the ability to delay gratification. Self-discipline: the most important factor for success. 15 years later, 14 or 15 years later, follow-up study. What did they find? They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19. And they found that 100 percent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful. They had good grades. They were doing wonderful. They were happy. They had their plans. They had good relationships with the teachers, students. They were doing fine. A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow, they were in trouble. They did not make it to university. They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out. A few were still there with bad grades. A few had good grades. I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids react the same way as the American kids? So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment. And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids. And let me show you what happened. (Spanish) (Laughter) So what happened in Colombia? Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow; one out of three did not. This little girl was interesting; she ate the inside of the marshmallow. (Laughter) In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two. But she ate it. So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her. (Laughter) She should not go into banking, for example, or work at a cash register. But she will be successful. And this applies for everything. Even in sales. The sales person that -- the customer says, \"I want that.\" And the person says, \"Okay, here you are.\" That person ate the marshmallow. If the sales person says, \"Wait a second. Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice.\" Then you sell a lot more. So this has applications in all walks of life. I end with -- the Koreans did this. You know what? This is so good that we want a marshmallow book for children. We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea. They are teaching these kids exactly this principle. And we need to learn that principle here in the States, because we have a big debt. We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.

{"page": 37, "lesson": 24, "title": "Why the metric system matters - Matt Anticole", "category": "Measurement", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-the-metric-system-matters-matt-anticole", "transcript": {"en": "What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally\ncrashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars? Actually, everything. That crash happened due to an error in converting between \ntwo measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence. So what's the connection to\nthe French Revolution? Let's explain. For the majority of recorded \nhuman history, units like the weight of a grain\nor the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place. And different regions didn't just use\nvarying measurements. They had completely different \nnumber systems as well. By the late Middle Ages,\nthe Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals \nand fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins\nto promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful. With a quarter million different units\nin France alone, any widespread change would require\nmassive disruption. And in 1789, that disruption came. The leaders of the French Revolution\ndidn't just overthrow the monarchy. They sought to completely \ntransform society according to the rational principles\nof the Enlightenment. When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened\nto reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority\nor local traditions were replaced with mathematical\nand natural relationships. For example, the meter,\nfrom the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000\nbetween the Equator and North Pole. And the new metric system was,\nin the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, \"For all people, for all time.\" Standardizing measurements\nhad political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well. Nobles could no longer manipulate local\nunits to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect\ntaxes more efficiently. And switching to a new Republican Calendar\nwith ten-day weeks reduced church power \nby eliminating Sundays. Adoption of this new system wasn't easy. In fact, it was a bit of a mess. At first, people used new units\nalongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar \nwas eventually abandoned. When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses \nto use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. But the metric system remained standard\nfor formal use, and it spread across the continent,\nalong with France's borders. While Napoléon's empire \nlasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer. Some European countries reverted\nto old measurements upon independence. Others realized the value \nof standardization in an age of international trade. After Portugal and the Netherlands\nswitched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system\naround the world. As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas\nand retained its traditional units. But over the next two centuries,\nthe British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system\nas an optional alternative before gradually making it offical. However, this switch came too late\nfor thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence. The United States of America stuck with\nthe English units of its colonial past and today remains one \nof only three countries which haven't fully embraced \nthe metric system. Despite constant initiatives \nfor metrication, many Americans consider units like feet\nand pounds more intuitive. And ironically, some regard the once\nrevolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity. Nevertheless, the metric system is almost\nuniversally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according\nto its original principles. For a long time, standard units were actually defined by \ncarefully maintained physical prototypes. But thanks to improving technology\nand precision, these objects with limited access\nand unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards\nbased on universal constants, like the speed of light. Consistent measurements are such\nan integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major\naccomplishment for humanity they've been. And just as it arose \nfrom a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial\nfor the scientific revolutions to come."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who was the earliest advocate for a uniform measuring system?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Marquis de Concordet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Napoleon Bonaparte"}, {"label": "C", "text": "John Wilkins"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ernest Rutherford"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What historical event was pivotal in the adoption of a unified measurement system?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The 1918 Flu Epidemic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The French Revolution"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The 1846 Potato Famine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "World War I"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What defines our current ‘standard’ for one meter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The length of a pendulum arm that takes 1 second to swing from left to right"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The distance equal to 1/10,000,000 the distance between the Equator and North Pole"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The distance light travels in a tiny fraction of a second"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The distance a 1 kilogram object travels in one second when acted on by a force of 1 newton"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The word meter derives from a Greek word that means:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Global"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stride"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hearth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Measure"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT an advantage of the metric system?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It helps to streamline trade between different countries"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It has been officially adopted by every country around the globe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It provides a common language to discuss scientific data"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is based on measurements from the world itself and not arbitrary standards"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
