This feathered dinosaur bridged the evolutionary\ngap between older ancestors like the T-Rex, and modern day birds. Anzu wylei is similar to a velociraptor in\nsize, but, like a bird, it made nests and sat on its eggs until they hatched, and also\nhad hollow bones and a parrot-like short beak. This coral-like tuber plant -- scientifically\nnamed Balanophora coralliformis -- is a parasite (meaning it eats other plants instead of getting\nits energy from photosynthesis). It’s found in the Mt. Mingan region of the Philippines. Cebrennus rechenbergi is a spider that uses\nan energy-conserving cartwheel technique to propel itself toward threats. In the deserts of Morocco, where it lives,\na lack of places to hide and high temperatures makes running away a bad option. This tiny sea creature looks like a plant,\nbut the Dendrogramma enigmatica is actually a multicellular animal with a mouth at the\nend of its “stem.” It seems to be related to jellyfish or anemones,\nbut it’s also evolutionarily different enough that it could be a whole new phylum. What makes the Deuteragenia ossarium special\nis brilliant engineering. It lays its eggs one each in separate cells\nformed in hollow stems. Not only does it kill a spider and drop it\nin each cell as nourishment for her young, but she completely walls off the end of the\nstem with the bodies of dead ants, creating a chemical barrier that hides the fact that\nit’s the front door to her precious nest. This little frog in Indonesia is one of a\nkind. Of the more than 6,400 species of frogs on\nour planet, the Limnonectes larvaepartus is the only one that gives birth to live tadpoles. Phryganistria tamdaoensis gets its name from\nthe beautiful Tam Dao National Park in northwestern Vietnam, where this giant stick insect had\ngone undiscovered until now. This sheds light on just how we’ve left\nto go. Of the 12 million total estimated species\nthat exist in the world, we have discovered and named just 2 million, or 16%. This new species of sea slug is a beauty of\nthe deep living in the waters off the coast of Japan. The Phyllodesmium acanthorhinum appears to\nglow blue, red and gold when photographed. With its rose colored spikes, the Tillandsia\nreligiosa has long been used to decorate elaborate nativity scenes in remote parts of Mexico,\nbut scientifically it had gone undiscovered, until now. The bromeliad grows on cliffs at altitudes\nbetween 6,000 and 7,000 feet. For 20 years the cause of these geometric\ndesigns on the seafloor was a mystery, until their designer was discovered, a subspecies\nof Pufferfish called Torquigener albomaculosus. What looks like an underwater crop circle\nis actually a nest that minimizes ocean current to protect eggs buried in the center. Thanks for watching.

He had wrapped cardboard around the tube to keep the fluorescent \nlight from escaping, when something peculiar happened. Another screen outside the tube\nwas glowing. In other words, invisible rays\nhad passed through the cardboard. Wilhelm had no idea what those rays were,\nso he called them X-rays, and his discovery eventually won him\na Nobel Prize. Here's what we now know was happening. When high energy electrons\nin the cathode tube hit a metal component, they either got slowed down\nand released extra energy, or kicked off electrons\nfrom the atoms they hit, which triggered a reshuffling\nthat again released energy. In both cases, the energy was emitted\nin the form of X-rays, which is a type \nof electromagnetic radiation with higher energy than visible light,\nand lower energy than Gamma rays. X-rays are powerful enough\nto fly through many kinds of matter as if they are semi-transparent, and they're particularly useful \nfor medical applications because they can make images of organs,\nlike bones, without harming them, although they do have a small chance of causing mutations \nin reproductive organs, and tissues like the thyroid, which is why lead aprons are often\nused to block them. When X-rays interact with matter,\nthey collide with electrons. Sometimes, the X-ray transfers all of its\nenergy to the matter and gets absorbed. Other times, it only transfers \nsome of its energy, and the rest is scattered. The frequency of these outcomes depends on how many electrons\nthe X-rays are likely to hit. Collisions are more likely \nif a material is dense, or if it's made of elements\nwith higher atomic numbers, which means more electrons. Bones are dense and full of calcium,\nwhich has a relatively high atomic number, so they absorb X-rays pretty well. Soft tissue, on the other hand,\nisn't as dense, and contains mostly lower \natomic number elements, like carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. So more of the X-rays penetrate tissues\nlike lungs and muscles, darkening the film. These 2-D pictures are only useful\nup to a point, though. When X-rays travel through the body, they can interact with many atoms \nalong the path. What is recorded on the film reflects\nthe sum of all those interactions. It's like trying to print 100 pages\nof a novel on a single sheet of paper. To see what's really going on, you would have to take X-ray views\nfrom many angles around the body and use them to construct\nan internal image. And that's something \ndoctors do all the time in a procedure called a CT,\nComputed Tomography scan, another Nobel Prize winning invention. Think of CT like this. With just one X-ray, you might be able to see the density\nchange due to a solid tumor in a patient, but you wouldn't know how deep\nit is beneath the surface. However, if you take X-rays\nfrom multiple angles, you should be able to find\nthe tumor's position and shape. A CT scanner works by sending\na fan or cone of X-rays through a patient to an array of detectors. The X-ray beam is rotated \naround the patient, and often also moved down \nthe patient's body, with the X-ray source tracing\na spiral trajectory. Spiral CT scans produce data\nthat can be processed into cross sections detailed enough to spot \nanatomical features, tumors, blood clots, and infections. CT scans can even detect \nheart disease and cavities in mummies buried thousands of years ago. So what began as Roentgen's happy accident\nhas become a medical marvel. Hospitals and clinics now conduct over\n100 millions scans each year worldwide to treat diseases and save lives."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "X-rays were discovered by _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mathematical derivation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Experimental accident"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Technical innovation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Philosophical reasoning"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Many visually opaque objects become _____ under X-ray illumination.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Totally transparent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Absolutely opaque"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Semi-transparent"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chemically active"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "X-ray scattering happens due to _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Interaction between X-ray photons and material"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Force between X-ray photons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Decay within material under radiation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Field inside the X-ray tube"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A cross-section through which a patient can be reconstructed from _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One projection"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two projections"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Three projections"}, {"label": "D", "text": "As many projections as necessary"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Modern CT data are often collected when the x-ray source moves along _____ around the patient.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A straight line"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A polygon"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An ellipse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A spiral trajectory"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

As anyone who's seen a mummy knows, ancient Egyptians went to a lot of trouble\nto evade decomposition. So, how successful were they? Living cells constantly renew themselves. Specialized enzymes \ndecompose old structures, and the raw materials \nare used to build new ones. But what happens when someone dies? Their dead cells are no longer\nable to renew themselves, but the enzymes \nkeep breaking everything down. So anyone looking to preserve a body needed to get ahead of those enzymes\nbefore the tissues began to rot. Neurons die quickly, so brains were a lost cause\nto Ancient Egyptian mummifiers, which is why, according \nto Greek historian Herodotus, they started the process\nby hammering a spike into the skull, mashing up the brain, \nflushing it out the nose and pouring tree resins into the skull\nto prevent further decomposition. Brains may decay first,\nbut decaying guts are much worse. The liver, stomach and intestines\ncontain digestive enzymes and bacteria, which, upon death, start eating\nthe corpse from the inside. So the priests removed the lungs\nand abdominal organs first. It was difficult to remove the lungs\nwithout damaging the heart, but because the heart was believed\nto be the seat of the soul, they treated it with special care. They placed the visceral organs in jars filled with a naturally occurring salt\ncalled natron. Like any salt, natron can prevent decay \nby killing bacteria and preventing the body's natural\ndigestive enzymes from working. But natron isn't just any salt. It's mainly a mixture \nof two alkaline salts, soda ash and baking soda. Alkaline salts are especially\ndeadly to bacteria. And they can turn fatty membranes\ninto a hard, soapy substance, thereby maintaining \nthe corpse's structure. After dealing with the internal organs, the priest stuffed the body cavity\nwith sacks of more natron and washed it clean to disinfect the skin. Then, the corpse was set in a bed\nof still more natron for about 35 days \nto preserve its outer flesh. By the time of its removal, the alkaline salts \nhad sucked the fluid from the body and formed hard brown clumps. The corpse wasn't putrid, but it didn't exactly smell good, either. So, priests poured tree resin over\nthe body to seal it, massaged it with a waxy mixture\nthat included cedar oil, and then wrapped it in linen. Finally, they placed the mummy\nin a series of nested coffins and sometimes even a stone sarcophagus. So how successful were \nthe ancient Egyptians at evading decay? On one hand, mummies are definitely not\nintact human bodies. Their brains have been mashed up\nand flushed out, their organs have been removed\nand salted like salami, and about half of their remaining\nbody mass has been drained away. Still, what remains \nis amazingly well-preserved. Even after thousands of years, scientists can perform autopsies \non mummies to determine their causes of death, and possibly even isolate DNA samples. This has given us new information. For example, it seems that air pollution\nwas a serious problem in ancient Egypt, probably because of indoor fires \nused to bake bread. Cardiovascular disease was also common,\nas was tuberculosis. So ancient Egyptians were somewhat\nsuccessful at evading decay. Still, like death, taxes are inevitable. When some mummies were transported,\nthey were taxed as salted fish."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Decomposition:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is a part of life"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Starts as soon as cells die"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Starts when bacteria living in the body start to eat the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Starts when maggots lay eggs on the body"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When preserving a mummy, which organ did the ancient Egyptians remove first?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The brain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The heart"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The liver"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The lungs"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Natron is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Baking soda"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Table salt"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A mixture of two acidic salts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A mixture of two alkaline salts"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Ancient Egyptian mummies do NOT show high rates of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cancer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cardiovascular disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lung disease"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tuberculosis"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Some mummies were taxed as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Smoked meat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Salted meat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Smoked fish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Salted fish"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

And one of the really important questions that comes up about, especially modern art, is well, why is this art? Sal: When you ask me that a bunch of things kind of surface in my brain. It does evoke something in me so I'm inclined to say yes, but then there's a bunch of other things that say well, if I didn't see this in a museum and if I just saw this in the marketing department of Campbell's Soup, would you be viewing it differently? Steven: Because it's advertising then.\nSal: Yes. Steven: But in the context of the museum or in the context of Andy Warhol's studio, it's not quite advertising, right? Sal: Even if it's the exact same thing.\nSteven: Yeah. Sal: And the idea here is by putting it in the museum it's saying look at this in a different way. Steven: Well that's right, it really does relocate it, it does change the meaning, it does transform it, and that's really one of the central ideas of modern art is that you can take something that's not necessarily based in technical skill, because I don't think you would say that this is beautifully rendered.\nSal: Right. Steven: But it relocates it and makes us think about it in a different way. Sal: And so, I guess he would get credit for taking something that was very, almost mundane, something you see in everyone's cupboard, and making it a focal point like you should pay attention to this thing. Steven: I think that's exactly right and I think that he's doing it about a subject that was about as low a subject as one could go. I mean cheap advertising art was something that was so far away from fine art from the great masters and then to focus on something as lowly as a can of soup, and cream of chicken no less, right? (laughs) Sal: A lot of it is, if he did it 50 years earlier, people would have thought this guy's a quack and if he did it now they'd think he was just derivative and... It was really just that time where people happened to think this was art. Steven: I think that that's right. In 1962, what Warhol is doing is he's saying what is it about our culture that is really authentic and important? And it was about mass production, it was about factories. He in a sense said let's not be looking at nature as if we were still an agrarian culture, we're now an industrial culture. What is the stuff of our visual world now? Sal: I think I'm 80 percent there. I remember in college there was a student run art exhibit and as a prank a student actually put a little podium there and put his lunch tray. He put a little placard next to it, you know, lunch tray on Saturday or something is what he called it. So he did it as a prank and everyone thought it was really funny but to some degree it's kind of a sign that maybe what he did was art. Steven: Well I think that's why it was funny because it was so close, right? Sal: And to some degree when someone took a lunch tray and gave it the proper lighting and gave it a podium to look at it and wrote a whole description about it, I did view the lunch tray in a different way. That's kind of the same idea, that something that's such a mundane thing but you use it everyday. I mean, what would you say to that? Was that a prank or was that art? Steven: I think it is a prank but it's also very close to some important art that had been made earlier in the century. He had license to do that because of somebody named Marcel Duchamp. In fact, Warhol had in a sense the same kind of license to not focus on the making of something, not focus on the brushwork, not focus on the composition, not focus on the color, but focus on the refocusing of ideas. Sal: And the reason why we talk about Warhol or Duchamp or any of these people is that, as you said, it's not that they did something technically profound. Obviously Campbell Soup's marketing department had already done something as equally as profound, it's more that they were the people who looked at the world in a slightly different way and highlighted that. Steven: Well I think that that's right. Warhol is also very consciously working towards asking the same questions that the prankster at your school was asking. He's saying can this be art? And in fact he's really pushing it. Look at the painting closely for a moment. This is one of the last paintings that he's actually painted. He's really defined the calligraphy of this Campbell's, he's really sort of rendered the reflection of the tin at the top. But then he stopped and he said, I don't want to paint the fleur de lis. You see those little fleur de lis down at the bottom. I don't want to paint those. So he actually had a little rubber stamp made of them and actually sort of placed them down mechanically. What does that mean for an artist then, to say I don't even want to bother to paint these? I'm just going to find a mechanical process to make this easier. Warhol is doing something I think which is important which is reflecting the way that we manufacture, the way that we construct our world. Think about the things that we surround ourselves with, almost everything was made in a factory. Almost nothing is singular in the world anymore. It's not a world that we would normally find beautiful. Sal: I don't know, sometimes I feel and correct me if I'm wrong, that a decision was made that Warhol was interesting or great and then people will interpret his stuff to justify his greatness. That oh look, he used a printer instead of drawing it which shows that he was reflecting the industrial or whatever, but if he had done it the other way, if he had hand drawn it or hand drawn it with his elbow you know, or finger painted it or something people would say oh isn't this tremendous because we normally would see this thing printed by a machine and now he did it with his hands. How much do you think that is the case or am I just being cynical? Steven: Well no, I think that there's value in a certain degree of cynicism and I think that in some ways what we're really talking about here is what does it mean to be an avant-garde artist? What does it mean to sort of change the language of art and to try to find ways that art relates to our historical moment in some really direct and authentic way? Sal: And maybe it's easy for me to say this because I remember looking at this when I took 5th grade art class, Andy Warhol and all of that, so now it seems almost not that unique but in '62 what I'm hearing is that Warhol was really noteworthy because he really did push people's thinking. Steven: I think that Warhol was looking for, in 1962, a kind of subject matter that was completely outside of the scope of that we could consider fine art. One of his contemporaries, Roy Lichtenstein, was asked what pop art was and he said, \"Well we were looking for subject matter that was so despicable, \"that was so low, that nobody could possibly believe that it was really art.\" And I think you're right, I think now we look at it and it's so much a part of our visual culture that we immediately accept it. But I think that it's really interesting to retrieve just how shocking and radical that was. Sal: This is fascinating. It seems like there's a lot of potential there, that stuff that's pseudo-art made for other purposes, for commercial purposes but if you kind of shine a light on it, in the way that a light has been shone on this, that it does... In your mind would that cross the barrier into being art? Steven: Well I think that, you mentioned before, that if somebody was doing this now it would feel really derivative. And I think that that's right. I think it underscores just how hard it is to find in our culture now, ways of making us see the world in new ways. Sal: Fascinating.

There's no escape,\nexcept for one strange rule. Any prisoner can approach the guards\nat night and ask to leave. If they have green eyes, \nthey'll be released. If not, they'll be tossed \ninto the volcano. As it happens, \nall 100 prisoners have green eyes, but they've lived there since birth, and the dictator has ensured\nthey can't learn their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces, all water is in opaque containers, and most importantly, they're not allowed \nto communicate among themselves. Though they do see each other\nduring each morning's head count. Nevertheless, they all know no one would\never risk trying to leave without absolute certainty of success. After much pressure \nfrom human rights groups, the dictator reluctantly agrees\nto let you visit the island and speak to the prisoners\nunder the following conditions: you may only make one statement, and you cannot tell them \nany new information. What can you say \nto help free the prisoners without incurring the dictator's wrath? After thinking long and hard, you tell the crowd, \n\"At least one of you has green eyes.\" The dictator is suspicious but reassures himself that your statement\ncouldn't have changed anything. You leave, and life on the island\nseems to go on as before. But on the hundredth morning \nafter your visit, all the prisoners are gone, each having asked to leave\nthe previous night. So how did you outsmart the dictator? It might help to realize that the amount\nof prisoners is arbitrary. Let's simplify things\nby imagining just two, Adria and Bill. Each sees one person with green eyes, and for all they know, \nthat could be the only one. For the first night, each stays put. But when they see each other \nstill there in the morning, they gain new information. Adria realizes that if Bill had seen\na non-green-eyed person next to him, he would have left the first night after concluding the statement \ncould only refer to himself. Bill simultaneously realizes \nthe same thing about Adria. The fact that the other person waited tells each prisoner his\nor her own eyes must be green. And on the second morning, \nthey're both gone. Now imagine a third prisoner. Adria, Bill and Carl each see \ntwo green-eyed people, but aren't sure if each of the others\nis also seeing two green-eyed people, or just one. They wait out the first night as before, but the next morning, \nthey still can't be sure. Carl thinks, \"If I have non-green eyes, Adria and Bill were just \nwatching each other, and will now both leave \non the second night.\" But when he sees both \nof them the third morning, he realizes they must \nhave been watching him, too. Adria and Bill have each \nbeen going through the same process, and they all leave on the third night. Using this sort of inductive reasoning, we can see that the pattern will repeat\nno matter how many prisoners you add. The key is the concept \nof common knowledge, coined by philosopher David Lewis. The new information was not contained\nin your statement itself, but in telling it to everyone \nsimultaneously. Now, besides knowing at least one\nof them has green eyes, each prisoner also knows \nthat everyone else is keeping track of all the green-eyed people they can see, and that each of them \nalso knows this, and so on. What any given prisoner doesn't know is whether they themselves are one\nof the green-eyed people the others are keeping track of until as many nights have passed\nas the number of prisoners on the island.

{"page": 45, "lesson": 6, "title": "Football physics: The \"impossible\" free kick - Erez Garty", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/football-physics-the-impossible-free-kick-erez-garty", "transcript": {"en": "In 1997, \nin a game between France and Brazil, a young Brazilian player\nnamed Roberto Carlos set up for a 35 meter free kick. With no direct line to the goal, Carlos decided to attempt \nthe seemingly impossible. His kick sent the ball flying\nwide of the players, but just before going out of bounds,\nit hooked to the left and soared into the goal. According to Newton's first law of motion, an object will move \nin the same direction and velocity until a force is applied on it. When Carlos kicked the ball,\nhe gave it direction and velocity, but what force made the ball swerve and score one of the most magnificent \ngoals in the history of the sport? The trick was in the spin. Carlos placed his kick\nat the lower right corner of the ball, sending it high and to the right,\nbut also rotating around its axis. The ball started its flight\nin an apparently direct route, with air flowing on both sides\nand slowing it down. On one side, the air moved in the opposite\ndirection to the ball's spin, causing increased pressure, while on the other side, the air moved\nin the same direction as the spin, creating an area of lower pressure. That difference made the ball curve\ntowards the lower pressure zone. This phenomenon is called\nthe Magnus effect. This type of kick, \noften referred to as a banana kick, is attempted regularly, and it is one of the elements\nthat makes the beautiful game beautiful. But curving the ball \nwith the precision needed to both bend around the wall\nand back into the goal is difficult. Too high and it soars over the goal. Too low and it hits the ground \nbefore curving. Too wide and it never reaches the goal. Not wide enough \nand the defenders intercept it. Too slow and it hooks too early,\nor not at all. Too fast and it hooks too late. The same physics make it possible to score another \napparently impossible goal, an unassisted corner kick. The Magnus effect was first documented\nby Sir Isaac Newton after he noticed it while playing a game\nof tennis back in 1670. It also applies to golf balls,\nfrisbees and baseballs. In every case, the same thing happens. The ball's spin creates a pressure \ndifferential in the surrounding air flow that curves it \nin the direction of the spin. And here's a question. Could you theoretically \nkick a ball hard enough to make it boomerang \nall the way around back to you? Sadly, no. Even if the ball didn't \ndisintegrate on impact, or hit any obstacles, as the air slowed it, the angle of its deflection \nwould increase, causing it to spiral into smaller \nand smaller circles until finally stopping.

{"page": 45, "lesson": 7, "title": "How to make an attractive city", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/IBuac8Xb", "transcript": {"en": "Cities are a big deal: we pretty much all have to live in them; We should try hard to get them right. So few cities are nice; very, very few out of many thousands are really beautiful. Embarrassingly, the more appealing ones tend to be old, which is weird because we're mostly much better at making things now: cars, planes, or phones. Why not, then, cities? It's crazy to settle for this and to leave something so important to chance. We need to get more scientific and identify the principles that determine how a city gets to be pretty or ugly. It's not a mystery why we like some cities so much better than others. This is a manifesto about how to make attractive cities. There are six fundamental things a city needs to get right. 1. Not too chaotic; Not too ordered One of the things we really love in cities is order. Order means balance, symmetry and repetition; it means the same thing happening again and again, and the left side matching the right side. Order is one of the reasons so many people love Paris. But most cities are a complete mess. When it's a mess, it seems like no one is in charge. And that's worrying. It's horrible when everything is jumbled up. A pitched roof next to a flat roof, a stark geometrical box next to a muddled car park, high rise towers that look as if they've been placed at random, like teeth in a gaping mouth. We generally have an itch to straighten things out, and when we can't, it's frustrating. The same urge is there when we look at cities. Often, it's not skyscrapers that we mind in the city, it's skyscrapers that have been dumped without planning, like they are increasingly in London, whereas New York or Chicago shows the ordered way that we love. However, you have to keep something else in mind: excessive order can be just as much of a problem. Too much regularity can be soul destroying. Too much order feels rigid and alien. It can be bleak, relentless,  and harsh. So the ideal we're seeking is variety and order. This is the idea in a square in Telč in the Czech Republic: where every house is the same width and height but within that ordered pattern, every house has been allowed freedom at the level of form and colour or in Java-eiland in Amsterdam where the pattern is quite strict: each house has the same height and width, the color range is restricted, but within this grid, each unit is completely individual. We're perfectly in the middle between chaos and boringness here. And that's what humans adore. That's what more and more cities should have: order and variety. So as a general rule: too much mess, and it's off putting, but too much simple order, and it's boring. What we crave it's organized complexity which you can see as much here: as here: Now, for the second thing that makes cities beautiful: they have to have visible life. There are streets that are dead and streets that are alive and in general, we crave the live ones. This is a live street in Hong Kong. This is a live scene in Venice. In the 18th century, the painter Canaletto specialized in pictures of cities everyone loved because they're full of life. There's always plenty going on. In this painting we can see a stonemason's yard. The work sheds are rough, but they're charming. It's fascinating to see what people are up to. How do they load those huge blocks onto the gondolas? The life of the city is on display, and we're primed to love this. Contrast this with dead streets of many modern cities. Today, the places where a lot of the work gets done look dull and dead. They're spaced out along huge highways, and you never go there unless you happen to work there yourself because there's nothing to see. And most office buildings are brutally anonymous; the people inside might be working \nin all sorts of fascinating stuff, but we just don't know, and it's disorienting and cold. The street levels are dead. Contrast this with the streets we all love, where you can see things going on: a bakery, a cobbler's shop, and markets selling carpets, a burger bar, a bookshop; these are streets we love because they're full of life. More and more, in modern cities, we've hidden life away. We have lots of dead sheds, and dead towers, connected up by dead motorways where you can barely glimpse your fellow humans. Rather than the old alleyways \nwhere you can see people at work, look them in the eye as they walk down the road and feel connected to others. Modern planners have become obessed by hiding technology rather than trying to make it nice to look at. Today we'de be outraged if we heard a huge pipeline was gonna be slapped across a lovely river; we'd be up in arms! But we book trips to go and see the Roman Pont du Gard in southern France. That's because it's built for beauty and practicality. We think it's the pipe we hate. It's not. It's just the ugliness. So let's make sure our streets are full of life, full of people doing stuff you can see through the windows. That's what make certain cities \nso attractive to walk along: the work is on show, the people are proud of what they're doing and happy to let the world notice and appreciate the practical side of things. There's a third principle of good cities: They are compact. In the past, being able to be alone or just with your partner or family, was at first, a huge achievement. Only the largest class, the poor, lived huddled together and it was horrid. As soon as people had money, \nthey wanted to move out, and have their own plots. Through the later decades of 20th century, more and more people tucked themselves away in a private realm. And it's been a disaster. It's become deadly, cold, and boring, and very, very wasteful on the environment. A compact city like Barcelona swallows a fraction of the energy of a sprawling one like Phoenix, in Arizona. We've built a world of endless dead dormitory suburbs connected by sterile wide motorways all because we labor under the false impression that we want to be far away from other people. But in fact it's wonderful to have the balancing moderating influence of living close to other people in uplifting surroundings. That's why we need tightly packed, well-ordered cities with lots of squares in public places in which we can hang out. All the most beautiful compact cities have squares. Yet, the art of the square has gone into terrible decline. We keep promoting the invention of mobile phones, but no one's built a good square anywhere on this planet for decades. It's not rocket science though. Look at the Piazza di Santa Maria in Trastevere, Rome. It's a public place, but intimate and closed enough to feel like an extension of your home. Lounging about here, having a coffee or a beer, reading a paper, you get to be around other people, their moderating, cheering affect is restoring. It takes you away from the over intense, couple obsessed atmosphere of the home. There's an art to a good square: it should be neither too big nor too small, anything over 30 meters in diameter starts become too large by which we mean: the individual become overly small relative to the space around them, creating a sense of alienation and dislocation. In a good square you should be able to see the face of a person across the square, You could if need be hail someone walking on the other side. The ideal square must offer a feeling of containment, but not claustrophobia. There's another principle of good cities to do with orientation and mystery. By definition, cities are huge, but the cities that a lot of people love also have lots of little back streets and small lanes where you can feel cozy and get a bit lost. We're drawn to the sense of mystery and enclosure that these streets offer. It's actually lovely to get a bit lost. A warren of alleyways can feel homely and intimate. At Cartagena, in Colombia, the balconies nearly touch across the street- you can see your neighbors having breakfast, you know when they've gone to bed, what time the children do their homework on a Sunday evening. The fact that everyone is little bit on display a lot of the time tends to make people nicer. They don't shout at each other quite so much. They put flowers on the table more often. We like it, but we forget that we do, and we don't quite know how to ask for it. Modern planners and developers give us maximum privacy because they suppose that's what we all want, and because they insist that cars and lorries, which like a lot more space than people, are the most important things in the world. Of course we need balance between small streets and big ones. Necessarily, cities are large. We love small streets, but they're a nightmare when you have to go any distance. So the ideal is to have big boulevards, grand, wide straight places, and also little warrens of streets. We need cities that offer us two important pleasures: the pleasures of mystery and the pleasures of orientation. Let's think about scale now. Modern cities are all about big things. Joseph Campbell once wrote: \"If you want to see what a society really believes in, look at what the biggest buildings on the horizon are dedicated to\". The biggest most prominent things tell us about the actual, rather than admitted priorities of a society. We don't collectively say we worship \nsports shoe corporations, tax specialists, the oil industry, and pharmaceuticals. Our cities, however, tell another story. They're full of enormous towers devoted to just these things. That is a bit depressing. As humans, we don't mind things being big, per se, we don't mind being humbled, so long as the things we are bowing to deserve homage, like a beautiful mosque, or a cathedral, or a museum. But we've allowed our cities to be hijacked by aggressive commercial interests, by towers that honor not God, or love, or humanity, but pizza corporations and hedge funds. They exist because we've made a big dumb collective mistake: we focused on who owns land, but we don't think about who owns space, who has air rights. And in the end, who has air rights determines what you can see from your window. We suggest that the ideal height for any city block is five stories high. No more. Above that people start to feel small, insignificant, and trivial. So we say: cut down those towers and pack everything into five stories. Make it dense, compact, and tight, like they do in some parts of Berlin, Amsterdam, London, and Paris, the bits we love. Of course, occasionally there can be a huge building, but let's keep it for something really special, something all of humanity can love. Towers have to be worthy of their prominence, they must be aligned with our best ambitions and long-term needs. Finally, make it local. Somethings should be the same everywhere. We don't expect there to be a uniquely Venezuelan telephone or a distinctively Icelandic bicycle. But, we don't want buildings to look the same everywhere. It's hugely disappointing when you fly somewhere for hours, land, and feel you could be anywhere. The problem isn't just that we like a bit of variation for it's own sake; because of climate, history and social traditions, each society really does have different needs, different strengths and weaknesses. There are many distinct styles of happiness; many good and varied ways of conductive and collective life. The sameness of cities is a problem because it reveals how far each of us must be from engaging with an specific character of it's own place. It's like wearing the same clothes in all climates, or speaking exactly the same way irrespective of who you're talking to. Cities need to have strong characters connected to the use of distinctive local materials and forms. The pale sandstone, of Millbrae Crescent in Glasgow's south side, is a local material, A medium grained, carboniferous, blond sandstone- formed when the Scottish landmass lay near the equator. Or around Cambridge, brick from the local yellowish gault clay is a major traditional material. Or think of the way the great Australian architect, Glenn Murcutt, found ways to put up buildings that reflected the distinctive character Australian life. So the law should be: don't make your city from buildings that could be just anywhere; find a style of architecture that reflects what makes your location specific. The obstacles to building beautiful cities and not economic. Collectively, we've got enough money. We face two main problems: firstly, an intellectual confusion around beauty, and secondly, lack of political will. The intellectual confusion is: we think no one has a right to say what's beautiful and what's ugly; we get worried about who decides; we think beauty is subjective, so surely no one should say anything about it. It's a very understandable qualm, but it's horribly useful to greedy property developers. It's such a relief to these people to learn that there is no such thing as beauty; it means they can get away with murder. We may not agree to the very last point about what a beautiful city is, but we know an ugly one when we see it. No one's ever willingly taken holiday in Frankfurt-on-Main or Birmingham, and there are good reasons for this to do with an objective sense of beauty. So let's stop being dangerously relativistic about this. Yes! There is such a thing as beauty. Sydney and San Francisco and Bath and Bordeaux have it and most other places don't. The proof lies in the tourist statistics. Let's not just say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder; that's just a gift to the next wealthy idiot who wants to put up a horrible tower. The other obstacle is a lack of political will. We've abandoned the design of cities to the greedy rich. We've given up believing in democracy. We've faced and have lost the battle between the public good and commercial opportunism. There will always be a greedy, slick lobby fighting for ugly development, but we can say no. Beautiful cities have only ever been created when governments impose strict and ambitious regulations to keep the greedy, private guys in check. Think of Edinburgh's amazing New Town, which only got of the ground because the government established clear rules to keep developers in check. They were precise legislation detailing heights for buildings, quality of finish, the width of pavements, and a character of the skyline. That's the only way you get beauty. They didn't leave it to the free market. Do that, and you will have chaos. When governments give up on beauty, people start to hate all building. We become collectively despondent. We think we hate all building, and that we can't create beautiful places We get obsessed by restorations and opposed to anything new, which is wrong because we need places to live. Humanity hasn't put up a single beautiful city since about 1905. When Venice was built, no one regretted the lagoons that had been swallowed up. The goal of building, should be to put up things that don't leave us regretting the nature that's been lost because the architecture is every bit the equal of the designs of nature. We can create more beautiful cities, but we have to confront opportunistic developers and our own intellectual confusions. Governments can only create beauty if they have enough public backing. Political will is ultimately about what all of us, the electorate, are asking for. That's why we made this film and hope to awaken you to your power as citizens to help legislate for beautiful cities in the future These are the six rules. Now, it's time to fight to put them in action."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The video recommended that a good city should have a square.

There goes another one. In fact, a supernova occurs every second\nor so in the observable universe, and there is one on average\nevery 25 to 50 years in a galaxy the size \nand age of the Milky Way. Yet we've never actually been able\nto watch one happen from its first violent moments. Of course, how would we? There are hundreds of billions\nof stars close enough that we could watch \nthe supernova explosion break through the surface of the star. But we'd have to have our best telescopes\nfocused on the right one at precisely the right time\nto get meaningful data. Suffice it to say, the odds of that\nhappening are astronomically low. But what if we could anticipate \na supernova before its light reached us? That may seem impossible. After all, nothing travels faster\nthan the speed of light, right? As far as we know, yes. But in a race, fast doesn't matter\nif you take a detour while someone else beelines it\nfor the finish line. For exactly that reason, photons don't win \nthe supernova race to Earth. Neutrinos do. Here's why. There are two types of supernova. Type 1 is when a star accumulates\nso much matter from a neighboring star, that a runaway nuclear reaction ignites\nand causes it to explode. In type 2, the star runs out \nof nuclear fuel, so the gravitational forces pulling in overwhelm the quantum mechanical \nforces pushing out, and the stellar core collapses under\nits own weight in a hundredth of a second. While the outer reaches of the star\nare unaffected by the collapsed core, the inner edges accelerate \nthrough the void, smash into the core,\nand rebound to launch the explosion. In both of these scenarios, the star expels an unparalleled\namount of energy, as well as a great deal of matter. In fact, all atoms heavier than nickel,\nincluding elements like gold and silver, only form in supernova reactions. In type 2 supernovae, about 1% of the energy \nconsists of photons, which we know of as light, while 99% radiates out as neutrinos, the elementary particles that are known\nfor rarely interacting with anything. Starting from the center of the star, the exploding matter takes \ntens of minutes, or even hours, or in rare cases, several days, to reach\nand break through the surface of the star. However, the neutrinos, \nthanks to their non-interactivity, take a much more direct route. By the time there is any visible change\nin the star's suface, the neutrinos typically have a several\nhour head start over the photons. That's why astronomers and physicists have been able to set up a project\ncalled SNEWS, the Supernova Early Warning System. When detectors around the world\npick up bursts of neutrinos, they send messages \nto a central computer in New York. If multiple detectors receive \nsimilar signals within ten seconds, SNEWS will trigger an alert warning\nthat a supernova is imminent. Aided by some distance and direction\ninformation from the neutrino detectors, the amateur astronomers \nand scientists alike will scan the skies and share information to quickly identify \nthe new galactic supernova and turn the world's major \ntelescopes in that direction. The last supernova that sent detectable\nneutrinos to Earth was in 1987 on the edge of the Tarantula Nebula in the large Magellanic Cloud,\na nearby galaxy. Its neutrinos reached Earth about\nthree hours ahead of the visible light. We're due for another one any day now,\nand when that happens, SNEWS should give you the opportunity\nto be among the first to witness something that no human has ever seen before."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why do the neutrinos reach Earth before the photons do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Photons do not travel straight to Earth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "We can see photons better than neutrinos"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neutrinos travel faster than light"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Not enough photons are expelled"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Metals heavier than what element are formed in supernovae?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Copper"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Silver"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nickel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gold"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What percentage of energy from a supernova explosion is expelled as neutrinos?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "90"}, {"label": "C", "text": "99"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A supernova is defined as _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Meteor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Satellite crash"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Planet explosion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Death of a star"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When was the last observable supernova?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1987"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1999"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1978"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1969"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 45, "lesson": 9, "title": "How people rationalize fraud - Kelly Richmond Pope", "category": "Business & Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-people-rationalize-fraud-kelly-richmond-pope", "transcript": {"en": "If you ask people whether \nthey think stealing is wrong, most of them would answer, \"Yes.\" And yet, in 2013, organizations\nall over the world lost an estimated total\nof 3.7 trillion dollars to fraud, which includes crimes like embezzlement, pyramid schemes, and false insurance claims. This wasn't just the work\nof a few bad apples. The truth is that many people\nare susceptible not only to the temptation \nto commit fraud but to convincing themselves\nthat they've done nothing wrong. So why does fraud happen? While individual motivations \nmay differ from case to case, the fraud triangle, a model developed\nby criminologist Donald Cressey, shows three conditions \nthat make fraud likely: pressure, opportunity,\nand rationalization. Pressure is often what motivates someone\nto engage in fraud to begin with. It could be a personal debt, an addiction, an earnings quota, a sudden job loss, or an illness in the family. As for opportunity, many people\nin both public and private sectors have access to tools that enable them\nto commit and conceal fraud: corporate credit cards, internal company data, or control over the budget. The combination of pressure and being exposed to such opportunities\non a daily basis can create a strong temptation. But even with these two elements, most fraud still requires rationalization. Many fraudsters are first time offenders, so in order to commit an act\nmost would regard as wrong, they need to justify it to themselves. Some feel entitled to the money\nbecause they are underpaid and overworked and others believe \ntheir fraud is victimless, perhaps even planning to return\nthe money once their crisis is resolved. Some of the most common types of fraud don't even register as such\nto the perpetrator. Examples include employees\nfudging time sheets or expense reports, taxpayers failing to report cash earnings, or service providers overbilling\ninsurance companies. Though these may seem small, and can sometimes\nonly involve hundreds of dollars, they all contribute to the big picture. And then there's fraud on a massive scale. In 2003, Italian dairy food giant \nParmalat went bankrupt after it was found to have fabricated\na 4 billion dollar bank account and falsified financial statements to hide the fact that its subsidiaries\nhad been losing money. Because it was family controlled, corporate governance \nand regulator supervision were difficult, and the company likely hoped \nthat the losses could be recouped before anyone found out. And it's not just corporate greed. Governments and non-profits\nare also susceptible to fraud. During her time as City Comptroller\nfor Dixon, Illinois, Rita Crundwell embezzled \nover 53 million dollars. Rita was one of the country's leading \nquarter horse breeders and winner of 52 world championships. But the cost of maintaining the herd\nran to 200,000 dollars per month. Because her position gave her complete\ncontrol over city finances, she was easily able to divert money to an account she used \nfor private expenses, and the scheme went \nunnoticed for 20 years. It is believed that Crundwell\nfelt entitled to a lavish lifestyle based on her position, and the notoriety \nher winnings brought to the city. It's tempting to think of fraud\nas a victimless crime because corporations \nand civic institutions aren't people. But fraud harms real people\nin virtually every case: the employees of Parmalat \nwho lost their jobs, the citizens of Dixon whose taxes\nsubsidized horse breeding, the customers of companies\nwhich raise their prices to offset losses. Sometimes the effects are obvious\nand devestating, like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands\nof people to lose their life savings. But often they're subtle\nand not easy to untangle.

I know that when I'm in the air sometimes I feel like I don't ever\nhave to come down.\" But thanks to Isaac Newton, we know that what goes up\nmust eventually come down. In fact, the human limit \non a flat surface for hang time, or the time from when your feet leave\nthe ground to when they touch down again, is only about one second, and, yes, that even includes his airness, whose infamous dunk \nfrom the free throw line has been calculated at .92 seconds. And, of course, gravity is what's making it\nso hard to stay in the air longer. Earth's gravity pulls all nearby objects\ntowards the planet's surface, accelerating them \nat 9.8 meters per second squared. As soon as you jump,\ngravity is already pulling you back down. Using what we know about gravity, we can derive a fairly simple equation\nthat models hang time. This equation states that the height\nof a falling object above a surface is equal to the object's initial height\nfrom the surface plus its initial velocity multiplied by how many seconds\nit's been in the air, plus half of the \ngravitational acceleration multiplied by the square of the number\nof seconds spent in the air. Now we can use this equation to model\nMJ's free throw dunk. Say MJ starts, as one does,\nat zero meters off the ground, and jumps with an initial vertical\nvelocity of 4.51 meters per second. Let's see what happens if we model\nthis equation on a coordinate grid. Since the formula is quadratic, the relationship between height\nand time spent in the air has the shape of a parabola. So what does it tell us about MJ's dunk? Well, the parabola's vertex shows us\nhis maximum height off the ground at 1.038 meters, and the X-intercepts tell us \nwhen he took off and when he landed,\nwith the difference being the hang time. It looks like Earth's gravity\nmakes it pretty hard for even MJ to get some solid hang time. But what if he were playing an away game\nsomewhere else, somewhere far? Well, the gravitational acceleration\non our nearest planetary neighbor, Venus, is 8.87 meters per second squared, \npretty similar to Earth's. If Michael jumped here with the same\nforce as he did back on Earth, he would be able to get more \nthan a meter off the ground, giving him a hang time \nof a little over one second.

Chey", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-the-big-deal-with-gluten-william-d-chey", "transcript": {"en": "Maybe you've recently seen the phrase\n\"gluten-free\" on food packaging, or take-out menus, shampoo bottles,\napartment listings, the tag of your shirt, on a hammer, as a lower back tattoo,\nor in your friend's resume. Next time someone starts telling you\nabout their newfound freedom from gluten, here are some questions you can ask, and the well-informed answers\nthat your friend, being a reasonable individual\nmaking educated dietary choices, and by no means just following \nthe latest diet craze, will tell you. What is gluten? Gluten is an insoluble protein composite made up of two proteins \nnamed gliadin and glutenin. Where might you encounter gluten? Gluten is found in certain grains,\nparticularly wheat, rye and barley. What has gluten been doing for\nthe previous entirety of human history, and why do you suddenly care about it? Gluten is responsible \nfor the elastic consistency of dough and the chewiness of foods \nmade from wheat flour, like bread and pasta. For some people, \nthese foods cause problems, namely wheat allergy, celiac disease,\nand non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Wheat allergy is an uncommon condition that occurs when a person's immune system mounts an allergic response \nto wheat proteins, leading to mild problems,\nand in rare cases, a potential dangerous reaction\ncalled anaphylaxis. Celiac disease is an inherited disease, in which eating foods with gluten leads to inflammation and damage\nof the lining of the small intestine. This impairs intestinal function, leading to problems like belly pain,\nbloating, gas, diarrhea, weight loss, skin rash, bone problems\nlike osteoporosis, iron deficiency, small stature, \ninfertility, fatigue and depression. Untreated, celiac disease \nincreases the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Celiac disease is present in one \nin every 100 to 200 persons in the U.S. When blood tests suggest \nthe possibility of celiac, the diagnosis is confirmed with a biopsy. The most effective treatment\nis a gluten-free diet, which helps heal intestinal damage\nand improve symptoms. Some people don't have celiac disease\nor a wheat allergy, but still experience symptoms\nwhen they eat foods with gluten. These people have non-celiac\ngluten sensitivity. They experience painful gut symptoms and suffer from fatigue, brain fog,\njoint pain or skin rash. A gluten-free diet typically helps\nwith these symptoms. So how many people actually\nhave this gluten sensitivity you speak of? Gluten sensitivity's occurrence \nin the general population is unclear, but likely much more common\nthan wheat allergy or celiac disease. Diagnosis is based \non the development of symptoms, the absence of wheat allergy\nand celiac disease, and subsequent improvement\non a gluten-free diet. There's no reliable blood or tissue test, partly because gluten sensitivity\nisn't a single disease, and has a number \nof different possible causes. For example, it may be the case that gluten can activate the immune system\nin the small intestine, or cause it to become leaky. But sometimes, people claiming\ngluten sensitivity are actually sensitive \nnot to wheat proteins, but sugars found in wheat and other foods,\ncalled fructans. The human intestine can't break down\nor absorb fructans, so they make their way \nto the large intestine or colon, where they're fermented by bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids\nand gases. This leads to unpleasant symptoms\nin some people with bowel problems. Another possible explanation behind\ngluten sensitivity is the nocebo effect. This occurs when a person believes\nsomething will cause problems, and because of that belief, it does. It's the opposite of the more well-known\nand much more fortuitous placebo effect. Given how much bad press \ngluten is getting in the media, the nocebo response may play a role for some people who think\nthey're sensitive to gluten. For all these reasons, it's clear that \nthe problems people develop when they eat wheat and other grains\naren't exclusively due to gluten. So a better name than\nnon-celiac gluten sensitivty might be wheat intolerance."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Gluten can be found in which type of grains?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wheat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rye"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Barley"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "An inherited disease in which eating gluten inflames and damages the lining of the small intenstine is called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A wheat allergy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anaphylaxis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Celiac disease"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Non-celiac gluten sensitivity"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Painful gut symptoms, fatigue, brain fog, joint pain and skin rash are all symptoms of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A wheat allergy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anaphylaxis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Celiac disease"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Non-celiac gluten sensitivity"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The human intenstines cannot break down or absorb fructans which leads to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fermentation by bacteria"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Production of short chain fatty acids and gases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both A and B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When a person believes something will cause problems and because of that belief, it does, it is called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bad press"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A placebo effect"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sensitivity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nocebo effect"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

For example,\ntyphoid-- which causes fever, abdominal pain,\ndelirium, and can kill you-- smells like freshly\nbaked brown bread. Other infections smell\ntotally differently.

Let us welcome you to the final day of\ndramatic battle between great tragedians. It is a spring day here in Ancient Greece. Nearly 17,000 patrons are filing\ninto the Theatre of Dionysus to watch top playwrights, including favorites Aeschylus\nand Sophocles duke it out to see whose hero \nmay be deemed most tragic, whose story most awful. Well Seacrestopolis, in last week's battle of the choruses, all 50 members of each playwright's chorus\ntraveled back and forth across the stage, singing the strophe and antistrophe,\ntelling misbegotten tales of woe. Today's first chorus is entering \nthrough the parados, taking their positions in the orchestra\nat the bottom of the stage. Mario Lopedokia, this is nothing\nwe haven't seen before. All 50 members speaking\nfrom the depths of their souls. Wait, what is this? I've not seen this before, Seacrestopolis. There is one actor stepping out\nof choral formation, assuming an independent role in this play. Can you make out who it is? That looks like Thespis. It seems he's changing his mask, and taking on the role \nof another character. Incredible. Surely, Thespis will go down\nin history as the very first actor. He has changed \nthe face of theater forever. And that was just the warm-up act. On to the main attraction. Aeschylus will have the stage first. Let's see what he does. We expect great things. Last competition, \nSophocles beat him by a smidge, but Aeschylus is still considered\nthe Father of Tragedy. Now, Aeschylus frequently competes\nat this festival, the city Dionysia. Though his plays are violent, the bloodshed is never \nseen by the audience, which allows the dramatic tension\nto take center stage. Let's see what he does today\nto try to win his title back. Here comes Aeschylus's chorus, but they seem to be missing \nquite a few people. What is going on here? Not only are they down a few people. There are two actors taking center stage. This is absolutely unheard of. He has build on Thespis's idea\nand added a second actor to the mix. Aeschylus is relying on \nthe two individuals to tell the story. The dialogue possible in tragedy\nnow has taken precedence over the chorus. No wonder he drastically shrunk its size. This applause is well deserved. The crowd has hushed. Sophocles's actors and chorus are taking the stage for the play,\n\"Oedipus Rex.\" As usual, the chorus \nis set up in the orchestra. And what's this? Sophocles has added a third actor. Will this one-upmanship never end? Three actors, and they are changing their masks\nto take on several different roles as they weave the tale of Oedipus, a nice fellow who kills his father\nand marries his mother. Kills his father and marries his mother. That sounds pretty tragic to me. It is most tragic, Mario Lopedokia. Call me crazy, but I'm willing to bet\nthat future generations will hold this play up \nas the perfect example of tragedy. Excuse me, Seacrestopolis. Oedipus has left the stage after realizing\nJocasta was his wife and also his mother. Where has he gone? I can't even imagine. Wait. The messenger has stepped on stage and is telling us \nof the great king's actions. He says that Oedipus, upon finding\nhis mother, wife, whatever, Jocasta, dead of her own hand \nin their incestuous bedroom, took the broaches from her dress\nand stabbed his eyes repeatedly. You can't blame the guy, can you? Bedded his mother, killed his father,\nis father and brother to his children. I might do the same. My friend, I do believe we've seen it all. Indeed, we have. There is nothing more tragic than Oedipus. And sure enough, the judges who have\nbeen chosen by lot from all over Greece are ready to announce the winner. Oh, folks! This is one \nfor the history books. Dark horse playwright, Philocles,\nhas taken first prize. What an upset. What a tragedy. What a night, folks. We have witnessed the laying\nof the foundation of modern theater and some great innovations: the shrinking of the chorus, the addition of three actors, and such catharsis. Doesn't a great tragedy just make you feel\nrenewed and cleansed? It sure does, but now we are out of time. I'm Seacrestopolis, and I'm Mario Lopedokia.

What do they all have in common? Among other things, they're huge\nbecause they have to carry people, fuel, and all sorts of supplies, \nscientific instruments, and, in rare cases, planet-killing lasers. But the next real-world generation \nof spacecraft may be much, much smaller. We're talking fit-inside-your-pocket tiny. Imagine sending a swarm of these\nmicrospacecraft out into the galaxy. They could explore \ndistant stars and planets by carrying sophisticated \nelectronic sensors that would measure everything\nfrom temperature to cosmic rays. You could deploy thousands of them for the cost of a single \nspace shuttle mission, exponentially increasing \nthe amount of data we could collect about the universe. And they're individually expendable, meaning that we could send them \ninto environments that are too risky \nfor a billion dollar rocket or probe. Several hundred small spacecraft\nare already orbiting the Earth, taking pictures of outer space, and collecting data on things, like the behavior of bacteria \nin the Earth's atmosphere and magnetic signals that could help\npredict earthquakes. But imagine how much more we could learn\nif they could fly beyond Earth's orbit. That's exactly what organizations,\nlike NASA, want to do: send microspacecraft \nto scout habitable planets and describe astronomical phenomena\nwe can't study from Earth. But something so small can't carry \na large engine or tons of fuel, so how would such a vessel propel itself? For microspacecraft, it turns out, \nyou need micropropulsion. On really small scales, some of the familiar \nrules of physics don't apply, in particular, everyday \nNewtonian mechanics break down, and forces that are normally negligible\nbecome powerful. Those forces include surface tension\nand capillary action, the phenomena \nthat govern other small things. Micropropulsion systems can harness\nthese forces to power spacecraft. One example of how this might work is called microfluidic \nelectrospray propulsion. It's a type of ion thruster, which means that it shoots out\ncharged particles to generate momentum. One model being developed at NASA's\njet propulsion laboratory is only a couple centimeters \non each side. Here's how it works. That postage-stamp sized metal plate\nis studded with a hundred skinny needles and coated with a metal \nthat has a low melting point, like indium. A metal grid sits above the needles, and an electric field is set up\nbetween the grid and the plate. When the plate is heated,\nthe indium melts and capillary action draws \nthe liquid metal up the needles. The electric field tugs \nthe molten metal upwards, while surface tension pulls it back, causing the indium to deform into a cone. The small radius of the tips \nof the needles makes it possible for the electric field\nto overcome the surface tension, and when that happens, positively charged ions shoot off at\nspeeds of tens of kilometers per second. That stream of ions propels the spacecraft\nin the opposite direction, thanks to Newton's third law. And while each ion \nis an extremely small particle, the combined force of so many of them\npushing away from the craft is enough to generate \nsignificant acceleration. And unlike the exhaust \nthat pours out of a rocket engine, this stream is much smaller\nand far more fuel efficient, which makes it better suited\nfor long deep-space missions. These micropropulsion systems\nhaven't been fully tested yet, but some scientists think that they\nwill provide enough thrust to break small craft out of Earth's orbit. In fact, they're predicting that thousands\nof microspacecraft will be launched in the next ten years to gather data that today \nwe can only dream about.

Your phone utters \nits final plaintive \"bleep\" and cuts out in the middle of your call. In that moment, you may feel more\nlike throwing your battery across the room than singing its praises, but batteries are a triumph of science. They allow smartphones \nand other technologies to exist without anchoring us \nto an infernal tangle of power cables. Yet even the best batteries\nwill diminish daily, slowly losing capacity \nuntil they finally die. So why does this happen, and how do our batteries even store\nso much charge in the first place? It all started in the 1780s\nwith two Italian scientists, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, and a frog. Legend has it that as Galvani\nwas studying a frog's leg, he brushed a metal instrument \nup against one of its nerves, making the leg muscles jerk. Galvani called this animal electricity, believing that a type of electricity\nwas stored in the very stuff of life. But Volta disagreed, arguing that it was the metal itself\nthat made the leg twitch. The debate was eventually settled\nwith Volta's groundbreaking experiment. He tested his idea with a stack\nof alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper or cloth\nsoaked in a salt water solution. What happened in Volta's cell is something\nchemists now call oxidation and reduction. The zinc oxidizes,\nwhich means it loses electrons, which are, in turn, gained by the ions in\nthe water in a process called reduction, producing hydrogen gas. Volta would have been shocked \nto learn that last bit. He thought the reaction \nwas happening in the copper, rather than the solution. None the less, \nwe honor Volta's discovery today by naming our standard unit \nof electric potential \"the volt.\" This oxidation-reduction cycle creates\na flow of electrons between two substances and if you hook a lightbulb \nor vacuum cleaner up between the two, you'll give it power. Since the 1700s, scientists have improved\non Volta's design. They've replaced the chemical solution\nwith dry cells filled with chemical paste, but the principle is the same. A metal oxidizes, \nsending electrons to do some work before they are regained \nby a substance being reduced. But any battery has a finite \nsupply of metal, and once most of it has oxidized, \nthe battery dies. So rechargeable batteries give us \na temporary solution to this problem by making the oxidation-reduction \nprocess reversible. Electrons can flow back \nin the opposite direction with the application of electricity. Plugging in a charger draws \nthe electricity from a wall outlet that drives the reaction \nto regenerate the metal, making more electrons available \nfor oxidation the next time you need them. But even rechargeable batteries \ndon't last forever. Over time, the repetition of this process\ncauses imperfections and irregularities in the metal's surface\nthat prevent it from oxidizing properly. The electrons are no longer available\nto flow through a circuit and the battery dies. Some everyday rechargeable batteries will die after only hundreds \nof discharge-recharge cycles, while newer, advanced batteries\ncan survive and function for thousands. Batteries of the future \nmay be light, thin sheets that operate on the principles \nof quantum physics and last for hundreds \nof thousands of charge cycles. But until scientists find a way \nto take advantage of motion to recharge your cell battery,\nlike cars do, or fit solar panels \nsomewhere on your device, plugging your charger into the wall, rather than expending \none battery to charge another is your best bet to forestall \nthat fatal \"bleep.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Scientists in the 1700's were aware of electricity, but they were not sure _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How to observe it in experiments"}, {"label": "B", "text": "What caused electric current to flow"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whether electricity had any effect on living organisms"}, {"label": "D", "text": "If electricity would flow through metal"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Oxidation and reduction are processes through which _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Electricity is created from solar energy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Substances lose and gain electrons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A substance changes from one metal into another"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gas molecules are converted to solid metal"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Rechargeable batteries are different than standard batteries because _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their oxidation-reduction reactions are reversible"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They can be reused indefinitely"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They rely on moving protons instead of moving electrons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They rely on oxidation, but not reduction"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Rechargeable batteries can no longer function when _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are unplugged from a wall charger"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They have been recharged 10 times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The temperature is too low"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Changes to their surfaces prevent electrons from flowing"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Batteries enable us to _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Store electric charge in a portable way"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Always stay connected to the power grid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Create electrical energy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Convert solar energy into electrical energy"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

In fact, OCD, which stands \nfor obsessive compulsive disorder, is a serious psychiatric condition that is frequently \nmisunderstood by society and mental health professionals alike. So let's start by debunking some myths. Myth one: repetitive or ritualistic\nbehaviors are synonymous with OCD. As its name suggests, obsessive compulsive disorder\nhas two aspects: the intrusive thoughts, images,\nor impulses, known as obsessions, and the behavioral \ncompulsions people engage in to relieve the anxiety \nthe obsessions cause. The kinds of actions that people often \nassociate with OCD, like excessive hand washing,\nor checking things repeatedly, may be examples of obsessive\nor compulsive tendencies that many of us exhibit from time to time. But the actual disorder is far more rare\nand can be quite debilitating. People affected have little or no\ncontrol over their obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors, which tend to be time consuming and interfere with work, \nschool or social life to the point of causing \nsignificant distress. This set of diagnostic criteria is what\nseparates people suffering from OCD from those who may \njust be a bit more meticulous or hygiene obsessed than usual. Myth two: the main symptom of OCD\nis excessive hand washing. Although hand washing is the most common\nimage of OCD in popular culture, obsessions and compulsions\ncan take many different forms. Obsessions can manifest \nas fears of contamination and illness, worries about harming others, or preoccupations with numbers,\npatterns, morality, or sexual identity. And compulsions can range from\nexcessive cleaning or double checking, to the fastidious arrangement of objects, or walking in predetermined patterns. Myth three: individuals with OCD don't understand\nthat they are acting irrationally. Many individuals with OCD actually\nunderstand the relationship between their obsessions \nand compulsions quite well. Being unable to avoid \nthese thoughts and actions despite being aware of their irrationality is part of the reason\nwhy OCD is so distressing. OCD sufferers report feeling crazy for experiencing anxiety \nbased on irrational thoughts and finding it difficult \nto control their responses. So what exactly causes OCD? The frustrating answer \nis we don't really know. However, we have some important clues. OCD is considered \na neurobiological disorder. In other words, research suggests \nthat OCD sufferers brains are actually hardwired \nto behave in a certain fashion. Research has implicated \nthree regions of the brain variously involved in social behavior\nand complex cognitive planning, voluntary movement, and emotional and motivational responses. The other piece of the puzzle is that OCD is associated \nwith low levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter \nthat communicates between brain structures and helps regulate vital processes, such as mood, aggression, impulse control, sleep, appetite, \nbody temperature and pain. But are serotonin and activity \nin these brain regions the sources of OCD or symptoms of an unknown\nunderlying cause of the disorder. We probably won't know until we have a much more intimate \nunderstanding of the brain. The good news is there are \neffective treatments for OCD, including medications, which increase\nserotonin in the brain by limiting its reabsorption \nby brain cells, behavioral therapy that gradually\ndesensitizes patients to their anxieties, and in some cases, \nelectroconvulsive therapy, or surgery, when OCD doesn't respond\nto other forms of treatment. Knowing that your own brain \nis lying to you while not being able \nto resist its commands can be agonizing. But with knowledge and understanding\ncomes the power to seek help, and future research into the brain may finally provide \nthe answers we're looking for."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Fear of contracting an illness such as HIV from touching public surfaces is referred to as a(n) _____ whereas frequently washing your hands in scalding hot water after touching such surfaces is referred to as a(n) _____?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Compulsion; obsession"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Delusion; compulsion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Obsession; compulsion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "All of the following are types of obsessions except?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fear of contamination"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Scrupulosity or religiosity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fear of harming others"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Checking the locks"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following are treatment options for OCD?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "SSRIs (Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Surgery"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Exposure and response prevention"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is considered to be the cause of OCD?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Genetics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Specific brain abnormalities"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Still unknown"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following chemicals has been the most implicated in OCD?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Epinephrine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Serotonin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cortisol"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

You can find it in mosques,\nmadrasas, palaces and private homes. This tradition began in the 8th century CE\nduring the early history of Islam, when craftsmen took preexisting motifs\nfrom Roman and Persian cultures and developed them into new forms\nof visual expression. This period of history was a golden age\nof Islamic culture, during which many achievements \nof previous civilizations were preserved and further developed, resulting in fundamental advancements\nin scientific study and mathematics. Accompanying this was an increasingly\nsophisticated use of abstraction and complex geometry in Islamic art, from intricate floral motifs\nadorning carpets and textiles, to patterns of tilework that seemed\nto repeat infinitely, inspiring wonder \nand contemplation of eternal order. Despite the remarkable complexity\nof these designs, they can be created \nwith just a compass to draw circles and a ruler to make lines within them. And from these simple tools emerges \na kaleidoscope multiplicity of patterns. So how does that work? Well, everything starts with a circle. The first major decision \nis how will you divide it up? Most patterns split the circle\ninto four, five or six equal sections. And each division gives rise\nto distinctive patterns. There's an easy way to determine\nwhether any pattern is based on fourfold, fivefold, or sixfold symmetry. Most contain stars surrounded\nby petal shapes. Counting the number \nof rays on a starburst, or the number of petals around it, tells us what category \nthe pattern falls into. A star with six rays,\nor surrounded by six petals, belongs in the sixfold category. One with eight petals is part\nof the fourfold category, and so on. There's another secret ingredient\nin these designs: an underlying grid. Invisible, but essential to every pattern, the grid helps determine the scale\nof the composition before work begins, keeps the pattern accurate, and facilitates the invention \nof incredible new patterns. Let's look at an example of how these\nelements come together. We'll start with a circle within a square,\nand divide it into eight equal parts. We can then draw a pair\nof criss-crossing lines and overlay them with another two. These lines are called construction lines, and by choosing a set of their segments, we'll form the basis \nof our repeating pattern. Many different designs are possible\nfrom the same construction lines just by picking different segments. And the full pattern finally emerges when we create a grid with many\nrepetitions of this one tile in a process called tessellation. By choosing a different set \nof construction lines, we might have created this pattern, or this one. The possibilities are virtually endless. We can follow the same steps\nto create sixfold patterns by drawing construction lines\nover a circle divided into six parts, and then tessellating it,\nwe can make something like this. Here's another sixfold pattern\nthat has appeared across the centuries and all over the Islamic world, including Marrakesh, Agra, Konya\nand the Alhambra. Fourfold patterns fit in a square grid,\nand sixfold patterns in a hexagonal grid. Fivefold patterns, however,\nare more challenging to tessellate because pentagons \ndon't neatly fill a surface, so instead of just creating \na pattern in a pentagon, other shapes have to be added\nto make something that is repeatable, resulting in patterns that may seem\nconfoundingly complex, but are still relatively simple to create. Also, tessellation is not constrained\nto simple geometric shapes, as M.C. Escher's work demonstrates. And while the Islamic \ngeometric design tradition doesn't tend to employ elements \nlike fish and faces, it does sometimes make use of multiple \nshapes to craft complex patterns. This more than 1,000-year-old tradition\nhas wielded basic geometry to produce works that are intricate,\ndecorative and pleasing to the eye. And these craftsmen prove just how\nmuch is possible with some artistic intuition, creativity,\ndedication and a great compass and ruler."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which two cultures influenced the early development of Islamic geometric design?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Roman and Persian"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Persian and Celtic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Roman and Celtic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Greek and Roman"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Every Islamic geometric pattern begins with a circle.

{"page": 45, "lesson": 20, "title": "Sunlight is way older than you think - Sten Odenwald", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/sunlight-is-way-older-than-you-think-sten-odenwald", "transcript": {"en": "You may know that it takes light\na zippy eight minutes to reach us from the surface of the Sun, so how long do you think it takes light to travel from the Sun's core\nto its surface? A few seconds or a minute at most? Well, oddly enough, the answer\nis many thousands of years. Here's why. Photons are produced by the nuclear \nreactions deep in the core of our Sun. As the photons flow out of the core,\nthey interact with matter and lose energy, becoming longer wavelength forms of light. They start out as gamma rays in the core, but end up as x-rays, ultraviolet\nor visible light as they near the surface. However, that journey\nis neither simple nor direct. Upon being born, each photon travels at\na speed of 300,000 kilometers per second until it collides with a proton\nand is diverted in another direction, acting like a bullet ricocheting off\nof every charged particle it strikes. The question of how far this photon gets\nfrom the center of the Sun after each collision is known as the random walk problem. The answer is given by this formula: distance equals step size times the square\nroot of the number of steps. So if you were taking a random walk \nfrom your front door with a one meter stride each second, it would take you a million steps\nand eleven days just to travel one kilometer. So then how long does it take for a photon\ngenerated in the center of the sun to reach you? We know the mass of the Sun and can use that to calculate the number\nof protons within it. Let's assume for a second that all \nthe Sun's protons are evenly spread out, making the average distance between them\nabout 1.0 x 10^-10 meters. To random walk the 690,000 kilometers\nfrom the core to the solar surface would then require 3.9 x 10^37 steps, giving a total travel time \nof 400 billion years. Hmm, that can't be right. The Sun is only 4.6 billion years old,\nso what went wrong? Two things: The Sun isn't actually of uniform density and photons will miss quite a few protons\nbetween every collision. In actuality, a photon's energy, which changes over \nthe course of its journey, determines how likely it is \nto interact with a proton. On the density question, our models show that the Sun\nhas a hot core, where the fusion reactions occur. Surrounding that is the radiative zone, followed by the convective zone,\nwhich extends all the way to the surface. The material in the core \nis much denser than lead, while the hot plasma near the surface\nis a million times less dense with a continuum of densities in between. And here's the photon-energy relationship. For a photon that carries\na small amount of energy, a proton is effectively huge, and it's much more likely to cause\nthe photon to ricochet. And for a high-energy photon,\nthe opposite is true. Protons are effectively tiny. Photons start off at very high energies compared to when they're finally radiated\nfrom the Sun's surface. Now when we use a computer\nand a sophisticated solar interior model to calculate the random walk equation \nwith these changing quantities, it spits out the following number:\n170,000 years. Future discoveries about the Sun\nmay refine this number further, but for now, \nto the best of our understanding, the light that's hitting your eyes today spent 170,000 years pinballing its way\ntowards the Sun's surface, plus eight miniscule minutes in space. In other words, that photon \nbegan its journey two ice ages ago, around the same time when humans\nfirst started wearing clothes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long does it take light from the surface of the Sun to reach Earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A few seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A minute at most"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eight minutes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No one can calculate it because it is so long."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Photons flow out of the core, interact with matter, lose energy, and become longer wavelength forms of light changing from gamma rays in the core to other forms of light.
