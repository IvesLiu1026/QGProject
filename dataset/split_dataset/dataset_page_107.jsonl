The prophet Muhammad united the people\nof the Arabian Peninsula through the formation of Islam. These people included both \nnomadic Bedouin tribes and the inhabitants of oasis cities\nlike Mecca and Medina. Until Muhammad’s time, the region \nhadn’t been considered a serious match for the powerful neighboring \nPersian and Byzantine empires. But the alliance Muhammad formed \nwas political as well as religious, an empire with Medina \nas its political heart and a force to be reckoned with. Muhammad was a one-of-a-kind leader. He had been a member of the Quraysh,\nthe tribe that controlled Mecca. After Muhammad’s death, those close to him deliberated\nwho should succeed him— a contentious question. Abū Bakr, Muhammad’s father-in-law, emerged victorious and became \nthe new caliph, or successor. Over the next 30 years, four caliphs,\nall from Muhammad's tribe, conquered vast areas beyond Arabia, including their mighty neighbors, \nthe Persians and the Byzantines. But as the empire expanded, \ndissent within it grew and a civil war erupted. The fourth caliph, Ali, was assassinated. Afterwards, the Umayyad Dynasty\ncame to power. The Umayyads were from the same tribe\nas Muhammad, but from a different, rival clan. They extended the empire’s reach\nfrom present-day Spain to India and made Damascus their capital. But an empire this vast, \nfull of many different peoples, was at risk of conflict and fracture. The Umayyads stabilized it by replacing\nthe ruling elite in conquered territories with Muslim officials, while largely allowing the day-to-day\ncustoms of local populations— including their religious preferences—\nto continue. Arabic was used \nas the administrative language, unifying political affairs\nacross the empire, but people continued to speak and write\nlocal languages, too. Still, many in the empire were\ndissatisfied with Umayyad rule and questioned the dynasty's legitimacy. The Abbasid family capitalized\non these sentiments, promoting themselves as more direct\ndescendants of the prophet, though their actual relation to Muhammad\nwas more tenuous than they claimed. They overthrew the Umayyad caliphate\nin 750 CE, becoming the second great dynasty\nof the Islamic Empire. To establish themselves as the new rulers, they relocated the capital once more, this time building a new city: Baghdad. Under Abbasid rule, the elite \nenjoyed a lifestyle of luxury, thanks to extensive trade networks\nthat brought both products and people from all over the known world to Baghdad. Byzantine, Persian, Indian and Arab\ncultures and knowledge intermingled, leading to artistic and scientific\nadvancement. The caliph was wealthy and powerful\nbeyond imagination. But there was never a clear line \nof succession dictating who would become\nthe next caliph. Any male relative of the former caliph \nwas eligible, so brothers, nephews, and uncles \nfought to gain power. Within the court, army officers, wives, \nconcubines, and government officials all demanded their share of the treasury. Because the caliph depended \non his entourage to stay in power, each transition of rulership opened\nthe doors for favoritism and corruption. Outside the court, many questioned the legitimacy\nof the caliph, noting that the caliph’s religious duty\nto moral excellence was at odds with the court’s \ndecadent displays of wealth. In 1258 CE, the Mongols\napproached Baghdad. They encountered little resistance \nas they thoroughly destroyed the city. Legend has it that they rolled\nthe caliph in a rug and had horses trample him to death, and that the Tigris River ran\nblack from the ink of the manuscripts that were thrown into it. The siege of Baghdad laid bare\na longstanding reality: for centuries, the caliphs had\nruled mostly symbolically. Local leaders throughout the empire\nhad grown more powerful, and they refused to pay taxes, spending the money on their own courts\ninstead. The time of one united Islamic Empire\nwas over, but its influence \nthrough written and spoken Arabic, Islam, and the ideas \nof its greatest intellectuals, left a lasting mark on the world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why was Muhammad a “one-of-a-kind” leader?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because he was Arab"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because he was the founder of a new religion, the spiritual leader of the community, and the military and political leader of a vast newly-conquered empire."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because he received his message from God."}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the major cause of fighting among early Muslims?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They couldn’t agree on who should become the new (political) leader of the religious community and the large empire."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ethnic tensions."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They could not agree on who should be the next prophet."}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Did Islamic conquest involve large-scale forced conversion?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes, the Arabs wanted all non-Muslims to convert."}, {"label": "B", "text": "No, in general people could maintain their own religion, though there are examples where this was not the case."}, {"label": "C", "text": "No one converted during the Islamic conquest."}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Did Mecca and Medina remain political centers throughout the history of the Islamic Empire?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "No, Damascus became the capital until the fall of the empire in the 13th century."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yes, Mecca and Medina were always the most important cities."}, {"label": "C", "text": "No, Mecca and Medina remained important religious centers, but shortly after the conquests the political power moved first to Damascus and later to Baghdad."}, {"label": "D", "text": "No, Mecca and Medina were never political centers to begin with."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What issue arose from the lack of a clear line of succession to the Abbasid caliphate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All men from the Abbasid family were eligible, encouraging a constant power struggle at court."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Different families wanted to rule, leading to outright war."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The people of Baghdad had to remember the names of all the children of the caliph, because anyone of them might become the next caliph."}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

All three have been defaced, some in ways that are almost impossible\nto see with the naked eye. Can you guess how they've been altered? You might be surprised. When a museum curator \ninspected this portrait, attributed to the 16th century \nItalian painter Bronzino, they suspected it was a modern fake. However, closely examining the cracks\non its surface, an art conservator discovered\nthat it was from that era— It had just undergone drastic changes\nin recent centuries. Using x-ray technology, they peered \nunder the outer surface of paint and saw the countenance \nof a completely different woman. Essential parts of the painting\nhad been modified during a 19th century restoration. Prior to the mid-20th century, art restorers took a more\nheavy-handed approach, often believing they were improving art. Nowadays, they focus on keeping\nthe original work intact with minimal intervention. When they need to fix something up, they usually make their markings visually\nand chemically distinct from the original, so they can be harmlessly removed. But the work of past restorers is a threat\nthey regularly contend with— as was the case with this portrait. To recover the original, the conservator began removing\nthe outer varnish coat. Varnish is commonly used to protect\npaintings from debris and make their colors pop. But the natural varnishes past restorers\napplied eventually darkened, which is what gives older paintings \nthat aged, yellowy look. Slowly dissolving the varnish, the conservator uncovered\ncrisp colors below. Taking small samples from the added\nand original paint layers, they analyzed the compositions of each. Then, they decided which solvents\ncould dissolve the overpainting while minimally affecting the original. Carefully dabbing the canvas with them, they removed the overpainting’s \ndainty hands and idealized face. The true painting underneath revealed\nIsabella of the Italian Medici dynasty. The portrait isn’t Bronzino’s, but it is from around 1570,\nand may have been painted by one of his students. Its Victorian makeover was likely done\nto boost sales because the original subject wasn’t\nconsidered attractive. But now, Isabella is back, \nmeeting her viewer’s gaze directly. This painting, \n“An Allegory with Venus and Cupid,” is actually Bronzino’s, \nand it was completed around 1545. It centers on a kiss between Venus\nand her son Cupid– but it’s been subtly altered. When London’s National Gallery\nacquired it in 1860, the Gallery’s director deemed it \ntoo risqué for Victorian England. So, he commissioned a restorer to obscure\nVenus’s tongue and nipple. A century after this modification, art conservators analyzed and removed\nthe overpainting with select solvents. In the process, they also realized \nthat the veil covering Venus’s crotch and the branch hiding Cupid’s posterior\nwere other add-ons. Removing two layers of censorship\nfrom the painting, it was finally free to boast\nits provocative original details. This massive painting called \n“The Night Watch” was completed by Rembrandt in 1642. Since then, it’s endured one\ndramatic amputation, two stabbings, an acid attack, and centuries of grime. A museum guard immediately neutralized\nthe acid with water. Restorers lifted the grime, revealing that the painting was\nnot set at night, and healed the slashes using adhesive\nand extra canvas backing. But they faced an even trickier problem. In 1715, strips were removed\nfrom all sides of the canvas, including two whole feet from the left,\nto fit it inside Amsterdam’s Town Hall. They've been lost ever since. But a multi-year conservation project that began in 2019 \nreplaced the missing pieces. They managed this by training\nan artificial intelligence to digitally paint in Rembrandt’s style. Then, using another artist’s rendering\nof the original, the program recreated and printed\nthe painting’s lost sections. Finally, the team returned \n“The Night Watch” to its full size, with AI-generated best guesses\nto fill in the blanks. All of these paintings had been altered,\nbut none of them were irrevocably ruined. With painstaking scientific analysis\nand technical skill, art conservators immortalize\npriceless artifacts. They counteract sudden damage\nand creeping threats— and sometimes, they perform near miracles. This video was made possible with support\nfrom Marriott Hotels.

This period gave rise to several regional\nlanguages in the area that's now Spain, including Castilian, Catalan and Galician. One of these would become Spanish—\nbut not for another 1,500 years. Those years tell the origin story \nof what’s become a global modern language. During the Roman occupation, colloquial spoken Latin, \noften called “Vulgar Latin,” mixed with Indigenous languages. Approximately 75% of modern Spanish comes\nfrom Latin, including syntactic rules. For instance, verbs are conjugated\nin a similar way as in Latin. And like other Roman languages, \nnouns have gender: el sol, the sun, is masculine, \nwhereas la luna, the moon, is feminine. After the Roman Empire collapsed, a series of other powers conquered \nthe region. First came the Visigoths starting \nin the 5th century of the common era. They spoke an eastern Germanic language that would eventually become \npart of German and lent a few words to the language\nthat would become Spanish. Then the Umayyad Caliphate\nousted the Visigoths. They spoke Arabic, which left \na strong mark on modern Spanish: over a thousand words come from Arabic. These often have a starting \n“a” or “z” sound, and sometimes include an “h.” In 1492, the Catholic Church consolidated\nits power through two monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, expelling Muslims and Jews, combining the distinct regional kingdoms\ninto one nation, and adopting one of the local languages \nas the official state language. That language was Castellano,\nor Castilian, from the Kingdom of Castile, which was centrally located in Spain\nand home to Madrid. Thereafter Castellano became Español,\nor Spanish. But the Spanish of 1492 was Old Spanish,\nvery different from Spanish today. That same year, Christopher Columbus\nsailed across the Atlantic Ocean, marking the start of the Spanish conquest\nof the Americas. The Indigenous population of the Americas spoke an estimated \n2,000 different languages. Over the next few decades, most of them were forced to adopt Spanish\nat the expense of their own languages. Still, words from Indigenous languages\nbecame part of Spanish. From Nahuatl, \nthe language of the Aztec Empire, came words with “ch” and “y”\nlike “chapulin” and “coyote.” From Quechua, \na language spoken in the Peruvian Andes, came words with “ch”\nlike “cancha,” “chullo,” and “poncho.” Some of these words describe things that hadn’t existed in the Spanish lexicon\nbefore, while others replaced existing\nSpanish words even in Spain. By the time Miguel de Cervantes published\nthe first part of “Don Quixote” in 1605, the language was arguably more similar \nto modern Spanish than plays of one of his contemporaries, \nWilliam Shakespeare, were to modern English. Starting in the 18th century, French language and culture were\nextremely fashionable in Spain, and later Hispanic America. While the two languages already had\ncommonalities from their shared roots in Latin, Spanish gained new words from French\nduring this period. In the 19th century, \nall over Central and South America, people revolted to gain independence \nfrom Spain. In the newly sovereign nations, people continued to speak the language\nof their former oppressors. Today, there are approximately 415 million\ninhabitants of Hispanic America. Spanish is the official language \nof 21 countries and Puerto Rico. As of 2021, only English, Mandarin,\nand Hindi have more speakers. How does a language with so many\nspeakers around the world not break apart into new languages\nthe way Vulgar Latin did? There's no easy answer to this question. Other languages that spread \nthrough colonialism, like French, have mixed with Indigenous languages \nto form entirely new ones. Some would argue that Spanglish,\na mixture of Spanish and English, is a distinct language \nor on its way to becoming one. But although a person in Buenos Aires\noccasionally might use words that aren’t fully intelligible to someone\nin Bogotá or Mexico City, Spanish retains enough unity \nof syntax, grammar, and vocabulary to remain one language."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In what region of the Iberian Peninsula did Spanish originate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Catalonia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Valencia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Castilla"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Basque Country"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What happened in 1492?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Galileo proposed that the earth is round"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Spanish language arrived in the Americas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Marco Polo met Queen Isabella"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Shakespeare visited Barcelona"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who composed the Spanish-language masterpiece Don Quixote of la Mancha?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Maradonna"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gabriel García Márquez"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Miguel de Cervantes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What characterizes the Spanish spoken in the Americas?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It mixes elements of indigenous, African, and immigrant languages"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is identical to the one used in Madrid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is similar to French"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It has no standardized spelling"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

People couldn't activate their smartphones\nwhile wearing gloves, so they began wielding snack sausages— causing one company to see \na 40% rise in sausage sales. So, what could sausages do\nthat gloves couldn’t? In other words, \nhow do touchscreens actually work? In 1965, the first ever touchscreen \nwas invented to help British air traffic controllers\nefficiently update flight plans. However, the technology was too unwieldy\nand expensive for widespread use. Over the following decades, engineers further developed\nthis technology and experimented with alternative\nkinds of touchscreens. Soon, resistive touchscreens\ndominated the market. But then, in 2007, Apple released\nthe first iPhone. It was a breakthrough, yet it functioned\nusing the same principle as the first touchscreen: capacitance. Nowadays, capacitive and resistive \ntouchscreens are two of the most common types. Both use an external input \nto complete their electric circuits. In conductive materials, \nelectrons flow around atoms, forming an electric current. In contrast to insulators, the electrons in conductors are\nweakly bound and flow easily. A resistive touchscreen has two layers. The top is a clear, flexible material—\nusually plastic— while the bottom is something rigid,\nlike glass. These layers are coated \nwith a conductive substance and separated by a thin gap. When something pushes\nhard enough, the layers connect, completing the electric circuit. This causes a change in voltage \nthat the machine’s software reacts to. Resistive touchscreens can\nbe a little unresponsive, but they're generally cheap and durable, so they're favored for industrial\nor mass use. A vast majority of the touchscreens\nproduced in 2007 were resistive. But in the years following \nthe iPhone’s release, most became capacitive. Individual models vary, \nbut smartphone touchscreens today typically consist of a protective, \ninsulating glass exterior and an LCD screen at the bottom \nthat produces the images you see. Between the glass exterior \nand the LCD screen are several sheets. One is lined with rows of a transparent,\nconductive material that carry an alternating \nelectric current. A thin insulating layer separates these\nconductive lines from others that are arranged as columns. One on top of the other, \nthe lines form a grid. The points where they intersect\nare called nodes. The phone's battery draws electrons\nalong the first layer of lines, and some electrons accumulate \nat every node, creating a small electric field. These screens are called \ncapacitive touchscreens because the nodes act like capacitors\nby storing charge. They’re generally easier to use\nthan resistive touchscreens because they interact directly with your\nfinger without the application of force. Your body is a great conductor and is\nconstantly transmitting electric currents. Why? Because about 60% of you is water. Now, while chemically pure water \nis an insulator, most water is impure. The water inside you is loaded with ions— atoms or molecules that have\na net electrical charge. So when you click on an app, your finger\nfunctions like a third electrical line. It interacts with the existing\nelectric field, which induces a weak electric current\nthat travels through your finger and eventually back into the phone. This changes the amount of charge\nat the affected nodes. And voltage measurements along\nthe second layer of lines tell the phone’s microprocessor which\npart of the screen is being touched. However, if you try using a smartphone\nwhile your hands are wet or gloved, you'll probably have some trouble. Both interrupt the electrical connection\nbetween your finger and phone. If water is splashed across the screen,\nit might trigger many underlying nodes, and the phone could act like you’ve \ntouched it in multiple places at once. On the other hand, gloves are insulators,\nso the charge has nowhere to go. Meanwhile, objects that conduct\nelectricity about as well as your finger— like banana peels \nand certain processed meats— can all activate the screen— knowledge that can come in clutch,\nwhen you’re in a pickle."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following couldn’t be used to operate an iPhone screen?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A banana "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Snack sausages "}, {"label": "C", "text": "A gloved finger "}, {"label": "D", "text": "A bare finger "}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What kind of touchscreen is used in the iPhone?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Resistive "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Capacitive "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Infrared "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gesture-based "}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How is the circuit completed in a resistive touchscreen?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "External force pushes two layers coated in conductive material together "}, {"label": "B", "text": "A current moves through an external conductor, like your finger "}, {"label": "C", "text": "A current reflects off your finer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An internal force is generated in the touchscreen, after you touch it with your finger"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the role of a capacitor?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To cap the topmost layer of a touchscreen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To connect two conductors "}, {"label": "C", "text": "To dispel an electric charge "}, {"label": "D", "text": "To store an electric charge "}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why is your finger a good conductor?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Your body is full of impure water, loaded with ions that can conduct an electrical charge "}, {"label": "B", "text": "A finger can push hard against a relatively inflexible surface "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Skin is an effective insulator "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Your body is full of high purity, polar water molecules"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Sliding a metal strip over a wooden stake, a master summoner is sending deep croaking\nnoises reverberating through the area. And, as if in a trance, hundreds of earthworms \nbegin emerging from the soil. This is worm grunting, also called\nworm charming or fiddling. It’s a tradition that’s been practiced\nfor more than a century, but its inner workings were \na mystery until only recently. Worms collectively undertaking\nan underground exodus seems especially unbelievable when you\nconsider how vulnerable this makes them. So why is surfacing worth the risk? Over the years, people have proposed\na number of imaginative hypotheses. One was that worms were somehow\ncharmed by the noise, like the rats from the medieval\nPied Piper legend. Okay, sounds fun, but how would \nthe worms actually become bewitched? Another hypothesis was that worm grunting\ntickled their bodies, so they emerged to end the aggravation. Whimsical! But worm grunting vibrates\nthe ground’s surface. If worms were evading the vibrations,\nwouldn't they burrow deeper instead? Perhaps the most popular hypothesis was\nthat worm grunting mimicked falling rain and the worms fled to avoid drowning. In 2008, biologist Kenneth Catania\ntested this hypothesis, setting up three arenas filled with soil and 300 individuals of the large species \nof earthworm found in the Florida Panhandle. After an hour of rain, \nwater had pooled at the surface, but only two earthworms emerged. The rest remained buried and healthy. So, unlike those containers, \nthis hypothesis just didn’t hold water. Catania decided to explore\nanother route of inquiry. In 1881, Charles Darwin published\nhis final work, a bestseller that rivaled his\nmost well-known books at the time: “The Formation of Vegetable Mould,\nThrough the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits.” Yes, it was literally called that— and it was the culmination of 40 years\nof earthworm investigations. Within it, Darwin noted that worms\nsometimes left their burrows when the ground trembled \nand mentioned an interesting hypothesis: maybe they flee because they believe\nthey’re being pursued by moles. Catania got to work testing\nthis hypothesis himself. He found that Eastern moles had\nastounding tracking abilities, could eat their weight in worms every day, and were abundant \nin the Florida Panhandle. When Catania released a single mole \ninto worm- and soil-filled arenas, about 30% of the worms crawled \nto the surface in the first hour— a markedly different result \nfrom the control and rain trials. And when he recorded \nthe vibrations produced by worm grunters and moles digging, their frequencies \noverlapped substantially. This was it. Over hundreds of thousands of years, these earthworms evolved a behavior\nthat helped them escape a top predator. Aboveground, they were immune\nto the moles, which usually stayed subterranean. But then humans came along. And, funnily enough, we aren’t even\nthe only ones that take advantage of this behavior. Herring gulls and wood turtles also \nsometimes drum their feet on the earth to summon worms. So then why does this behavior persist? Scientists think it’s beneficial \nfor a prey species to maintain its adaptations \nagainst a more frequent predator, even if it makes it more vulnerable \nto a rarer one. Many insects, for example, \nuse flight to avoid predation. But painted redstarts take\nadvantage of this: they boldly flash their colorful tail \nand wing feathers to elicit this response, then catch the insects \nas they try to fly away. It seems the prey species’ response \nremains simply because it’s beneficial \nmost of the time. For over a century, humans\nin the southern US, the UK, and elsewhere have been unknowingly exploiting \nthe worm’s escape response. The current world record \nfor “most worms charmed” was set by a 10-year-old \nBritish girl in 2009. Wiggling a fork in the ground \nand hitting it with a stick, she made 567 worms surface \nin just 30 minutes.

{"page": 107, "lesson": 6, "title": "The true cost of gold - Lyla Latif", "category": "Business & Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-true-cost-of-gold-lyla-latif", "transcript": {"en": "Gold is one of Earth’s most\nvaluable resources, with one kilogram regularly valued\nat over 55,000 US dollars. In 2020, Mali produced an estimated\n71.2 tons of gold. But Mali only saw $850 million \nfrom gold in 2020, when that amount is worth billions, not to mention that the country likely \nproduced much more than the reported 71.2 tons. The situation isn’t unique: a number of other gold-rich countries\nin Africa, including Mauritania, Senegal, Guinea, \nCote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Niger also aren’t seeing the income they should,\ngiven the price of gold. The force behind this is greed on an individual, corporate, \nand national scale, and a corrupt system \nthat perpetuates itself. Although Mali has abundant gold, the country lacks the infrastructure\nto mine and export it. So the government allows multinational\ncorporations to apply for licenses to mine gold in exchange\nfor taxes paid to Mali’s government. These taxes should, theoretically,\nfinance development, like building the infrastructure \nto mine gold, improve the economy, and provide citizens with public goods\nlike healthcare and education. Tax money alone isn’t enough\nto do these things, of course: a government also has to be invested \nin its people’s well-being, and government corruption\ncan prevent progress. But without adequate funds, even the best intentioned government \ndoesn’t stand a chance of improving circumstances \nfor its citizens. Foreign corporations exploit \nMali’s need for tax revenue to get the government to sign on to very\nunfavorable yet perfectly legal contracts. For example, one such contract stated \nthat no corporate taxes would be owed for the first five years, \ncosting Mali millions in tax revenue. Meanwhile, mining licenses sometimes allow\nthese corporations to take samples of gold out of the country \nwithout registering them or paying taxes on them. These should be small amounts of gold \nused to test for quality, but the license doesn’t limit\nthe size of samples, so this creates a loophole where corporations export large\namounts of gold without paying any tax. The multinational corporations are \nalso evading taxes they are legally required to pay. They filter profits through a labyrinth \nof tax havens that’s difficult to trace. Or they exaggerate their expenses \nso they end up owing very little in taxes. For instance, a corporation in Mali uses\na subsidiary in Ireland to manage its operations\nand another subsidiary in the Netherlands to license its brand name. The corporation in Mali pays \nmanagement fees to the Irish subsidiary and pays intellectual property license\nfees to the Dutch company, all for enormous sums. These costs are deducted \nfrom overall profits, leaving the amount subject \nto taxes at a bare minimum. These companies also buy gold\non the black market. Local, small-scale miners often operate\nwithout a license, so the government is unaware\nof how much gold they mine. Corporations buy gold from these miners, avoiding the cost of mining \nthe gold themselves, and pay the miners far below market value. Then they turn around and tell\nthe government they incurred huge expenses \nmining gold they didn’t mine at all. There’s no way for Mali’s revenue \nauthority to verify this information, causing the country to lose\neven more tax money. Similarly, corporations pay corrupt\ngovernment officials to help them smuggle gold across borders,\nprimarily to the United Arab Emirates, rather than operating \nthrough legal channels. In 2016, Mali reported around $200 million\nof exported gold, but the UAE reported receiving slightly\nover $1.5 billion of imported gold from Mali that same year. The gold is then sold to European, \nAmerican, and Asian markets from the UAE, with no questions asked about its origins. Similar patterns can be seen \nwith gold-rich countries across Africa, indicating that gold smuggling \nis happening on a massive scale, without ever being subject to taxes. All of this creates a vicious cycle, forcing a continued reliance on the corporations that helped create\nthe situation in the first place. More than half of Mali’s citizens live \nbelow the international poverty line, while their nation’s wealth lines\nthe pockets of foreign corporations and corrupt officials."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The government of Mali permits foreign companies to apply for gold mining licenses in exchange for ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Machinery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Taxes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Technology"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Some mining contracts contain unfavorable terms, such as no corporate tax for the first ___ years.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "7"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Some mining companies are involved in gold smuggling across borders, usually through ___.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Burkina Faso"}, {"label": "B", "text": "London"}, {"label": "C", "text": "United Arab Emirates"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nairobi"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In 2016, Mali reported that approximately ___ million dollars’ worth of gold of was exported to UAE.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1500"}, {"label": "B", "text": "200"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "250"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "One of tricks mining companies use to falsify and inflate their mining related expenses is to buy gold from ___ then record expenses to give an impression that the gold was mined by the company.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Local, small-scale miners"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Government officers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Smugglers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The UAE"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

The alert went all the way\nto the president, who was deciding whether to strike back when another system contradicted\nthe initial warning. What they thought was the first missile\nin a massive attack was actually a research rocket\nstudying the Northern Lights. This incident happened \nafter the end of the Cold War, but was nevertheless one of the closest\ncalls we’ve had to igniting a global nuclear war. With the invention of the atomic bomb, humanity gained the power to destroy\nitself for the first time in our history. Since then, our existential risk— risk of either extinction or the unrecoverable collapse \nof human civilization— has steadily increased. It’s well within our power\nto reduce this risk, but in order to do so, we have to understand which \nof our activities pose existential threats now, \nand which might in the future. So far, our species has survived\n2,000 centuries, each with some extinction risk\nfrom natural causes— asteroid impacts, supervolcanoes,\nand the like. Assessing existential risk is \nan inherently uncertain business because usually when we try to figure out\nhow likely something is, we check how often it's happened before. But the complete destruction of humanity\nhas never happened before. While there’s no perfect method to\ndetermine our risk from natural threats, experts estimate it’s about \n1 in 10,000 per century. Nuclear weapons were our first\naddition to that baseline. While there are many risks associated\nwith nuclear weapons, the existential risk comes\nfrom the possibility of a global nuclear war that leads\nto a nuclear winter, where soot from burning cities\nblocks out the sun for years, causing the crops that humanity\ndepends on to fail. We haven't had a nuclear war yet, but our track record is too short to tell\nif they’re inherently unlikely or we’ve simply been lucky. We also can’t say for sure whether a global nuclear war\nwould cause a nuclear winter so severe it would pose an existential threat\nto humanity. The next major addition to our existential\nrisk was climate change. Like nuclear war, \nclimate change could result in a lot of terrible scenarios \nthat we should be working hard to avoid, but that would stop short of causing\nextinction or unrecoverable collapse. We expect a few degrees\nCelsius of warming, but can’t yet completely \nrule out 6 or even 10 degrees, which would cause a calamity of possibly\nunprecedented proportions. Even in this worst-case scenario, it’s not clear whether warming would pose\na direct existential risk, but the disruption it would cause\nwould likely make us more vulnerable to other existential risks. The greatest risks may come \nfrom technologies that are still emerging. Take engineered pandemics. The biggest catastrophes in human history\nhave been from pandemics. And biotechnology is enabling\nus to modify and create germs that could be much more deadly\nthan naturally occurring ones. Such germs could cause pandemics \nthrough biowarfare and research accidents. Decreased costs of genome sequencing\nand modification, along with increased availability\nof potentially dangerous information like the published genomes \nof deadly viruses, also increase the number of people\nand groups who could potentially create\nsuch pathogens. Another concern is unaligned AI. Most AI researchers think this will be\nthe century where we develop artificial intelligence\nthat surpasses human abilities across the board. If we cede this advantage, we place\nour future in the hands of the systems we create. Even if created solely with humanity’s \nbest interests in mind, superintelligent AI could pose \nan existential risk if it isn’t perfectly aligned \nwith human values— a task scientists are finding\nextremely difficult. Based on what we know at this point, some experts estimate the anthropogenic\nexistential risk is more than 100 times higher \nthan the background rate of natural risk. But these odds depend heavily\non human choices. Because most of the risk is from human\naction, and it’s within human control. If we treat safeguarding humanity's future\nas the defining issue of our time, we can reduce this risk. Whether humanity fulfils its potential— or not— is in our hands."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which event was the first anthropogenic existential risk to humanity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The invention of the atomic bomb"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The beginning of the industrial revolution"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Cold War"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Climate Change"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are some examples of possible existential threats to humanity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nuclear weapons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Climate Change"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A large asteroid hitting Earth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why does nuclear war pose an existential risk?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It can accelerate climate change by warming up the Earth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It can lead to more illnesses and global pandemics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It might cause a severe nuclear winter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are some examples of technologies that can pose existential risks?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bioweapons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Research accidents"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unaligned artificial intelligence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both A and C are correct"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What type of existential risk is more likely to occur in our lifetime?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "anthropogenic existential risk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "natural existential risk"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Some tend to be especially prevalent,\nlike Lactobacilli. These bacteria produce an acid \nthat lowers the vagina’s pH, limiting what can survive there and\npreventing against certain infections. Candida yeasts are also usually present\nin small quantities. Most of the time, \nthese fungi are harmless. The body’s immune system keeps them \nin check while other microorganisms, like Lactobacilli, combat and outcompete\nthem for nutrients and territory. But under certain conditions, \nCandida yeasts can cause infections. One species in particular,\ncalled Candida albicans, is the usual culprit of vaginal thrush\nor yeast infections, which affect 3 out of every 4 people \nwith a vagina. So, how exactly does a yeast\ninfection happen? Candida albicans yeasts are shapeshifters. And when the balance within the vagina\nis disrupted— like the pH increases or there are \nfewer microbes to compete with— Candida albicans may assume \ntheir disease-causing forms. They multiply and metamorphose— substituting their rounded structures for elongated thread-like forms \ncalled hyphae. Then, they secrete enzymes that degrade\nthe epithelial cells lining the vagina and permeate the tissue. Immune cells rush to the site, generating some of the most recognizable\nsymptoms of yeast infections: itching, burning, swelling, and redness. These may also be accompanied\nby a change in vaginal discharge, the fluid that’s frequently flushed from\nthe vagina to keep it healthy and clean. During a yeast infection,\ndischarge may become thicker and whiter because the vagina is shedding \nmore epithelial and Candida cells. A few major factors, like \nantibiotic treatments and lower immunity, can make people more susceptible \nto vaginal yeast infections. When someone’s immune system is\ncompromised, from illness or otherwise, their body may be unable to control\nCandida effectively. And in treating bacterial infections,\nantibiotics kill harmful bacteria, but they can also wipe out beneficial \nones, like Lactobacilli, allowing Candida to multiply more easily. Many other factors also help set\nthe stage for yeast infections. Hormonal changes and diet alter\nthe vaginal microbiome. Semen is relatively basic, \nso it can disrupt the vagina’s pH. Tight, non-breathable, and wet garments\nincubate moisture and are thought to facilitate\na more Candida-friendly environment. Soaps can damage the protective\nmucus that coats the vagina, making it easier for Candida to permeate. That’s why many doctors recommend\njust gently washing the vulva with water. And it’s important to wipe \nfrom front to back to avoid introducing more Candida as well \nas other potentially harmful microbes to the vagina. Most yeast infections are mild \nand clear up within two weeks. Antifungal medications usually offer\ndependable treatments by reducing the number of Candida cells, allowing the immune system and \nother microorganisms to regain control. And interestingly, the solution \nto treating some yeast infections could be more yeasts. Preliminary studies with probiotics \ncontaining the harmless yeasts we use in brewing and baking have shown \npromise in keeping Candida in check while reducing inflammation. But some yeast infections\nrequire more extensive therapies. About 5 to 10% of people with vaginas experience at least 4 yeast infections \na year. For some of those, \nthe cause seems to be genetic. Some people have gene variants that make\nit harder for their immune systems to recognize and regulate Candida cells. But why many others have recurrent\ninfections is currently unclear— and requires a lot more research. In fact, so does basically everything\nwe've just talked about. We don’t know nearly enough \nabout the vaginal microbiome. This is probably because of stigma\nand underfunding when it comes to topics that traditionally\nfall under the umbrella of “women’s health.” For instance, while erectile dysfunction\naffects a much smaller percentage of people than vaginal yeast infections, there’s about 6 times more\nresearch on the subject. Hopefully, we’ll soon have\na better understanding of the many microorganismal multitudes \nwe contain— and how best to keep them in balance."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which type of bacteria are most prevalent in the human vagina?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Escherichia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lactobacillus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bifidobacterium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gardnerella"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What do we call the thread-like form Candida albicans adopts to penetrate epithelial cells?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yeast cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chlamydospores"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hyphae"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Opaque cells"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many people experience at least four fungal vaginal infections each year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2-5%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5-10%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10-20%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20-50%"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why can antibiotics cause fungal infections?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they lower the pH"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because they cause a hormonal imbalance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because they damage the protective mucus layer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because they kill the natural competitors of the fungi"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Some genetic determinants increase frequencies of fungal infections.

Those contents happened to be thousands\nof kilograms of live hagfish, also known as slime eels. The result of this 2017 car accident \nwas an absolute mess: the highway was littered \nwith wriggling fish and coated in a thick slime that took \nthe fire department 7 hours to clear. Astonishingly good looks aside, the standout strength of all hagfishes\nis their slime. In fact, they’re probably \nEarth’s slimiest animals. But why be so slimy? Watch and learn. This hagfish has detected a dead fish\nusing its keen sense of smell and the tastebud-like organs \ndotting its skin. Revealing imposing rows of toothlike\nstructures, it takes the first bite. A shark glides on to the scene\nand suddenly lunges. Being caught in the shark’s powerful jaws\nmay seem like a guaranteed death sentence, but the hagfish has some tricks \nup its sleeve. The shark’s teeth clench down\nbut there are no bones to crush— only flexible cartilage. And because the hagfish’s skin is so \nloosely attached to the rest of its body, the pressure from the bite causes the hagfish’s essential organs\nto slip out of the way, avoiding damage. This is where being a noodle \nin a baggy wetsuit really pays off. Meanwhile, the hagfish also actively\nrepels the shark by spewing a stupendous supply of slime. Around a hundred slime glands\nline each side of the hagfish’s body. Within them are mucus and thread cells. The mucus cells are packed with hundreds\nof vesicles of condensed mucus while each thread cell contains \nan intricately coiled protein fiber. The hagfish contracts the muscles\nsurrounding some of its slime glands, causing the cells to eject their contents\ninto the seawater. In a fraction of a second, \nthe mucus vesicles swell and burst, and the protein fibers unravel. Together, they expand to 10,000 times\ntheir original volume, instantly creating liters of slime. Because the substance is composed of mucus and reinforced with numerous superfine \nand strong silk-like fibers, the slime is incredibly soft yet tough. It lodges in the shark’s delicate gills, and as the shark chokes \nand tries to clear the slime, it releases the hagfish. Now, the hagfish is free \nfrom the jaws of death. But it’s in a dilemma of its own doing, trapped in a cloud of its own\nsuffocating slime. So what does it do? Well, it ties itself in a knot, of course. Starting at its tail \nand passing its body through, the hagfish effectively wipes away\nits own slime. Apparently unfazed by the whole encounter, it returns to its meal. When it gets to a tougher part \nof the carcass... Voila! The hagfish ties itself \nin yet another knot to gain leverage and yank off the meat. The hagfish’s slime is so remarkable\nthat people are trying to emulate it. Currently, a lot of athletic \nand safety gear is made from non-renewable\npetroleum-based fibers. But hagfish slime threads rival \nthe properties of materials like nylon. And fibers modeled after those \nin hagfish slime may present a much more sustainable alternative. Meanwhile, hagfish slime is also being \nexplored in military contexts as a non-lethal weapon that could be used\nto stop boats by sliming up their propellers. In addition to mastering\nthe art of slime and knot-tying, hagfish have four little hearts and can survive 36 hours \nwithout oxygen unscathed. Oh, and they also clean the seafloor and cycle essential nutrients \nin the deep sea. Proto-hagfish were navigating\nthe ocean’s depths more than 300 million years ago— before dinosaurs roamed \nand back when Pangea was still a thing.

Is it the one with the best food?\nThe longest life expectancy? The best weather? For the past 70 years, most governments \nhave relied heavily on a single number to answer that question. This number influences elections, \nthe stock market, and government policy. But it was never intended\nfor its current purpose; and some would argue that the world \nis addicted to making it grow... forever. This number is called \nthe Gross Domestic Product, or GDP, and it was invented by the economist\nSimon Kuznets in the 1930s, to try and gauge the size of an economy\nin a single, easy to understand number. GDP is the total monetary value \nof everything a country produces and sells on the market. To this day, GDP per capita, which is just the total GDP divided by the\nnumber of people living in that country, is widely seen as a measure of well-being. But GDP doesn’t actually say anything\ndirect about well-being, because it doesn't take into account\nwhat a country produces or who has access to it. A million dollars of weapons contributes \nthe exact same amount to a country’s GDP as a million dollars of vaccines or food. The value society derives from things\nlike public school or firefighters isn’t counted in GDP at all, because those\nservices aren’t sold on the market. And if a country has a lot of wealth, but most of it is controlled\nby relatively few people, GDP per capita gives a distorted picture\nof how much money a typical person has. Despite all that, for a long time, higher GDP did correlate closely\nto a higher quality of life for people in many countries. From 1945 to 1970, as GDP doubled,\ntripled or even quadrupled in some western economies, people’s wages often grew proportionally. By the 1980s, this changed. Countries continued to grow richer, but wages stopped keeping pace \nwith GDP growth, or in some cases, even declined, and most of the benefits went to an \never-smaller percentage of the population. Still, the idea of capturing\na nation’s well-being in a single number had powerful appeal. In 1972, King Jigme Singye Wangchuk\nof Bhutan came up with the idea \nof Gross National Happiness as an alternative \nto Gross Domestic Product. Gross National Happiness is a metric \nthat factors in matters like health, education, \nstrong communities, and living standards, having citizens answer questions like, “How happy do you think your family\nmembers are at the moment?” “What is your knowledge of names of plants\nand wild animals in your area?” and “What type of day was yesterday?” The United Nations’ Human Development\nIndex is a more widely used metric; it takes into account health\nand education, as well as income per capita \nto estimate overall well-being. Meanwhile, a metric called\nthe Sustainable Development Index factors in both well-being and the \nenvironmental burdens of economic growth, again, boiling all this down\nto a single number. Though no country has been able to meet the basic needs of its people while also using resources \nfully sustainably, Costa Rica currently comes the closest. Over the past few decades, it’s managed to grow its economy\nand improve living standards substantially without drastically increasing \nits emissions. Other countries,\nlike Colombia and Jordan, have made notable progress. Costa Rica now has better well-being\noutcomes like life expectancy than some of the world’s \nrichest countries. Ultimately, there are limits \nto any approach that boils the quality of life in a country \ndown to a single number. Increasingly, experts favor a dashboard\napproach that lays out all the factors a single number obscures. This approach makes even more sense given \nthat people have different priorities, and the answer to which country \nis best to live in depends on who’s asking the question. So what if that were you designing \nyour countries well-being metric?

So what can happen to our bodies \nin just one month that allows us to endure\nthis incredible altitude? Let’s imagine you’re one \nof the 5.8 billion people living less than 500 meters \nabove sea level.

And if you ascend to altitudes\nabove 2,500 meters, the resulting oxygen deprivation can cause\na form of altitude sickness known as AMS, often causing headaches,\nfatigue and nausea. Fortunately, AMS only happens\nwhen we ascend too fast, because our bodies have numerous ways\nof adapting to high altitudes. Within minutes or even seconds \nof reaching altitudes of 1,500 meters, carotid chemoreceptors in your neck\nsense your blood’s low oxygen pressure. This triggers a response that increases \nthe rate and depth of your breathing to counteract the lack of oxygen. Your heart rate also increases and your heart contracts more tightly \nto pump additional blood with each beat, quickly moving oxygenated\nblood around your body. All these changes happen relatively fast,\nand if you were to keep ascending, your heart rate and breathing\nwould speed up accordingly. But if you stayed at this altitude\nfor several weeks, you could reap the benefits \nof some longer-term adaptations. Within the first few days \nabove 1,500 meters, the volume of plasma \nin your blood decreases, which increases the concentration\nof hemoglobin. Over the next two weeks, your hemoglobin\nlevels will continue to rise, allowing your blood to carry \neven more oxygen per milliliter. Paired with your high heart rate, this new hemoglobin-rich blood efficiently\ndistributes oxygen throughout your body. So much so that the volume of blood \nbeing pumped with each heartbeat can return to normal levels. Over this same time, your breathing \nalso increases even further in a process called \nventilatory acclimatization. After this several weeks \nof extended acclimatization, your body has made enough significant\nchanges to climb even higher. However, you’ll still have to spend\nadditional time acclimating along the way, often climbing back down to recover \nbefore ascending even higher. Because the summit of Everest\nisn't just high, it’s the highest place on Earth. And at altitudes above 3,500 meters, \nour bodies are under incredible stress. Arteries and veins in the brain\ndilate to speed up blood flow, But our smallest blood vessels,\ncalled capillaries, remain the same size. This increased pressure can cause\nblood vessels to leak, and fluid to build up in the brain. A similar issue can occur in the lungs, where low oxygen causes blood vessels \nto constrict, leading to more leaking vessels\nand fluid buildup. These two conditions— \nknown as HACE and HAPE, respectively— are incredibly rare, but can be life-threatening \nif not dealt with quickly. Some Tibetans and South Americans \nwith family histories of living at high altitude have genetic advantages that can \nprevent minor altitude sickness, but even they aren’t immune\nto these severe conditions. Yet despite these risks, \nclimbers over the last century have proved people can go higher \nthan scientists ever thought possible. Pushing past their body’s limitations, these climbers have redefined\nwhat humanity can adapt to."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "At the summit of Mount Everest, the barometric pressure is ____% of what it is at sea level?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "11"}, {"label": "B", "text": "22"}, {"label": "C", "text": "33"}, {"label": "D", "text": "44"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Acute mountain sickness can cause which following symptoms:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Headache"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nausea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fatigue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Low blood oxygen is sensed by the carotid body which results in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An increase in breathing rate and depth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A decrease in breathing rate and depth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An increase in red blood cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A decrease in red blood cells"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After several weeks of living at high altitude your hemoglobin levels are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Reduced, making more room for oxygen to bind"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increased, allowing your blood to carry more oxygen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unchanged, because your heart is beating faster"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Excessively high pressures inside of blood vessels in the lungs can lead to what high altitude illness?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "HACE – High altitude cerebral edema"}, {"label": "B", "text": "AMS – Acute mountain sickness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "CMS – Chronic mountain sickness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "HAPE – High altitude pulmonary edema"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

british museum it's the world's largest world history museum and it draws millions of visitors every year inside it holds more than eight million cultural and historical artifacts from all over the world which cover 2 million years of human history if you follow the museum's recommended list of don't miss items you'll see its star pieces like this easter island sculpture that's about a thousand years old or this bronze sculpture of the hindu god shiva [Music] but there's a problem hidden in the museum and we can see an example of it along this route out of those 12 pieces nearly half have disputed ownership the british museum claims those pieces belong there on display for the world to see but in recent years many have been fighting to get them back to where they came from the list of disputed museum treasures keeps on growing should cultural artifacts return to their home countries or be left in western museums the subject of intense debate as to who should now own them let's start with some context in the late 1600s the british empire began expanding across several continents it became the largest empire in history controlling about a quarter of the world's land and population during its centuries-long role the empire took precious resources and wealth from countries all over the world including cultural and historical artifacts many of which ended up here in the british museum which was founded in 1753 and kept growing to accommodate all the new pieces in its collection lots of the items in the museum were legally acquired and are completely undisputed like this one a two thousand year old roman base sold to the museum by a duke in 1945. the problem is with the pieces that are disputed like the first item you see as soon as you walk in the rosetta stone taken by british troops from the french in what is now egypt or further in the parthenon sculptures removed from the acropolis in athens by a british lord and sent to the british museum or over here on the floor dedicated to african art the benin bronzes some of the most contentious items in the museum the benin bronzes are kind of hard to categorize because they include such a huge range of items from engraved ivory tusks to brass sculptures to plaques but they were all produced here in the kingdom of benin in present-day nigeria this wealthy and industrious kingdom produced thousands of objects and art pieces starting in the 1500s a lot of the items adorned palace walls and were used for religious rituals but they weren't just decorative there were visual archives of the kingdom in a society that did not develop a written script as we know them that's professor chika okekeyagulu an art historian and professor from nigeria who teaches at princeton university they told their history how they narrated the histories of kingship of the kingdom its political and social life but in 1897 benin would lose thousands of these cultural pieces at the time european colonial powers were expanding south in what was called the scramble for africa they split up the continent into spheres of influence for financial exploitation all these pink areas were the british ones benin over here was in britain's sphere of influence but the kingdom didn't comply with britain's trade demands and in january of 1897 it led to what was called the benin disaster where benin guards killed seven british emissaries plus their many guides and servants in response 1 200 british troops embarked on a mission called the benin punitive expedition the british wanted revenge but the mission was about more than just that there were reports of these vast treasures in the palace of the king of the name and that if they could retrieve these treasures sales from it could offset the cost of the invasion this was all well planned and so the punitive expedition in other words was also an economic enterprise the british soldiers armed with machine guns conquered the city and burned it to the ground but not before carefully taking thousands of artifacts they piled them up neatly photographed them and even labeled them loot this photo taken at the benin palace after the raid shows soldiers with the dismantled plaques that were brought to the british museum and sold all over the world and after hundreds of years the once prosperous kingdom was gone the region fell under full british colonial control until 1960 when nigeria including the city of benin gained independence but even though they were finally free their historical artifacts were still spread all over the world locked up in western institutions like the leipzig museum of ethnology in germany and the que brandle museum in paris and of course the british museum [Music] 1995 in london that was my first time of seeing an original uh ancient benin artwork was yes at the british museum being in the presence of these magnificent objects and knowing that i had to travel all the way from nigeria to see for the first time in these objects it was a mixture of pride in the achievement of these ancient artists and and mixed with a sense of loss at what could have been if i only had to travel a few hundred miles but at this point you're limited to those uh privileged like me who could get a visa to travel all the way from nigeria to england um to encounter these objects most nigerians will never see them [Music] in march 2000 benin's royal family tried to change that they officially requested all cultural property illegally taken be returned to the rightful owner but for the most part the british museum has ignored any requests the museum is restricted by a government act that prevents it from returning objects but it has also made its stance clear in july of 2020 the british museum told vox we don't restitute but we are absolutely committed to lending as widely as possible including to nigeria the museum's foundational value resides in its breadth scale complexity and unity and as such is a true library of the world chica doesn't see it that way the british museum still behaves like a colonial museum you cannot claim to be an encyclopedic collector of stolen objects but some are starting to reckon with this history in 2014 the grandson of this british soldier from the 1897 benin punitive expedition returned these two items he had inherited to the benin royal family and in 2007 the benin dialogue group was formed western museums that hold the bronzes and nigerian government representatives have been discussing potential solutions ever since but as of today none of the bronzes have been returned but this is just one story this legacy is bigger than the bannon bronzes there are hundreds of contested items in the british museum with their own rich histories and with original owners trying to retrieve them but the problem is even bigger than the british museum it's a legacy of centuries of colonial power that repeats itself again and again with different artifacts in different museums because these requests aren't just about items they are also about cultural and historical identity and who gets to own it this is a long term project it may last beyond my own lifetime but the point is that it's now to start that process we cannot wait any longer for a next generation to even begin the necessary task and project of cultural [Music] reconstitution [Music]

{"page": 107, "lesson": 13, "title": "Why can parrots talk? - Grace Smith-Vidaurre and Tim Wright", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-can-parrots-talk-grace-smith-vidaurre-and-tim-wright", "transcript": {"en": "In 2010, a parrot that spoke \nwith the same British accent as his owner went missing. They were reunited four years later, but the intervening time left\na conspicuous mark: the parrot had lost its British accent and was instead chattering\naway in Spanish. Parrots and several other birds are\nthe only other animals that produce human speech. And some parrots do it almost \nuncannily well. How is this possible? Most wild parrots are highly social. They use vocalizations for mating\nand territorial displays and to coordinate group movements. Some species have flocks \nthat continuously split and fuse, meaning individual parrots must be able\nto communicate with many others. Parrots use contact calls to interact and stay in touch when others\nare out of sight. But how exactly they use these calls\ndepends on the species and the size of their flocks. Monk parakeets, for example,\nlive in large colonies and have individualized contact calls \nthat help them stand out. Yellow-naped Amazon parrots, \non the other hand, forage in smaller groups that learn\nand share highly similar contact calls. This need for sophisticated mimicry may\npartially explain why yellow-naped Amazons and some other parrots can \nclosely imitate a wide range of sounds— including the human voice. So, how does a parrot actually declare\nthat “Polly wants a cracker”? A person would string these sounds\ntogether using their larynx, the organ at the top of their windpipe. It consists of rings of muscles \nand a vibrating membrane that controls airflow. They’d finely shape the vocalization \ninto enunciated words using their tongue and lips. For a parrot, however, the sound\nwould originate in its syrinx, located at the base of its windpipe. Many other birds have two vibrating\nmembranes within this organ. But parrots, like us, have just one. As sounds leave the airway, parrots shape\nthem using their tongues and beaks. They can do this because they have\nespecially flexible, powerful tongues that help them manipulate seeds and nuts. And while parrots’ beaks are rigid, \nthey have very flexible jaw joints, giving them a lot of control\nover how wide and how quickly they open their beaks. Like other animals \nwith learned vocalizations, parrot brains contain interconnected\nregions that allow them to hear, remember, modify, \nand produce complex sounds. But while songbirds have just one\nsong system in their brains, almost all parrots seem to have\nan additional circuit. Scientists think that this might give \nthem extra flexibility when it comes to learning the calls \nof their own species— and ours. With this specialized anatomy, parrots can bark, scream, curse, \nand recite factoids. One intrepid lost parrot managed \nto get back home after repeating his full name \nand address to helpful strangers. But these impressive abilities \nraise another question: do parrots actually understand \nwhat they’re saying? When most captive parrots talk, they’re likely attempting to form social\nbonds in the absence of their own species. Many probably have associations\nwith words and may be drawn to ones \nthat elicit certain responses— hence their capacity for profanity. But, especially after training, parrots have been observed to say things\nin the appropriate contexts and assign meaning to words— \nsaying “goodnight” at the end of the day, asking for certain treats, \nor counting and picking objects. One extensively trained \nAfrican grey parrot named Alex became the first non-human animal \nto pose an existential question when he asked what color he was. Whether they’re belting Beyoncé,\nhead-banging to classic rock, or rattling off cuss words at zoo-goers, parrots are constantly astounding us—\nas they have been for millennia. But our fascination with parrots has\nalso made them vulnerable. Sought by poachers and pet traders, while losing their habitats\nto deforestation, wild populations have decreased\ndramatically. To truly understand parrots, we need \nto preserve and study them in the wild."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Captive parrots can mimic human words from different languages.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Parrots use ________ to stay in touch with their social companions as individuals leave and rejoin social groups.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Alarm calls"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Feathers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Contact calls"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wingbeats"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Parrots vocalize using their syrinx, part of the vocal tract that has __________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A single vibrating membrane, similar to humans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two vibrating membranes, just like songbirds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A ring-like arrangement of feathers that vibrate to produce sounds"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The parrot brain contains one neural circuit linked to vocal mimicry.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True.
