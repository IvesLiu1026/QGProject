Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features \nlooping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly\nstolen from a dream. Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces\naccompany the text. This 24x16 centimeter book\nis called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest\nunsolved mysteries. The reason why? No one can figure out what it says. The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across\nthe document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. He was puzzled. Who wrote it? Where was it made? What do these bizarre words\nand vibrant drawings represent? What secrets do its pages contain? He purchased the manuscript from\nthe cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle\nover it for more than a century. Cryptologists say the writing has all\nthe characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. What makes it seem real is that\nin actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear\nwith consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find\nfrom a random letter generator. Other than that, we know little more\nthan what we can see. The letters are varied \nin style and height. Some are borrowed from other scripts,\nbut many are unique. The taller letters have been named\ngallows characters. The manuscript is \nhighly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. It appears to be written by two\nor more hands, with the painting done \nby yet another party. Over the years, three main theories\nabout the manuscript's text have emerged. The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed\nto hide secret meaning. The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money\noff a gullible buyer. Some speculate the author\nwas a medieval con man. Others, that it was Voynich himself. The third theory is that the manuscript\nis written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting\nto create an alphabet for a language that was spoken\nbut not yet written. In that case, the Voynich manuscript\nmight be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture\nthat made it collapsed. Though no one can read \nthe Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing\nwhat it might say. Those who believe the manuscript\nwas an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge \nof the culture that produced it. Others believe it was written by \nthe 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand \nthe universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the\nElizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. More fringe theories that the book was\nwritten by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little\nlight on the mystery. The first breakthrough \nwas the carbon dating. Also, contemporary historians have\ntraced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague\nto as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed\nfrom Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. In addition to these \nhistorical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed\nthe provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. Could the letters beside these seven\nstars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven\nstars called the Pleiades? Could this word be Centaurun\nfor the Centaurea plant in the picture? Perhaps, but progress is slow. If we can crack its code,\nwhat might we find? The dream journal of \na 15th-century illustrator? A bunch of nonsense? Or the lost knowledge \nof a forgotten culture?

{"page": 32, "lesson": 2, "title": "What you can do to prevent Alzheimer's | Lisa Genova", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/JbufIwmt", "transcript": {"en": "How many people here would like to live\nto be at least 80 years old? Yeah. I think we all have\nthis hopeful expectation of living into old age. Let's project out into the future, to your future \"you's,\" and let's imagine that we're all 85. Now, everyone look at two people. One of you probably has\nAlzheimer's disease. (Laughter) Alright, alright. And maybe you're thinking,\n\"Well, it won't be me.\" Then, OK. You are a caregiver. So -- (Laughter) so in some way, this terrifying disease\nis likely to affect us all. Part of the fear around Alzheimer's\nstems from the sense that there's nothing we can do about it. Despite decades of research, we still\nhave no disease-modifying treatment and no cure. So if we're lucky enough\nto live long enough, Alzheimer's appears to be\nour brain's destiny. But maybe it doesn't have to be. What if I told you we could\nchange these statistics, literally change our brain's destiny, without relying on a cure\nor advancements in medicine? Let's begin by looking at\nwhat we currently understand about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's. Here's a picture\nof two neurons connecting. The point of connection,\nthis space circled in red, is called the synapse. The synapse is where\nneurotransmitters are released. This is where signals are transmitted,\nwhere communication happens. This is where we think,\nfeel, see, hear, desire ... and remember. And the synapse\nis where Alzheimer's happens. Let's zoom in on the synapse and look at a cartoon representation\nof what's going on. During the business\nof communicating information, in addition to releasing neurotransmitters\nlike glutamate into the synapse, neurons also release a small peptide\ncalled amyloid beta. Normally, amyloid beta is cleared away\nmetabolized by microglia, the janitor cells of our brains. While the molecular causes\nof Alzheimer's are still debated, most neuroscientists believe\nthat the disease begins when amyloid beta begins to accumulate. Too much is released,\nor not enough is cleared away, and the synapse begins\nto pile up with amyloid beta. And when this happens, it binds to itself, forming sticky aggregates\ncalled amyloid plaques. How many people here\nare 40 years old or older? You're afraid to admit it now. This initial step into the disease, this presence of amyloid\nplaques accumulating, can already be found in your brains. The only way we could be sure of this\nwould be through a PET scan, because at this point,\nyou are blissfully unaware. You're not showing any impairments\nin memory, language, or cognition ... yet. We think it takes at least 15 to 20 years\nof amyloid plaque accumulation before it reaches a tipping point, then triggering a molecular cascade that causes the clinical\nsymptoms of the disease. Prior to the tipping point, your lapses in memory\nmight include things like, \"Why did I come in this room?\" or \"Oh ... what's his name?\" or \"Where did I put my keys?\" Now, before you all\nstart freaking out again, because I know half of you did at least\none of those in the last 24 hours -- these are all normal kinds of forgetting. In fact, I would argue that these examples might not even involve your memory, because you didn't pay attention\nto where you put your keys in the first place. After the tipping point, the glitches in memory,\nlanguage and cognition are different. Instead of eventually finding\nyour keys in your coat pocket or on the table by the door, you find them in the refrigerator, or you find them and you think, \"What are these for?\" So what happens when amyloid plaques\naccumulate to this tipping point? Our microglia janitor cells\nbecome hyper-activated, releasing chemicals that cause\ninflammation and cellular damage. We think they might actually\nstart clearing away the synapses themselves. A crucial neural transport protein\ncalled \"tau\" becomes hyperphosphorylated and twists itself\ninto something called \"tangles,\" which choke off the neurons\nfrom the inside. By mid-stage Alzheimer's,\nwe have massive inflammation and tangles and all-out war at the synapse and cell death. So if you were a scientist\ntrying to cure this disease, at what point would you ideally\nwant to intervene? Many scientists are betting big\non the simplest solution: keep amyloid plaques\nfrom reaching that tipping point, which means that drug discovery is largely\nfocused on developing a compound that will prevent, eliminate, or reduce\namyloid plaque accumulation. So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely be\na preventative medicine. We're going to have to take this pill\nbefore we reach that tipping point, before the cascade is triggered, before we start leaving\nour keys in the refrigerator. We think this is why, to date,\nthese kinds of drugs have failed in clinical trials -- not because the science wasn't sound, but because the people in these trials\nwere already symptomatic. It was too late. Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match. At the tipping point, the match\nsets fire to the forest. Once the forest is ablaze, it doesn't do any good\nto blow out the match. You have to blow out the match\nbefore the forest catches fire. Even before scientists sort this out, this information is actually\nreally good news for us, because it turns out that the way we live\ncan influence the accumulation of amyloid plaques. And so there are things we can do to keep us from reaching\nthat tipping point. Let's picture your risk\nof Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale. We're going to pile\nrisk factors on one arm, and when that arm hits the floor,\nyou are symptomatic and diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Let's imagine you're 50 years old. You're not a spring chicken anymore, so you've accumulated\nsome amyloid plaques with age. Your scale is tipped a little bit. Now let's look at your DNA. We've all inherited our genes\nfrom our moms and our dads. Some of these genes will increase our risk\nand some will decrease it. If you're like Alice in \"Still Alice,\" you've inherited a rare genetic mutation\nthat cranks out amyloid beta, and this alone will tip\nyour scale arm to the ground. But for most of us, the genes we inherit\nwill only tip the arm a bit. For example, APOE4 is a gene variant\nthat increases amyloid, but you can inherit a copy of APOE4\nfrom mom and dad and still never get Alzheimer's, which means that for most of us, our DNA alone does not determine\nwhether we get Alzheimer's. So what does? We can't do anything about getting older\nor the genes we've inherited. So far, we haven't changed\nour brain's destiny. What about sleep? In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cells\nrinse cerebral spinal fluid throughout our brains, clearing away metabolic waste\nthat accumulated in our synapses while we were awake. Deep sleep is like\na power cleanse for the brain. But what happens if you shortchange\nyourself on sleep? Many scientists believe that poor sleep hygiene might actually\nbe a predictor of Alzheimer's. A single night of sleep deprivation\nleads to an increase in amyloid beta. And amyloid accumulation\nhas been shown to disrupt sleep, which in turn causes\nmore amyloid to accumulate. And so now we have\nthis positive feedback loop that's going to accelerate\nthe tipping of that scale. What else? Cardiovascular health. High blood pressure, diabetes,\nobesity, smoking, high cholesterol, have all been shown to increase our risk\nof developing Alzheimer's. Some autopsy studies have shown that as many as 80 percent\nof people with Alzheimer's also had cardiovascular disease. Aerobic exercise has been shown\nin many studies to decrease amyloid beta in animal models of the disease. So a heart-healthy\nMediterranean lifestyle and diet can help to counter\nthe tipping of this scale. So there are many things we can do to prevent or delay\nthe onset of Alzheimer's. But let's say\nyou haven't done any of them. Let's say you're 65; there's Alzheimer's in your family,\nso you've likely inherited a gene or two that tips your scale arm a bit; you've been burning the candle\nat both ends for years; you love bacon; and you don't run unless\nsomeone's chasing you. (Laughter) Let's imagine that your amyloid plaques\nhave reached that tipping point. Your scale arm has crashed to the floor. You've tripped the cascade, setting fire to the forest, causing inflammation, tangles,\nand cell death. You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's. You should be having trouble\nfinding words and keys and remembering what I said\nat the beginning of this talk. But you might not be. There's one more thing you can do\nto protect yourself from experiencing\nthe symptoms of Alzheimer's, even if you have the full-blown disease\npathology ablaze in your brain. It has to do with neural plasticity\nand cognitive reserve. Remember, the experience\nof having Alzheimer's is ultimately a result of losing synapses. The average brain has\nover a hundred trillion synapses, which is fantastic;\nwe've got a lot to work with. And this isn't a static number. We gain and lose synapses all the time, through a process\ncalled neural plasticity. Every time we learn something new, we are creating and strengthening\nnew neural connections, new synapses. In the Nun Study, 678 nuns, all over the age of 75\nwhen the study began, were followed for more than two decades. They were regularly given\nphysical checkups and cognitive tests, and when they died, their brains\nwere all donated for autopsy. In some of these brains, scientists\ndiscovered something surprising. Despite the presence of plaques\nand tangles and brain shrinkage -- what appeared to be\nunquestionable Alzheimer's -- the nuns who had belonged\nto these brains showed no signs of having the disease\nwhile they were alive. How can this be? We think it's because these nuns\nhad a high level of cognitive reserve, which is a way of saying that they had\nmore functional synapses. People who have more years\nof formal education, who have a high degree of literacy, who engage regularly\nin mentally stimulating activities, all have more cognitive reserve. They have an abundance\nand a redundancy in neural connections. So even if they have a disease\nlike Alzheimer's compromising some of their synapses, they've got many extra backup connections, and this buffers them from noticing\nthat anything is amiss. Let's imagine a simplified example. Let's say you only know one thing\nabout a subject. Let's say it's about me. You know that Lisa Genova\nwrote \"Still Alice,\" and that's the only thing\nyou know about me. You have that single neural connection, that one synapse. Now imagine you have Alzheimer's. You have plaques and tangles\nand inflammation and microglia devouring that synapse. Now when someone asks you,\n\"Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'\" you can't remember, because that synapse\nis either failing or gone. You've forgotten me forever. But what if you had learned more about me? Let's say you learned\nfour things about me. Now imagine you have Alzheimer's, and three of those synapses\nare damaged or destroyed. You still have a way\nto detour the wreckage. You can still remember my name. So we can be resilient\nto the presence of Alzheimer's pathology through the recruitment\nof yet-undamaged pathways. And we create these pathways,\nthis cognitive reserve, by learning new things. Ideally, we want these new things\nto be as rich in meaning as possible, recruiting sight and sound\nand associations and emotion. So this really doesn't mean\ndoing crossword puzzles. You don't want to simply retrieve\ninformation you've already learned, because this is like traveling\ndown old, familiar streets, cruising neighborhoods you already know. You want to pave new neural roads. Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain means learning to speak Italian, meeting new friends, reading a book, or listening to a great TED Talk. And if, despite all of this, you are\nsomeday diagnosed with Alzheimer's, there are three lessons I've learned\nfrom my grandmother and the dozens of people I've come to know\nliving with this disease. Diagnosis doesn't mean\nyou're dying tomorrow. Keep living. You won't lose your emotional memory. You'll still be able\nto understand love and joy. You might not remember\nwhat I said five minutes ago, but you'll remember how I made you feel. And you are more than what\nyou can remember. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Not much. So why are both known as goths? Is it a weird coincidence or a deeper connection stretching \nacross the centuries? The story begins in Ancient Rome. As the Roman Empire expanded,\nit faced raids and invasions from the semi-nomadic populations \nalong its borders. Among the most powerful were\na Germanic people known as Goths who were composed of two tribal groups, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths. While some of the Germanic tribes\nremained Rome's enemies, the Empire incorporated others\ninto the imperial army. As the Roman Empire split in two, these tribal armies played\nlarger roles in its defense and internal power struggles. In the 5th century, a mercenary revolt\nlead by a soldier named Odoacer captured Rome \nand deposed the Western Emperor. Odoacer and his Ostrogoth\nsuccessor Theoderic technically remained under the Eastern\nEmperor's authority and maintained Roman traditions. But the Western Empire would never\nbe united again. Its dominions fragmented into kingdoms\nruled by Goths and other Germanic tribes who assimilated into local cultures, though many of their names\nstill mark the map. This was the end of the Classical Period and the beginning of what many call\nthe Dark Ages. Although Roman culture was never\nfully lost, its influence declined\nand new art styles arose focused on religious symbolism\nand allegory rather than proportion and realism. This shift extended to architecture with the construction of the Abbey\nof Saint Denis in France in 1137. Pointed arches, flying buttresses,\nand large windows made the structure more skeletal\nand ornate. That emphasized its open, \nluminous interior rather than the sturdy walls\nand columns of Classical buildings. Over the next few centuries, this became a model for Cathedrals\nthroughout Europe. But fashions change. With the Italian Renaissance's renewed\nadmiration for Ancient Greece and Rome, the more recent style began to seem\ncrude and inferior in comparison. Writing in his 1550 book, \n\"Lives of the Artists,\" Giorgio Vasari was the first\nto describe it as Gothic, a derogatory reference to the Barbarians thought to have destroyed \nClassical civilization. The name stuck, and soon came\nto describe the Medieval period overall, with its associations of darkness,\nsuperstition, and simplicity. But time marched on,\nas did what was considered fashionable. In the 1700s, a period called\nthe Enlightenment came about, which valued scientific reason \nabove all else. Reacting against that, Romantic authors\nlike Goethe and Byron sought idealized visions of a past\nof natural landscapes and mysterious spiritual forces. Here, the word Gothic \nwas repurposed again to describe a literary genre that\nemerged as a darker strain of Romanticism. The term was first applied \nby Horace Walpole to his own 1764 novel, \n\"The Castle of Otranto\" as a reference to the plot \nand general atmosphere. Many of the novel's elements became\ngenre staples inspiring classics and the countless\nmovies they spawned. The gothic label belonged to literature\nand film until the 1970s when a new musical scene emerged. Taking cues from artists like\nThe Doors and The Velvet Underground, British post-punk groups, like Joy Division, Bauhaus, and The Cure, combined gloomy lyrics \nand punk dissonance with imagery inspired \nby the Victorian era, classic horror, and androgynous glam fashion. By the early 1980s, similar bands\nwere consistently described as Gothic rock by the music press, and the stye's popularity brought it\nout of dimly lit clubs to major labels and MTV. And today, despite occasional negative\nmedia attention and stereotypes, Gothic music and fashion continue as\na strong underground phenomenon. They've also branched into sub-genres, such as cybergoth, gothabilly, gothic metal, and even steampunk. The history of the word gothic is embedded in thousands of years \nworth of countercultural movements, from invading outsiders becoming kings to towering spires \nreplacing solid columns to artists finding beauty in darkness. Each step has seen a revolution of sorts and a tendency for civilization to reach into\nits past to reshape its present."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Gothic Music emerged out of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Disco"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Punk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Blues"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Classical"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The 5th century soldier who deposed the Western Emperor was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Theodoric"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bauhaus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Odoacer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vasari"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Abbey of St. Denis was built in 1137 in:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "France"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germany"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "England"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The term “gothic” was first used as a derogatory term during the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Romantic Age"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Renaissance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Classical Age"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dark Ages"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The first use of the term “gothic” in relation to literature was in reference to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mary Shelley’s \"Frankenstein\""}, {"label": "B", "text": "Goethe’s \"Faust\""}, {"label": "C", "text": "Horace Walpole’s \"The Castle of Otranto\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bram Stoker’s \"Dracula\""}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Gothic music emerged out of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Disco"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Punk"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Blues"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Classical"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 32, "lesson": 4, "title": "How to Find Fulfilling Work", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/eUPskL0s", "transcript": {"en": "The idea that work might be fulfilling, rather than just painfully necessary, is a strikingly recent invention. Open Dr. Johnson's celebrated dictionary, published in 1755, and the word fulfillment doesn't even appear. Nowadays in a prosperous world, we don't only expect to obtain money through our labor, we also, to a greater or lesser extent, expect to find meaning and satisfaction. It's a big ask and helps to explain why so many of us have career crises often on a Sunday evening as the Sun begins to set. To help us on the quest for fulfilling work here are six useful ideas: Firstly, accept the being confused about careers is perfectly normal. In a pre-industrial world there were, at most, some 2,000 different trades out there; nowadays there' are estimated to be half a million different options. The result: we can become so anxious about making the wrong choice, we end up making no choice at all; psychologists call this \"the paradox of choice\", paralysis stemming from too many options. We should acknowledge that confusion is natural, and fear entirely normal; but let neither of these scupper our chances forever. Secondly, know yourself. It's the oldest philosophical recommendation, and has particular relevance to careers. For 99% of us knowing what we want to do doesn't arise spontaneously; like for example, knowing what to eat. Most of us don't have a calling; we don't hear a commanding god like voice directing us to accountancy, or packaging and distribution. That isn't to say we don't have taste or inclinations, we just don't know them clearly enough, which is a perilous position to be in, as not having a plan quickly puts us at the mercy of those who do have one. We only catch glimpses, little hints of our tastes. So what we have to do is learn to pick up on their faint sounds: start by parking any concerns for money for a time; financial panic too often kills all dialogue with the more authentic, passionate sides of one's nature. Write down, without being too logical or analytical about it, everything you've ever enjoyed doing or making, which might include building a tree-house, or sorting out the winter clothes. The weirder and more offbeat list, the better. In the long and confused tangle that follows there will, somewhere, be the shape of an ideal future working self, but it'll be very messed up, and in need of being analyzed thoroughly That's where philosophy comes in; Philosophy is the art clearing up, and demanding logic of our first thoughts. Thirdly, think a lot. If it might take a couple of days, even a week, to choose a new car, it could, fairly, take a year or more of sustained daily reflection to start to identify a career that fits. We tend to feel guilty about this: imagining we're being self-indulgent-far from it; we may need to empty every weekend for months to sort out the biggest conundrum of our lives. To make sure we don't continue to spend the rest of our lives trapped in a job unwittingly chosen for us by our unknowing 16 year old selves, we need to be properly generous about the amount of time we'll need to give this. Fourthly, try something It's tempting to imagine we'll be able to work out the shape of the workplace, and of our own characters simply through pure process of reflection, but we need data, and we can only understand ourselves and others by colliding with the real world, in the process getting to know both it and our own natures. We need to take small, non-irrevocable steps to gather information, for example by: shadowing, interning, or volunteering. We mustn't think we always have to resign on Monday; we can investigate our futures through branching projects on the side of existing jobs. Five, reflect on what makes people unhappy. Every successful business is at heart an attempt to solve someone else's problem; the bigger and more urgent problem, the greater the opportunity. To flex your entrepreneurial muscles, consider an average day and everything in it that might make someone unhappy: from losing the house keys, to finding the food a little greasy, to arguing yet again with their spouse. Each of these is a business opportunity waiting to be exploited; it's a chance for us to serve, which is what work really is. It's easy to imagine that everything's been done and tried- nonsense; we're unhappy enough for capitalism to have many more centuries of invention and creativity to it. Six, be confident. So many bad self help books are about confidence; it can be tempting to dismiss the whole topic as nonsense; but in a peculiar and rather humbling way, it really does seem as if the difference between success and failure is sometimes nothing less than the courage to give it a go. The ability to imagine oneself into a role, to surmise one doesn't need to ask anyone for permission that many of the top positions simply belong to those who dare to boldly ask for them. A lack of confidence is at heart a misunderstanding of the way the world works; it's an internalized feudalism which imagines that only certain people but not oneself, have the right, preordained, to get certain things. It isn't true. As we know, a lot more is possible than we might think at our moments of timidity  and doubt. That's a start of the path towards a job we won't regret on our death beds, which should always be the ultimate criterion."}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 32, "lesson": 5, "title": "How does your body process medicine? - Céline Valéry", "category": "Consumer Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-your-body-process-medicine-celine-valery", "transcript": {"en": "Have you ever wondered what\nhappens to a painkiller, like ibuprofen, after you swallow it? Medicine that slides down\nyour throat can help treat a headache, a sore back, or a throbbing sprained ankle. But how does it get where it needs\nto go in the first place? The answer is that it hitches\na ride in your circulatory blood stream, cycling through your body in a race\nto do its job before it's snared by organs\nand molecules designed to neutralize and expel foreign substances. This process starts \nin your digestive system. Say you swallow an ibuprofen tablet\nfor a sore ankle. Within minutes, the tablet starts\ndisintegrating in the acidic fluids of your stomach. The dissolved ibuprofen travels\ninto the small intestine and then across the intestinal wall\ninto a network of blood vessels. These blood vessels feed into a vein, which carries the blood,\nand anything in it, to the liver. The next step is to make \nit through the liver. As the blood and the drug molecules\nin it travel through liver blood vessels, enzymes attempt to react with \nthe ibuprofen molecules to neutralize them. The damaged ibuprofen molecules,\ncalled metabolites, may no longer be effective as painkillers. At this stage, most of the ibuprofen\nmakes it through the liver unscathed. It continues its journey out of the liver, through veins, into the body's circulatory system. Half an hour after you swallow the pill, some of the dose has already made it\ninto the circulatory blood stream. This blood loop travels through every\nlimb and organ, including the heart, brain, kidneys,\nand back through the liver. When ibuprofen molecules \nencounter a location where the body's pain \nresponse is in full swing, they bind to specific target molecules\nthat are a part of that reaction. Painkillers, like ibuprofen, block the\nproduction of compounds that help the body transmit pain signals. As more drug molecules accumulate, the pain-cancelling affect increases, reaching a maximum within about\none or two hours. Then the body starts efficiently \neliminating ibuprofen, with the blood dose decreasing by half\nevery two hours on average. When the ibuprofen molecules detach\nfrom their targets, the systemic blood stream carries\nthem away again. Back in the liver, another small fraction\nof the total amount of the drug gets transformed into metabolites, which are eventually filtered out\nby the kidneys in the urine. The loop from liver to body to kidneys\ncontinues at a rate of about one blood cycle per minute, with a little more of the drug neutralized\nand filtered out in each cycle. These basic steps are the same for\nany drug that you take orally, but the speed of the process and the amount of medicine that makes\nit into your blood stream varies based on drug, person, and how it gets into the body. The dosing instructions \non medicine labels can help, but they're averages based on \na sample population that doesn't represent every consumer. And getting the dose right is important. If it's too low, \nthe medicine won't do its job. If it's too high, the drug \nand its metabolites can be toxic. That's true of any drug. One of the hardest groups of patients\nto get the right dosage for are children. That's because how they process medicine\nchanges quickly, as do their bodies. For instance, the level of liver enzymes\nthat neutralize medication highly fluctuates \nduring infancy and childhood. And that's just one \nof many complicating factors. Genetics, age, diet, disease, and even pregnancy influence the body's\nefficiency of processing medicine. Some day, routine DNA tests may be able\nto dial in the precise dose of medicine personalized to your liver efficiency\nand other factors, but in the meantime, your best bet is reading the label or consulting your doctor\nor pharmacist, and taking the recommended amounts\nwith the recommended timing."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A drug/medicine taken as a tablet can eventually treat any part of the body because it reaches the _________ that goes everywhere in the body.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Liver"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Systemic/circulatory bloodstream"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stomach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Small intestine"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The extent and speed of drug/medicine processing by the body varies with ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Age"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Genetics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Liver _________ react with drugs to transform them, so that they are easier to expel from the body.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Blood vessels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Enzymes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Walls"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "______ minutes after you have swallowed a tablet, some of the drug/medicine has already reached your bloodstream.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "30"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "One day, routine _____ tests may be available to finely tune the right dose of medicines for each patient.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "DNA"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Skin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Generic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Internet"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

It’s a frog that’s pretty bizarre but\nalso weirdly sweet and adorable. Sadly, it went extinct just before I was born,\nso I thought I’d never get the chance to see it. But a few years ago, scientists tried to bring\nit back from the dead. I’m Anna and this is Gross Science. Gastric-brooding frogs were first found in\nQueensland, Australia in 1972. They looked pretty normal—just your average\nbrownish, greenish frog. But there was nothing average about how they\ngave birth. A female frog would lay her eggs, and a male\nfrog would fertilize them externally. So far so normal. But then, the mother frog would swallow the\neggs—around 40 of them! You’d think this would be a terrible idea. After all, stomachs—whether they be frog\nor human—usually contain strong acid to break down your last meal. But the eggs likely contained a chemical that\nmade the mother’s stomach stop producing acid. That meant the mother couldn’t eat during\nher pregnancy, which from a human perspective seems awful, but the frogs seemed to make\ndo. Eventually, tadpoles would hatch from the\neggs. And the tadpoles would release mucus that\ncontained more of that acid-blocking chemical. The babies would continue to grow in the stomach\nfor another 6 weeks, getting so big that they’d compress the mother’s lungs. Luckily, these frogs could also breathe through\ntheir skin, so the mothers didn’t suffocate. Finally, the tadpoles would metamorphose into\nbaby frogs, and the mother would vomit them up—usually one at a time over a few days. Though, when provoked some were known to projectile\nvomit all their babies out at once. While barfing up your babies sounds...horrible...it’s\nkinda sweet when you think about it. Gastric-brooding, as this strategy is called,\nis a way to keep your babies close to you and safe while they’re most vulnerable. It’s really a lot like human pregnancy…only\nthe babies come out the other end… Anyway, there were two species of these frogs,\nbut both went extinct by the mid-80s. The culprit was likely an invasive fungus—one\nthat poses a major threat to amphibians worldwide, and that humans likely helped to spread around\nthe globe. It’s called chytrid fungus and it affects\na frog’s skin. Because frogs use their skin for crucial functions\nlike breathing, staying hydrated, and regulating their temperature, the parasite can easily\nkill its victims. And it’s highly contagious—by 2013 it\nhad put 42% of the world’s frog species in danger. Losing all these frogs would be, in a word,\ndevastating. Not only would it have major impacts on ecosystems\nworldwide, and be a loss of beautiful biodiversity, but there is so much we still have to learn\nfrom these creatures that might be beneficial to human health and well-being. Take the gastric-brooding frog. If we’d had more time to study it, maybe\nwe could have learned more about how it turns off stomach acid production, potentially revealing\nsome insights that could help humans with GI problems. Consequently, back in 2013, some scientists\nbegan a project to resurrect the gastric-brooding frog. They took cells from a frozen specimen, cloned\nthe DNA into the egg of another frog species, and ended up creating a living gastric-brooding\nfrog embryo. It only survived for about three days, but\nthey haven’t given up trying. And it’s made some researchers hopeful that\n“de-extinction”—the process of bringing extinct species back to life—will one day\nbe a solution for reviving at least some of the valuable biodiversity we’ve lost, often\ndue to humans’ impact on the environment. Obviously, this is a controversial idea. And, I think most scientists would agree that\nde-extinction is a last-gasp effort in conservation. It in no way means we should stop protecting\nand preserving the at-risk species we have. That said, while I can’t speak to the ethics\nof the situation, I will admit that there’s a pretty big part of me that would love to\nsee a gastric-brooding frog vomiting up its babies.

{"page": 32, "lesson": 7, "title": "What is entropy? - Jeff Phillips", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-entropy-jeff-phillips", "transcript": {"en": "There's a concept that's crucial\nto chemistry and physics. It helps explain why physical processes\ngo one way and not the other: why ice melts, why cream spreads in coffee, why air leaks out of a punctured tire. It's entropy, and it's notoriously\ndifficult to wrap our heads around. Entropy is often described as\na measurement of disorder. That's a convenient image,\nbut it's unfortunately misleading. For example, which is more disordered - a cup of crushed ice or a glass\nof room temperature water? Most people would say the ice, but that actually has lower entropy. So here's another way of thinking\nabout it through probability. This may be trickier to understand,\nbut take the time to internalize it and you'll have a much better \nunderstanding of entropy. Consider two small solids which are comprised \nof six atomic bonds each. In this model, the energy in each solid\nis stored in the bonds. Those can be thought of \nas simple containers, which can hold indivisible units of energy\nknown as quanta. The more energy a solid has,\nthe hotter it is. It turns out that there are numerous\nways that the energy can be distributed in the two solids and still have the same \ntotal energy in each. Each of these options \nis called a microstate. For six quanta of energy in Solid A\nand two in Solid B, there are 9,702 microstates. Of course, there are other ways our eight\nquanta of energy can be arranged. For example, all of the energy\ncould be in Solid A and none in B, or half in A and half in B. If we assume that each microstate\nis equally likely, we can see that some of the energy\nconfigurations have a higher probability of occurring\nthan others. That's due to their greater number\nof microstates. Entropy is a direct measure of each\nenergy configuration's probability. What we see is that the energy\nconfiguration in which the energy\nis most spread out between the solids has the highest entropy. So in a general sense, entropy can be thought of as a measurement\nof this energy spread. Low entropy means \nthe energy is concentrated. High entropy means it's spread out. To see why entropy is useful for\nexplaining spontaneous processes, like hot objects cooling down, we need to look at a dynamic system\nwhere the energy moves. In reality, energy doesn't stay put. It continuously moves between \nneighboring bonds. As the energy moves, the energy configuration can change. Because of the distribution \nof microstates, there's a 21% chance that the system\nwill later be in the configuration in which the energy is maximally \nspread out, there's a 13% chance that it will\nreturn to its starting point, and an 8% chance that A will actually\ngain energy. Again, we see that because there are\nmore ways to have dispersed energy and high entropy than concentrated energy, the energy tends to spread out. That's why if you put a hot object\nnext to a cold one, the cold one will warm up\nand the hot one will cool down. But even in that example, there is an 8% chance that the hot object\nwould get hotter. Why doesn't this ever happen\nin real life? It's all about the size of the system. Our hypothetical solids only had\nsix bonds each. Let's scale the solids up to 6,000 bonds\nand 8,000 units of energy, and again start the system with\nthree-quarters of the energy in A and one-quarter in B. Now we find that chance of A\nspontaneously acquiring more energy is this tiny number. Familiar, everyday objects have many, many\ntimes more particles than this. The chance of a hot object \nin the real world getting hotter is so absurdly small, it just never happens. Ice melts, cream mixes in, and tires deflate because these states have more\ndispersed energy than the originals. There's no mysterious force\nnudging the system towards higher entropy. It's just that higher entropy is always\nstatistically more likely. That's why entropy has been called\ntime's arrow. If energy has the opportunity\nto spread out, it will."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A system must evolve toward an energy configuration where the energy is maximally spread out.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The likelihood that a system will evolve toward and energy configuration where the energy is maximally spread out is independent of the size of the system.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Given that energy configuration A has 11,460 microstates and energy configuration has 3,820 microstates, how does the probability of energy configuration A occurring compare to the probability of B occurring?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They’re equally likely"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is three times more likely"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is one-third less likely"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cannot be determined without additional information"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Systems move toward thermal equilibrium because, they move toward the energy configuration:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "That has the maximum number of microstates"}, {"label": "B", "text": "With the maximum entropy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "such that the energy is maximally spread out"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Entropy is often called “time’s arrow” because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Trying to understand entropy hurts as much as being struck by arrow"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Like other physical quantities such as velocity and force, entropy is a vector and therefore requires a direction (such as “north” or “down”) to be described completely"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Macroscopic processes evolve toward a specific energy configuration (two objects in thermal equilibrium, air escaped out of a leaky tire, etc.) and never evolve away from that configuration"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

How big do you think the group\nwould have to be before there's more than a 50% chance\nthat two people in the group have the same birthday? Assume for the sake of argument\nthat there are no twins, that every birthday is equally likely, and ignore leap years. Take a moment to think about it. The answer may seem surprisingly low. In a group of 23 people, there's a 50.73% chance that \ntwo people will share the same birthday. But with 365 days in a year, how's it possible that you need such\na small group to get even odds of a shared birthday? Why is our intuition so wrong? To figure out the answer, let's look at one way a mathematician might calculate \nthe odds of a birthday match. We can use a field of mathematics\nknown as combinatorics, which deals with the likelihoods\nof different combinations. The first step is to flip the problem. Trying to calculate the odds \nof a match directly is challenging because there are many ways you\ncould get a birthday match in a group. Instead, it's easier to calculate the odds\nthat everyone's birthday is different. How does that help? Either there's a birthday match\nin the group, or there isn't, so the odds of a match\nand the odds of no match must add up to 100%. That means we can find \nthe probability of a match by subtracting the probability\nof no match from 100. To calculate the odds of no match,\nstart small. Calculate the odds that just one pair\nof people have different birthdays. One day of the year will be\nPerson A's birthday, which leaves only 364 possible birthdays\nfor Person B. The probability of different birthdays\nfor A and B, or any pair of people, is 364 out of 365, about 0.997, or 99.7%, pretty high. Bring in Person C. The probability that she has \na unique birthday in this small group is 363 out of 365 because there are two birthdates\nalready accounted for by A and B. D's odds will be 362 out of 365,\nand so on, all the way down to W's odds\nof 343 out of 365. Multiply all of those terms together, and you'll get the probability\nthat no one shares a birthday. This works out to 0.4927, so there's a 49.27% chance that no one in\nthe group of 23 people shares a birthday. When we subtract that from 100,\nwe get a 50.73% chance of at least one birthday match, better than even odds. The key to such a high probability \nof a match in a relatively small group is the surprisingly large number\nof possible pairs. As a group grows, the number of possible \ncombinations gets bigger much faster. A group of five people \nhas ten possible pairs. Each of the five people can be paired\nwith any of the other four. Half of those combinations are redundant because pairing Person A with Person B\nis the same as pairing B with A, so we divide by two. By the same reasoning, a group of ten people has 45 pairs, and a group of 23 has 253. The number of pairs grows quadratically, meaning it's proportional to the square\nof the number of people in the group. Unfortunately, our brains \nare notoriously bad at intuitively grasping \nnon-linear functions. So it seems improbable at first that 23\npeople could produce 253 possible pairs. Once our brains accept that,\nthe birthday problem makes more sense. Every one of those 253 pairs is a chance\nfor a birthday match. For the same reason,\nin a group of 70 people, there are 2,415 possible pairs, and the probability that two people\nhave the same birthday is more than 99.9%. The birthday problem is just one example\nwhere math can show that things that seem impossible, like the same person winning\nthe lottery twice, actually aren't unlikely at all.

{"page": 32, "lesson": 10, "title": "Safe Cracking with Feynman - Numberphile", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/UCF8BQ3A", "transcript": {"en": "BRADY HARAN: Hey there,\neveryone. Today's video is about\nRichard Feynman-- a lot of people's favorite\nscientist-- and safe breaking. But I just wanted to point out\nat the start that most safes, or secure filing cabinets,\nactually have one dial. And if you've got a three\nnumber combination, for example, you'll turn that dial\nin one direction, then the other direction, and then back\nin the other direction. And that's how you open it. But the mock up that we've\nused in this video-- and it is a mock up,\nI can assure you. It's about as far from a\nsafe as you could get. We've used three dials. That kind of makes things a bit\nmore visual, a bit easier to understand looking\nat it in that way. But in most cases, the sort of\nsafes we're talking about will actually be using one dial. I don't want to get all the safe\nenthusiasts out there too fired up and angry in the\ncomments section. But for now, here's Professor\nBowley with his pretend safe and the story of Richard Feynman\nand his World War II safe cracking. PROFESSOR ROGER BOWLEY: I'm\ntalking about Feynman and how he managed to crack safes when\nhe was working on the atomic bomb project in Los Alamos\nin the early '40s. His wife had died. So early in the 1940s,\nhis wife died. And he was stuck in the\nmiddle of Los Alamos, not able to get out. It was a sort of desert\narea around there. He was stuck with lots of other\ntheoretical physicists. So he needed something\nfor amusement. And as a hobby, he tried\ncracking open all the safes in Los Alamos. Now, they had new, purpose built\nsafes with locks on them made by the Mosler\nlock company. You can imagine 100 numbers\nfor this, 100 numbers for that, 100 numbers for that-- a million, a million\npossible settings. And if you fiddle them around,\nit'll take about five seconds to do it. So if you tried to crack\nit, it will take you about 60 days. On the average, it'd be 30 days,\nbut 60 days if you screw up and it takes the last\none to open it. Well, Feynman was\na group leader. So he was given one of these in\nhis office to keep all the top secret files that he\nmight come up with. So he knew how this worked\nmechanically, because he fiddled around with it. He'd just fidget\nwith anything. He wanted to know\nhow it worked. And he found by trial and error,\nsuppose the number should be 20, it was set at. Actually, it started at 25,\nand a lot of people didn't change it from 25, naught, 25. That was the default. And if he wanted to crack the\nsafe, a lot of times, people left it in the default setting,\nbecause it's the easiest one to remember. Suppose he set it at 20. Now, he found that if he tried\nto set it at 20 and it opened, he could also set it to 21\nand it would open, or 22. There was some slack on this. This was not mechanically\nperfect. So there was a bit of tolerance,\nplus or minus 2 on every single number, which meant\nthat if you set it at 20, it could be 21 or\n22 or 19 or 18-- and the same for this dial and\nthe same for this dial. So now, if you go through all\nthe combinations, you only have to do 3, 8,\n13 and so on-- every fifth one-- to make sure you\ncover them all. Now, there are only 20 settings\nfor this, 20 for that, and 20 for that. So automatically, that's gone\ndown, oh, I can't do it. Can you do it in your\nhead, Brady? It's really quite difficult. 8,000 different settings-- now, that becomes doable\nmechanically. It will take you something\nlike 10 hours working solidly overnight. And you could do it. And he could do that. He worked out how to do it. He found out other ways\nof doing this. He found that most people\nwill set a birthday, an anniversary, some well-defined\ndate that-- I don't know, the Independence\nDay in the United States of America, whatever. And it would not be an ordinary\nnumber, because if it's going to be, say, my\nbirthday, which is the 21st of April if anybody wants\nto send me presents. There's the 21st. 04-- 04 is there. And I'm born in 1946,\nwhich is down there. So for the top one, which is the\ndays of the month, there are typically 30 days\nin a month. So let's suppose there are\njust 30 and never 31. 30 days in the month, you would\nneed to set it in six different positions. Now, for the months, there's 12\nmonths in the year, so you may need not two, but\nthree for that. So now, we've got six settings\nhere, three settings there. And for the year-- well, now, the year, if it's\nsome date, it's going to be something in the past. So how long back in the past\nis somewhat arbitrary. But suppose 45 would do,\nand then it would be 9. He was doing it 1942\nor '43 or '44. All right. So the test would be somewhere\naround there. So 45 is a natural number to\nlook at, because then you don't have to go back into\nthe previous century. 6 for this one, 3 for this\none, and 9 for that one. And you multiply\nthem together. And you get out 162. So that's 162 different\nsettings. Five seconds for each, 162-- that's 800 seconds. It's about 12 minutes. So he could go in and if\nsomebody had chosen one of those dates, instead of having\n8,000, he's got 162. And he can do it\nin 12 minutes. On the average, it will be six\nminutes, because he might be reach it in the first\ngo or he might reach it after 12 minutes. But he would only require\n12 minutes. So he would go in and make a\nbig fuss of going into the office and say, I'm not going\nto show the secrets. These are top secret stuff. I don't want everybody\nto know my secrets. And he'd carry in a bag with\ntools-- screwdrivers, picks, all sorts of things that people\nwould think you crack safes with-- shut the door, and in 12\nminutes, he would do it. He'd take a magazine\nin with him. Sometimes, he'd get it done\nstraight away and he'd do some exercise and wait for 20 minutes\njust to make everybody believe it was tough\nwork doing this. And then he'd come out with a\nbit of sweat on his brow, saying, that was hard work. So those were the main\ntechniques that he used. 162 means that this isn't safe\nand using your birthday or anniversary is not safe. But after that, he learned\nanother trick. And he got the number\ndown to 20. Out of all these million,\nthere were 20. And it turns out that if you\nopen the safe and leave it open, and there's a little\ndraw on the bottom. And he goes into somebody\nelse's office. He chats to them. And the safe is open. He fiddles with all the knobs. And after two years of practice,\nhe got these two sorted out by fiddling around\nwith the knobs when the safe was open in somebody\nelse's office. He'd go back afterwards-- and they don't realize he's been\ndoing this-- and writes down these two numbers\nin a little book and says such and such. So by the end of the\nwar, he could go into anybody's office. He's got the last two numbers. There are 20 settings. It takes him a minute\nand a half to open the safe, or less. So he really has\nto spin it up. He has a reputation\nof safe cracking. And everybody thinks he knows\nhow to use picks. But he's just used human nature,\nthe tolerance of all this, and deviousness, just\nto show how clever he was. He was doing it just to show\nhow clever he was. He was obnoxious. He would like to be one\nup on everybody else. But there was a security\nproblem there. And the guy who he shared a room\nwith was the guy who gave the secrets of the bomb\nto the Russians, which is Klaus Fuchs. He was a roomie of his.

Amaro and his four mateys, Bart, Charlotte, Daniel, and Eliza have struck gold: a chest with 100 coins. But now, they must divvy up the booty\naccording to the pirate code. As captain, Amaro gets to propose\nhow to distribute the coins. Then, each pirate, \nincluding Amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay. If the vote passes, or if there's a tie,\nthe coins are divided according to plan. But if the majority votes nay, Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes captain. Then, Bart gets to propose\na new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again. If his plan is rejected,\nhe walks the plank, too, and Charlotte takes his place. This process repeats, with the captain's hat moving to Daniel\nand then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted\nor there's only one pirate left. Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive\nwhile getting as much gold as possible. But being pirates, \nnone of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance. And being blood-thirsty pirates, if anyone thinks they'll end up\nwith the same amount of gold either way, they'll vote to make the captain\nwalk the plank just for fun. Finally, each pirate is excellent\nat logical deduction and knows that the others are, too. What distribution should Amaro\npropose to make sure he lives? Pause here if you want to figure\nit out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If we follow our intuition, it seems like Amaro should try to bribe\nthe other pirates with most of the gold to increase the chances of his plan\nbeing accepted. But it turns out he can do\nmuch better than that. Why? Like we said, the pirates all know\neach other to be top-notch logicians. So when each votes, they won't just\nbe thinking about the current proposal, but about all possible outcomes\ndown the line. And because the rank order is known\nin advance, each can accurately predict how the others\nwould vote in any situation and adjust their own votes accordingly. Because Eliza's last, she has the most\noutcomes to consider, so let's start by following \nher thought process. She'd reason this out by working\nbackwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining. Daniel would obviously propose\nto keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be\nenough to override him, so Eliza wants to avoid this situation\nat all costs. Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirates left \nand Charlotte making the proposal. Everyone knows that if she's outvoted,\nthe decision moves to Daniel, who will then get all the gold\nwhile Eliza gets nothing. So to secure Eliza's vote, Charlotte only needs to offer her\nslightly more than nothing, one coin. Since this ensures her support, Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel\nanything at all. What if there are four pirates? As captain, Bart would still only need\none other vote for his plan to pass. He knows that Daniel wouldn't want \nthe decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin\nfor his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza. Now we're back at the initial vote\nwith all five pirates standing. Having considered all the other scenarios, Amaro knows that if he goes overboard, the decision comes down to Bart, which would be bad news \nfor Charlotte and Eliza. So he offers them one coin each,\nkeeping 98 for himself. Bart and Daniel vote nay, but Charlotte and Eliza \ngrudgingly vote yarr knowing that the alternative \nwould be worse for them. The pirate game involves some interesting\nconcepts from game theory. One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what\nthe others know and uses this to predict their reasoning. And the final distribution is an example\nof a Nash equilibrium where each player knows every other\nplayers' strategy and chooses theirs accordingly. Even though it may lead to a worse\noutcome for everyone than cooperating would, no individual player can benefit\nby changing their strategy. So it looks like Amaro gets to keep\nmost of the gold, and the other pirates might need\nto find better ways to use those impressive logic skills, like revising this absurd pirate code."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who gets to propose how to distribute the coins?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Amaro"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eliza"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whoever the current captain is"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What happens if a proposal is voted down?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The pirate who made the proposal walks the plank and the next pirate makes a new proposal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The pirate who made the proposal takes note of how everyone voted and makes a new one"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The coins are distributed randomly"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT one of the conditions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A tie vote means the proposal passes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Each pirate will vote nay unless voting yarr gets them more coins"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The pirate making the proposal must offer everyone at least one coin"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the final distribution?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "20 coins for each pirate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "99 coins for Bart, 1 coin for Charlotte, none for the others"}, {"label": "C", "text": "98 coins for Amaro, 1 coin each for Charlotte and Eliza, none for the others"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following game theory concepts is NOT involved in the puzzle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Common knowledge"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Prisoner’s dilemma"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nash equilibrium"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 32, "lesson": 12, "title": "Why should you read Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\"? - Brendan Pelsue", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-tolstoy-s-war-and-peace-brendan-pelsue", "transcript": {"en": "\"War and Peace,\" a tome, a slog, the sort of book you shouldn't read in bed\nbecause if you fall asleep, it could give you a concussion, right? Only partly. \"War and Peace\" is a long book, sure, but it's also a thrilling examination\nof history, populated with some of the deepest, most\nrealistic characters you'll find anywhere. And if its length intimidates you,\njust image how poor Tolstoy felt. In 1863, he set out to write a short novel\nabout a political dissident returning from exile in Siberia. Five years later, he had produced\na 1,200 page epic featuring love stories, battlefields, bankruptcies, firing squads, religious visions, the burning of Moscow, and a semi-domesticated bear, but no exile and no political dissidents. Here's how it happened. Tolstoy, a volcanic soul, was born to a famously eccentric \naristocratic family in 1828. By the time he was 30, he had already\ndropped out of Kazan University, gambled away the family fortune, joined the army, written memoirs, and rejected the literary establishment\nto travel Europe. He then settled into Yasnaya Polyana,\nhis ancestral mansion, to write about the return \nof the Decembrists, a band of well-born revolutionaries\npardoned in 1856 after 30 years in exile. But, Tolstoy thought, how could he tell the story \nof the Decembrists return from exile without telling the story of 1825, when they revolted against \nthe conservative Tsar Nicholas I? And how could he do that without telling\nthe story of 1812, when Napoleon's disastrous \ninvasion of Russia helped trigger the authoritarianism\nthe Decembrists were rebelling against? And how could he tell the story of 1812\nwithout talking about 1805, when the Russians first learned of\nthe threat Napoleon posed after their defeat at \nthe Battle of Austerlitz? So Tolstoy began writing, both about the big events of history and the small lives \nthat inhabit those events. He focused on aristocrats,\nthe class he knew best. The book only occasionally touches on the lives of the vast majority \nof the Russian population, who were peasants,\nor even serfs, farmers bound to serve the owners\nof the land on which they lived. \"War and Peace\" opens on the eve\nof war between France and Russia. Aristocrats at a cocktail party fret\nabout the looming violence, but then change the topic to those things\naristocrats always seem to care about: money, sex, and death. This first scene is indicative of the way the book bounces \nbetween the political and personal over an ever-widening canvas. There are no main characters\nin \"War and Peace.\" Instead, readers enter\na vast interlocking web of relationships and questions. Will the hapless \nand illegitimate son of a count marry a beautiful but conniving princess? Will his only friend survive\nthe battlefields of Austria? And what about that nice young girl\nfalling in love with both men at once? Real historical figures mix and mingle\nwith all these fictional folk, Napoleon appears several times, and even one of Tolstoy's ancestors\nplays a background part. But while the characters \nand their psychologies are gripping, Tolstoy is not afraid to interrupt \nthe narrative to pose insightful \nquestions about history. Why do wars start? What are good battlefield tactics? Do nations rise and fall on the actions\nof so-called great men like Napoleon, or are there larger cultural and economic\nforces at play? These extended digressions are part \nof what make \"War and Peace\" so panoramic in scope. But for some 19th century critics, this meant \"War and Peace\" barely felt\nlike a novel at all. It was a \"large, loose, baggy monster,\"\nin the words of Henry James. Tolstoy, in fact, agreed. To him, novels were \na western European form. Russian writers had to write differently\nbecause Russian people lived differently. \"What is 'War and Peace'?\" he asked. \"It is not a novel. Still less an epic poem. Still less a historical chronicle. 'War and Peace' is what the author wanted\nand was able to express in the form in which it was expressed.\" It is, in other words, the sum total\nof Tolstoy's imaginative powers, and nothing less. By the time \"War and Peace\" ends, Tolstoy has brought his characters\nto the year 1820, 36 years before the events he originally\nhoped to write about. In trying to understand his own times, he had become immersed in the years\npiled up behind him. The result is a grand interrogation\ninto history, culture, philosophy, psychology, and the human response to war."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Tolstoy originally thought \"War and Peace\" would be a book about:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Peace.

Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered \"duck vagina,\"\nyou'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance\nmay not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption \nto reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia\nin insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve\nfaster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense\nbecause evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring,\nits genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools\nfor reproduction, any improvement there \nwill have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having\nsuch decorative nether regions? After all, the function \nof genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it \nand delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female\nshould do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example,\nlooks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find\nin a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems\nnecessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just\ndeposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis\nas courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper\non their penis, which produces a song that reverberates\nthroughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies\nenjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male \nto father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most\nmusical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution\nof insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little\ndrumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap\nthe female with these. And some hoofed mammals,\nlike rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension \non the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose\nbetween males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power\nof female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different\nto conception, and the female genitalia exploit\nthis distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets\nfor separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling \ntheir own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve\ninto such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where\na sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if\nshe fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst\nher offspring. For a male, on the other hand,\nthis is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female\nused his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation\nin an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders \nhave a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina\nblocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's\ngenitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject\nsperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved \ntheir own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely\nnew set of genitalia on their right hand flanks\nwhere the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain\nthe power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped\nlike a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long,\ncounterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do \nis flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much,\nnot just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of \na furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on\nfor millions of years and will continue for millions \nof years to come."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How do male bedbugs fertilize females?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By piercing the skin of her abdomen with a syringe-like penis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By letting a droplet of sperm be absorbed by the skin of the female's abdomen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By piercing the skin of her head with a syringe-like penis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By letting a droplet of sperm be absorbed by the skin of the female's head"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The penis of some South-American species of crane fly have an unusual feature.

More than 100 years after\nhis creator was laid to rest, Dracula lives on as the most famous\nvampire in history. But this Transylvanian noble, neither the first fictional vampire\nnor the most popular of his time, may have remained buried\nin obscurity if not for a twist of fate. Dracula's first appearance was in\nBram Stoker's 1897 novel of the same name. But that was far from the beginning\nof vampire myths. Blood-sucking monsters had already been\npart of folklore for at least 800 years. It was Slavic folklore that gave us\nthe word vampire, or \"upir\" in Old Russian. The term's first known written mention\ncomes from the 11th century. Vampire lore in the region predated\nChristianity's arrival and persisted despite the church's efforts\nto eliminate pagan beliefs. Stories of vampires originated from\nmisinterpretations of diseases, such as rabies, and pellagra, and decomposition. In the case of the latter, gasses swelling\nthe body and blood oozing from the mouth could make a corpse look like\nit had recently been alive and feeding. Vampires were describe as bloated\nwith overgrown teeth and nails. This gave rise to many rituals\nintended to prevent the dead from rising, such as burying bodies with garlic\nor poppyseeds, as well as having them staked, burned, or mutilated. Vampire lore remained a local phenomenon\nuntil the 18th century when Serbia was caught in the struggle\nbetween two great powers, the Habsburg Monarchy and Ottoman Empire. Austrian soldiers and government officials\nobserved and documented the strange local burial rituals, and their reports \nbecame widely publicized. The resulting vampire hysteria\ngot so out of hand that in 1755, the Austrian Empress was forced \nto dispatch her personal physician. He investigated and put an end\nto the rumors by publishing a thorough, \nscientific refutation. The panic subsided, but the vampire\nhad already taken root in Western Europe's imagination, spawning works like \"The Vampyre\" in 1819, and Joseph Sheridan\nLe Fanu's \"Carmilla\" in 1872. This book would greatly influence a young\nIrish drama critic named Bram Stoker. Stoker, who was born in Dublin in 1847, was famously bedridden with an unknown\nillness until the age of seven. During that time, \nhis mother told him folktales and true tales of horror, including her experiences during\nan outbreak of cholera in 1832. There, she described victims buried alive\nin mass graves. Later in his life, Stoker went on to write\nfantasy, romance, adventure stories, and, in 1897, \"Dracula.\" Although the book's main villain\nand namesake is thought to be based on the historical\nfigure of Vlad III Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, the association is mostly just\nthat they share a name. Other elements and characters \nwere inspired directly and indirectly by various works in the Victorian Era, such as \"The Mysterious Stranger.\" The novel, upon release, was only\na moderate success in its day, nor was it even \nStoker's most well-known work, mentioned only briefly in a 1912 obituary. But a critical copyright battle would\ncompletely change Dracula's fate, and catapult the character\ninto literary renown. In 1922, a German studio adapted the novel\ninto the now classic silent film \"Nosferatu\" without paying royalties. Despite changes in character names\nand minor plot points, the parallels were obvious,\nand the studio was sued into bankruptcy. To prevent more plagiarism attempts, Stoker's widow decided\nto establish copyright over the stage version of \"Dracula\" by approving a production \nby family-friend Hamilton Deane. Although Deane's adaptation made drastic\ncuts to the story, it became a classic, thanks largely to Bela Lugosi's \nperformance on Broadway. Lugosi would go on to star in\nthe 1931 film version by Universal, lending the character \nmany of his signature characteristics. And since then, Dracula has risen again\nin countless adaptations, finding eternal life far beyond\nthe humble pages of his birth."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The earliest known word from Eastern Europe we have for vampire is ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Vampyr"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Vukodlak"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Upir"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Umpusa"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "There were two important reasons why the vampire myth spread throughout Eastern Europe.

{"page": 32, "lesson": 15, "title": "Secrets of the X chromosome - Robin Ball", "category": "Growth & Development", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/secrets-of-the-x-chromosome-robin-ball", "transcript": {"en": "The secrets of the X chromosome. These women are identical twins. They have the same nose, the same hair color, the same eye color. But this one is color blind\nfor green light, and this one isn't. How is that possible? The answer lies in their genes. For humans, the genetic information\nthat determines our physical traits is stored in 23 pairs of chromosomes\nin the nucleus of every cell. These chromosomes are made up of proteins\nand long, coiled strands of DNA. Segments of DNA, called genes,\ntell the cell to build specific proteins, which control its identity and function. For every chromosome pair,\none comes from each biological parent. In 22 of these pairs, the chromosomes\ncontain the same set of genes, but may have different versions\nof those genes. The differences arrive from mutations, which are changes to the genetic sequence that may have occurred \nmany generations ago. Some of those changes have no effect, some cause diseases, and some lead to advantageous adaptations. The result of having two versions\nof each gene is that you display a combination\nof your biological parents' traits. But the 23rd pair is unique, and that's the secret behind\nthe one color blind twin. This pair, called the X and Y chromosomes,\ninfluences your biological sex. Most women have two X chromosomes while most men have one X and one Y. The Y chromosome contains genes\nfor male development and fertility. The X chromosome, on the other hand, contains important genes for things other\nthan sex determination or reproduction, like nervous system development, skeletal muscle function, and the receptors in the eyes\nthat detect green light. Biological males with \nan XY chromosome pair only get one copy of all these\nX chromosome genes, so the human body has evolved\nto function without duplicates. But that creates a problem\nfor people with two X chromosomes. If both X chromosomes produced proteins,\nas is normal in other chromosomes, development of the embryo would be\ncompletely impaired. The solution is X inactivation. This happens early in development\nwhen an embryo with two X chromosomes is just a ball of cells. Each cell inactivates one X chromosome. There's a certain degree of randomness\nto this process. One cell may inactivate the X chromosome\nfrom one parent, and another the chromosome\nfrom the other parent. The inactive X shrivels into a clump\ncalled a Barr body and goes silent. Almost none of its genes\norder proteins to be made. When these early cells divide,\neach passes on its X inactivation. So some clusters of cells\nexpress the maternal X chromosome, while others express the paternal X. If these chromosomes\ncarry different traits, those differences \nwill show up in the cells. This is why calico cats have patches. One X had a gene for orange fur\nand the other had a gene for black fur. The pattern of the coat reveals\nwhich one stayed active where. Now we can explain our color blind twin. Both sisters inherited one mutant copy\nof the green receptor gene and one normally functioning copy. The embryo split into twins\nbefore X inactivation, so each twin ended up\nwith a different inactivation pattern. In one, the X chromosome\nwith the normal gene was turned off in the cells that eventually became eyes. Without those genetic instructions, she now can't sense green light\nand is color blind. Disorders that are associated\nwith mutations of X chromosome genes, like color blindness, or hemophilia, are often less severe in individuals\nwith two X chromosomes. That's because in someone with one normal\nand one mutant copy of the gene, only some of their cells would be\naffected by the mutation. This severity of the disorder\ndepends on which X got turned off and where those cells were.

More than you might think. Along with over 5,000 other species,\nthey're mammals, or members of class mammalia. All mammals are vertebrates,\nmeaning they have backbones. But mammals are distinguished \nfrom other vertebrates by a number of shared features. That includes warm blood, body hair or fur, the ability to breathe using lungs, and nourishing their young with milk. But despite these similarities, these creatures also have \nmany biological differences, and one of the most remarkable\nis how they give birth. Let's start with the most familiar,\nplacental mammals. This group includes humans, cats, dogs, giraffes, and even the blue whale,\nthe biggest animal on Earth. Its placenta, a solid disk\nof blood-rich tissue, attaches to the wall of the uterus\nto support the developing embryo. The placenta is what keeps\nthe calf alive during pregnancy. Directly connected to \nthe mother's blood supply, it funnels nutrients and oxygen \nstraight into the calf's body via the umbilical cord, and also exports its waste. Placental mammals can spend far\nlonger inside the womb than other mammals. Baby blue whales, for instance, spend\nalmost a full year inside their mother. The placenta keeps the calf alive\nright up until its birth, when the umbilical cord breaks and the newborn's own respiratory, circulatory, and waste disposal systems take over. Measuring about 23 feet,\na newborn calf is already able to swim. It will spend the next six months drinking 225 liters of \nits mothers thick, fatty milk per day. Meanwhile, in Australia,\nyou can find a second type of mammal - marsupials. Marsupial babies are so tiny and delicate\nwhen they're born that they must continue developing\nin the mother's pouch. Take the quoll, one of the world's\nsmallest marsupials, which weighs only 18 milligrams at birth, the equivalent of about 30 sugar grains. The kangaroo, another marsupial, gives birth to a single \njelly bean-sized baby at a time. The baby crawls down the middle\nof the mother's three vaginas, then must climb up to the pouch, where she spends \nthe next 6-11 months suckling. Even after the baby kangaroo leaves\nthis warm haven, she'll return to suckle milk. Sometimes, she's just one of three babies\nher mother is caring for. A female kangaroo can often simultaneously\nsupport one inside her uterus and another in her pouch. In unfavorable conditions, female kangaroos can pause\ntheir pregnancies. When that happens, she's able\nto produce two different kinds of milk, one for her newborn, and one for her older joey. The word mammalia means of the breast, which is a bit of a misnomer because while kangaroos do produce\nmilk from nipples in their pouches, they don't actually have breasts. Nor do monotremes, the third and arguably\nstrangest example of mammalian birth. There were once hundreds \nof monotreme species, but there are only five left: four species of echidnas\nand the duck-billed platypus. The name monotreme means one hole referring to the single orifice they use\nfor reproduction, excretion, and egg-laying. Like birds, reptiles, fish, dinosaurs, and others, these species lay eggs instead\nof giving birth to live young. Their eggs are soft-shelled, and when their babies hatch, they suckle\nmilk from pores on their mother's body until they're large enough \nto feed themselves. Despite laying eggs and other adaptations\nthat we associate more with non-mammals, like the duck-bill platypus's webbed feet, bill, and the venomous spur \nmales have on their feet, they are, in fact, mammals. That's because they share the defining\ncharacteristics of mammalia and are evolutionarily linked\nto the rest of the class. Whether placental, marsupial, or monotreme, each of these creatures and its unique\nbirthing methods, however bizarre, have succeeded for many millennia\nin bringing new life and diversity into the mammal kingdom."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do you call the solid disc of blood rich tissue that is used to feed and oxygenate the embryo inside of animals such as humans, whales, dogs and cats?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Uterus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Placenta"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Umbilical cord"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ovary"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Human, cats, dogs and whales are all considered:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Placental Mammals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Marsupials"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Monotremes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Land mammals"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When a kangaroo gives birth to her offspring it is the size of a(n) __________ before it first enters her pouch.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Jelly bean"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Baseball"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Squirrel"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Monotremes are mammals that lay eggs.

{"page": 32, "lesson": 18, "title": "Why do we itch? - Emma Bryce", "category": "Biological Bases of Behavior", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-we-itch-emma-bryce", "transcript": {"en": "You're standing at \nthe ready inside the goal when suddenly, you feel an intense itch\non the back of your head. We've all experienced the annoyance \nof an inconvenient itch, but have you ever pondered why\nwe itch in the first place? The average person experiences\ndozens of individual itches each day. They can be triggered by all sorts\nof things, including allergic reactions, dryness, and even some diseases. And then there are the mysterious ones\nthat pop up for no reason at all, or just from talking about itching. You're scratching your head right now,\naren't you? Anyhow, let's take one of the most\ncommon sources: bug bites. When a mosquito bites you, it releases a compound into your body\ncalled an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting. That compound, \nwhich we're mildly allergic to, triggers the release of histamine, a chemical that makes \nour capillaries swell. This enables increased blood flow, which helpfully accelerates \nthe body's immune response to this perceived threat. That explains the swelling, and it's the same reason pollen\ncan make your eyes puff up. Histamine also activates the nerves\ninvolved in itching, which is why bug bites make you scratch. But the itchy sensation itself\nisn't yet fully understood. In fact, much of what we do know comes from studying \nthe mechanics of itching in mice. Researchers have discovered that\nitch signals in their skin are transmitted via a subclass of\nthe nerves that are associated with pain. These dedicated nerves produce a molecule\ncalled natriuretic polypetide B, which triggers a signal that's carried\nup the spinal cord to the brain, where it creates the feeling of an itch. When we scratch, the action of our\nfingernails on the skin causes a low level pain signal\nthat overrides the itching sensation. It's almost like a distraction,\nwhich creates the sensation of relief. But is there actually an evolutionary\npurpose to the itch, or is it simply there to annoy us? The leading theory is that our skin\nhas evolved to be acutely aware of touch so that we're equipped to deal with risks\nfrom the outside world. Think about it. Our automatic scratching response\nwould dislodge anything harmful that's potentially lurking on our skin, like a harmful sting, a biting insect, or the tendrils of a poisonous plant. This might explain why we don't\nfeel itching inside our bodies, like in our intestines, which is safe from these external threats, though imagine how \nmaddening that would be. In some people, glitches in the pathways\nresponsible for all of this can cause excessive itching\nthat can actually harm their health. One extreme example is a psychological\ncondition called delusory parasitosis where people believe their bodies\nare infested with mites or fleas scurrying over and under their skin, making them itch incessantly. Another phenomenon \ncalled phantom itching can occur in patients \nwho've had amputations. Because this injury has \nso severely damaged the nervous system, it confuses the body's normal \nnerve signaling and creates sensations in limbs\nthat are no longer there. Doctors are now finding ways\nto treat these itching anomalies. In amputees, mirrors are used to reflect\nthe remaining limb, which the patient scratches. That creates an illusion \nthat tricks the brain into thinking the imaginary \nitch has been satisfied. Oddly enough, that actually works. Researchers are also searching\nfor the genes involved in itching and developing treatments to try\nand block the pathway of an itch in extreme cases. If having an unscratchable itch\nfeels like your own personal hell, Dante agreed. The Italian poet wrote about\na section of hell where people were punished by being\nleft in pits to itch for all eternity."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What triggers itching?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Allergies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dryness"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Illness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When a mosquito bites you, it results in the release of __________, which causes an itching sensation.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Histamine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fluids"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What other sensations are the nerve cells that transmit itch signals associated with?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ticklish sensations"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Heat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Burning"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is one of the real-world threats that itching could warn us about?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A change in temperature"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Insect bites"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fumes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pain"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "True or false: Sometimes itch signals can be misleading, making people feel sensations that don’t exist.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Compare that with the tortoise,\nwhich can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives\nafter just four years, while for the bowhead whale,\nEarth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually\ndegenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied\nand complicated, but aging is ultimately \ncaused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young, \nwe constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform\ntheir functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results \nin disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns\nand lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary\npressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process\ndifferent across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic\nand Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live\nto over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog\ncan live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these\nocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years\nin frigid waters. In cold environments like these,\nheartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also\ncauses a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment \nshapes longevity. When it comes to size, \nit's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer\nlifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale\nwill live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies\nand worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics \nof their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't\ndivide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver\nin animals. Smaller creatures are more prone\nto predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect\nto survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce\nmore rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism\nagainst its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better\nat fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time\nto grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times\nduring their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats,\nbirds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other\nadaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals\nwith similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells\nrespond to threats, often account for the discrepancies\nin longevity. So it's the combination \nof all these factors playing out to differing degrees\nin different animals that explains the variability we see\nin the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have \nan average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being\nthe longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing\nour life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived\nan average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt\nby managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure\nand nutrition. This, and other increases \nin life expectancy make us possibly the only species\non Earth to take control over our natural fate."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following factors is not thought to contribute to aging?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Faster tissue regeneration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cell death"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Older cells not working as well"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Slower tissue regeneration"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following factors is thought to contribute to the short lifespan of roundworms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Most cells unable to divide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Improved DNA repair"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Susceptibility to infections"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Highly dividing cells"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following has the shortest lifespan?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mouse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elephant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Vole"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the longest-lived mammal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elephant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Galapagos tortoise"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bowhead whale"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Human being"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How long have Arctic glass sponges been estimated to live?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "<10 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": ">100,000 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About 1,000 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": ">10,000 years"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Are boys smarter than girls? Early studies show that male brains are 8 to 13 percent larger in volume than female brains, however this has been since attributed to differences in body size. Women's brains have more gyrofication or brain folding, and as a result, a greater cortical surface area. Besides, bigger isn't always better. Sperm whales, elephants and dolphins all have larger brains than humans, and while they are smart, their cognitive abilities are less than our own. There are other structural differences, though, like males having more connections within hemispheres, while women have more connections between hemispheres. But overall, MRI brain imaging shows significant overlap in the physical structure between the sexes. After studying 14 hundred brains and comparing the sexes, researchers found that mostly all men and woman show a mosaic of female and male typical structures in the brain. This study also evaluted gender stereotypical behaviours. Like how video games are often considered male behaviour while scrapbooking is female and the results found that 0.1% of test subjects displayed only male or only female typical behaviours. Tests on intelligence find similar results with major IQ studies showing neglible, or no sex differences in general intelligence but do show women having stronger verbal abilities while men show stronger visual-spatial abilities. Interestingly, studies show more male variance in tests with their scores being both the worst and the best. One meta analysis of 22 studies did fiund men to be 3.3 to 5.5 IQ points above women but this study has been called into question by academics who found the methodology flawed. In academic performance of language, math and science, women consistently received better grade in 70% of nations. But on SAT testing in the U.S. men scored 33 points higher in math and science. Other tests like the Program for International Student Assessment showed both sexes performing equally in several countries with girls performing better in some like Iceland suggesting cultural and environmental differences and not necessarily biological differences at play. But research has found that stereotypes about womens performance actually impact how well they do. When told that a particular math test had significant gender differences, women performed significantly worse than their male peers. While women who were told there was no difference, scored the same. This phenomenom is known as the stereotype threat. Even google search data shows that parents 2.5 times more likely to search is my son gifted than is my daughter gifted? Despite 11% more girls in gifted programs in America. And girls pick up on these bias as early as 6 years old. When told a story at age 5 about a person who is really really smart both boys and girls associate intelligence with there own gender but by age 6 both girls and boys picked a male character as the smartest. In a similar experiment kids were asked if they wanted to play a game for people who are really really smart and again at age 5 both sexes wanted to play but by age 6, girls had decided these games weren't for them. and though women do strive to work in STEM fields studies show they face barriers. In a double blind study science faculty from research universities rated applications for a lab manager position. What they didn't know is that the applications were randomly assigned either male or female names. As a result, faculty perceived the male applicant names to be significantly more competent, hireable and deserving of mentoring even though the applications with female names were identical. Males were also offered higher starting salaries, an average of 30,000 versus the females 26,000. Though these studies produce a sobering reality research does point to growing equality between the sexes with passing decades and education and in spite of these barriers women continue to contribute to our collective scientific knowledge. Rosalind Franklin allowed us to understand our own DNA, Katherine Johnson helped Apollo 11 land on the moon and this year Maryam Mirzakhani is the first women to win a Nobel prize for mathematics. Fellow mathematician Izabella Laba said \"Mirzakhan's selection does exactly nothing to convince me that women are capable of doing mathematical research at the same level of men. I have never had any doubt about that in the first place.. What I take from it instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, are becoming better at encouraging and nurturing mathematical talent in women, and more capable of reconizing excellence in women's work.\" To learn more we asked the women at ASAP Science to speak personally about their experiences growing up and give insight about how they navigate the societal pressures of being a woman.

Each room is connected to the adjacent\nones by an airlock, and the virus has been released\nin every room except the entrance. To destroy it, you must enter each\ncontaminated room and pull its emergency \nself-destruct switch. But there's a catch. Because the security system \nis on lockdown, once you enter the contaminated room, you can't exit without \nactivating the switch, and once you've done so, you won't be able to go \nback in to that room. You start to draw out possible\nroutes on a pad of paper, but nothing seems to get you\nto the exit without missing at least one room. So how can you destroy the virus\nin every contaminated room and survive to tell the story? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If your first instinct is to try to graph\nyour possible moves on a grid, you've got the right idea. This puzzle is related to \nthe Hamiltonian path problem named after the 19th century Irish \nmathematician William Rowan Hamilton. The challenge \nof the path problem is to find whether a given graph\nhas a Hamiltonian path. That's a route that visits \nevery point within it exactly once. This type of problem, classified \nas NP-complete, is notoriously difficult when the graph\nis sufficiently large. Although any proposed solution\ncan be easily verified, we have no reliable formula or shortcut\nfor finding one, or determining that one exists. And we're not even sure\nif it's possible for computers to reliably find \nsuch solutions, either. This puzzle adds a twist\nto the Hamiltonian path problem in that you have to start \nand end at specific points. But before you waste a ton of graph paper, you should know that a true\nHamiltonian path isn't possible with these end points. That's because the rooms form a grid\nwith an even number of rooms on each side. In any grid with that configuration, a Hamiltonian path that starts and \nends in opposite corners is impossible. Here's one way of understanding why. Consider a checkerboard grid with\nan even number of squares on each side. Every path through it will alternate\nblack and white. These grids will all also have an even\ntotal number of squares because an even number times\nand even number is even. So a Hamiltonian path on an\neven-sided grid that starts on black will have to end on white. And one that starts on white\nwill have to end on black. However, in any grid with even\nnumbered sides, opposite corners are the same color, so it's impossible to start and end\na Hamiltonian path on opposite corners. It seems like you're out of luck, unless you look at the rules carefully\nand notice an important exception. It's true that once you activate\nthe switch in a contaminated room, it's destroyed and you can never go back. But there's one room \nthat wasn't contaminated - the entrance. This means that you can leave it once\nwithout pulling the switch and return there when you've\ndestroyed either of these two rooms. The corner room may have\nbeen contaminated from the airlock opening,\nbut that's okay because you can destroy the entrance\nafter your second visit. That return trip gives you four options\nfor a successful route, and a similar set of options if you\ndestroyed this room first. Congratulations. You've prevented\nan epidemic of apocalyptic proportions, but after such a stressful episode,\nyou need a break. Maybe you should take up that recent\njob offer to become a traveling salesman."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "If you start in the Northwest corner, in how many ways will you end up in the Southeast corner if you pass through every room exactly once?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It’s not possible"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Once you’ve entered a contaminated room, what must you do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exit the way you came in"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Call for help"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pull the room’s emergency self-destruct switch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Close the airlock yourself"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In which grid setting would you be able to start in the Northwest corner and end up in the Southeast corner if you pass through every room exactly once?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2x2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5x5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6x6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3x2"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In which room has the virus not been released?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The entrance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The second one you enter"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The exit"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None--the virus has been released in all rooms"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is significant about the fact that the virus has not been released in the entrance?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The virus will not harm anyone who enters"}, {"label": "B", "text": "You can go back into the entrance after entering the first room and can then get to the exit after visiting each room"}, {"label": "C", "text": "You can escape through the entrance and the virus will not contaminate anyone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is no significance"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

The battered vessel and its 18\nsailors were all that remained of a fleet that had departed\nthree years before. Yet her voyage was considered a success for the \"Victoria\" had achieved\nsomething unprecedented: the first circumnavigation\nof the globe. But this story really begins in 1494, two years after Columbus's voyage\non behalf of Spain. Columbus's discovery had prompted\nthe Catholic Spanish rulers to turn to the Pope to preempt\nany claims by Portugal to the new lands. The Pope resolved this dispute by drawing\nan imaginary line on the world map. Spain had the right to claim territories\nwest of the divide, and Portugal to the east. Spain and Portugal, the two major\nseafaring super powers at the time, agreed to these terms in what came\nto be called the Treaty of Tordesillas. At the time, these nations had their\neyes on the same prize: trade routes to the Spice Islands\nin today's Indonesia. The spices found there, which were used as seasonings, food preservatives, and aphrodisiacs, were worth many times \ntheir weight in gold. But because of Portugal's control\nover eastern sea routes, Spain's only viable option\nwas to sail west. So when a Portuguese defector\nnamed Ferdinand Magellan claimed that a westward route\nto the Spice Islands existed, King Charles made him captain\nof a Spanish armada, and gave him all the resources \nhe would need. Along with a share \nin the voyage's profits, he granted Magellan five ships\nand about 260 men. The crew included a young slave\nnamed Enrique, captured by Magellan on a previous\njourney to Malacca, and Antonio Pigafetta, a Venetian nobleman seeking adventure. On September 20, 1519, \nthe fleet weighed anchor and headed southwest. After making landfall \nin what is now Brazil, it proceeded along the coast,\nexploring any water way leading inland. They were looking for the fabled passage\nlinking east and west. As the weather worsened, the Spaniards resentment\nat having a Portuguese captain escalated. A full-blown mutiny soon erupted, which Magellan crushed \nwith unspeakable cruelty. But his problems were only just beginning. During a reconnaissance mission, \nthe \"Santiago\" was wrecked by a storm. Then while exploring a narrow waterway, the captain of the \"San Antonio\" took\nthe first opportunity to slip away and sail back home. Magellan pressed forward, and on October 21, he started exploring\na navigable sea way. 27 freezing days later, the three remaining ships emerged\nfrom what we now call the Strait of Magellan\ninto the Mar Pacifico. The fleet never expected the new ocean\nto be so vast. After 98 days at sea, dozens of sailors\nhad succumbed to scurvy and famine. When they finally reached land again, Enrique, the young slave, proved\nable to communicate with the natives. Their goal couldn't be far. Sailing further west, Magellan was warmly\nreceived by Rajah Humabon of Cebu. So when the ruler asked him to help subdue and convert \nthe rebellious chief of Mactan, the captain readily agreed. The adventure would be his last. Overconfident and severely outnumbered,\nMagellan's force was overwhelmed, and the native's bamboo spears\nended the captain's life. Yet the voyage had to continue. Magellan's will specified that Enrique\nshould be freed, but the expedition still needed\nan interpreter. With his freedom at stake, Enrique is believed to have plotted\nwith the Rajah to have about 30 of the Spaniards killed\nat a feast on the beach. Enrique was never heard from again, but if he ever made it back to Malacca, he may have been the first person\nto actually circumnavigate the globe. Meanwhile, the survivors \nburned the Concepcion and proceeded onward. They finally reached the Spice Islands\nin November of 1521 and loaded up on precious cargo. But they still had to return to Spain. The \"Trinidad\" sank shortly after being\ncaptured by the Portuguese. The \"Victoria\" continued west,\npiloted by Juan Sebastián Elcano, one of the pardoned mutineers. Against all odds, the small vessel\nmade it back to Spain with a full cargo of cloves and cinnamon, enough to cover the expedition\nand turn a profit. An obsessive chronicler, Pigafetta described the lands\nand people they encountered. With the help of a humble slave, he also compiled \nthe world's first phrase book of native languages. His journal is the reason we can\ntell this story. Magellan's legacy lingers. He had galaxies and space programs\nnamed after him. Elcano, too, was celebrated in Spain with a coat of arms and his face\non currency and stamps. United by fate, the survivors and the hundreds \nwho sacrificed their lives challenged conventional wisdom and completed a historic journey\nonce thought impossible."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was Magellan trying to accomplish when he proposed an expedition to King Charles I, of Spain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He wanted to prove that the Earth was round"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He wanted to find a passage connecting East and West"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He wanted to find a western route to the Spice Islands"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He wanted to find a cure for scurvy"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the assertions below is not true with regard to Ferdinand Magellan?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He sailed for Spain, but was Portuguese national"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He was the first man to circumnavigate the globe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He had been to Malacca in a previous expedition"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He was killed in the island of Mactan"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How long did it take Magellan to cross what is now known as the Strait of Magellan?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A couple of weeks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Almost a full month"}, {"label": "C", "text": "21 days"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Four days, for he had been there before"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was so special about cloves, cinnamon and other spices?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They tasted great"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They were used to preserve food, enhance flavors and create arousal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They were inexpensive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nothing really.
