In slowly. Out slowly. In slowly. Out. The same pattern repeats within\nevery one of us and consider your pulse. The beat is built into the very\nfabric of our being. Simply put, we're creatures of rhythm\nand repetition. It's central to our experience, rhythm and repetition, rhythm and repetition. On, and in, and on, and out. And we delight in those aspects everyday, in the rhythm of a song, the beat of the drum, the nod of your head, or in the repetition of soup cans, the rows of an orchard, the artistry of petals. Pattern can be pleasure. In language, rhythm and repetition\nare often used as the building blocks for poetry. There's the rhythm of language, created by syllables and their emphasis, such as, \"So long as men can breathe\nor eyes can see.\" And there's the repetition of language\nat multiple levels: the repetition of letters, \"So long lives this\nand this gives life to thee,\" of sounds, \"breathe,\" \"see,\" \"thee,\" and of words. With so many uses, repetition\nis one of the poet's most malleable and reliable tools. It can lift or lull the listener, amplify or diminish the line, unify or diversify ideas. In fact, even rhythm itself, a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition. Yet for all its varied uses, too much repetition can backfire. Imagine writing the same sentence\non the blackboard twenty times, again, and again, and again, and again, or imagine a young child clamoring\nfor her mother's attention, \"Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom.\" Not exactly what we might call poetry. So what is poetic repetition,\nand why does it work? Possibly most familiar is rhyme, the repetition of like sounds\nin word endings. As with Shakespeare's example, we often encounter rhyme\nat the ends of lines. Repetition in this way creates\nan expectation. We begin to listen for the repetition\nof those similar sounds. When we hear them, \nthe found pattern is pleasurable. Like finding Waldo in the visual chaos, we hear the echo in the oral chatter. Yet, rhyme need not surface solely\nat a line's end. Notice the strong \"i\" sound in, \"So long lives this \nand this gives life to thee.\" This repetition of vowel sounds\nis called assonance and can also be heard \nin Eminem's \"Lose Yourself.\" Notice how the \"e\" and \"o\" sounds\nrepeat both within in and at the end of each line: \"Oh, there goes gravity, Oh, there goes rabbit,\nhe choked, he so mad but he won't\ngive up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's\nto these ropes.\" The alternating assonance\ncreates its own rhythm, and invites us to try our own voices\nin echoing it. Similarly, consonance is the repetition\nof like consonant sounds, such as the \"l\" and \"th\" in, \"So long lives this\nand this gives life to thee.\" In fact, this type of specific consonance, which occurs at the beginning of words may be familiar to you already. It's called alliteration,\nor front rhyme. Great examples include tongue twisters. Betty bought some butter \nbut the butter was bitter so Betty bought some better butter\nto make the bitter butter better. Here, the pleasure in pattern is apparent\nas we trip over the consonance both within words and at their start. Yet tongue twisters also reflect the need\nfor variation in poetic repetition. While challenging to say, they're seen by some\nas lesser imitations of poetry, or gimmicky because they hammer\nso heavily on the same sounds, closer to that blackboard-style \nof repetition. Ultimately, this is the poet's \nbalancing act, learning when to repeat and when to riff, when to satisfy expectations, and when to thwart them, and in that balance, \nit may be enough to remember we all live in a world of wild variation and carry with us our own breath and beat, our own repetition wherever we go."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "We are creatures of repetition within our own bodies.

But all you have to go on \nis the following information picked up by your surveillance team. The headquarters is a massive pyramid\nwith a single room at the top level, two rooms on the next, and so on. The control panel is hidden\nbehind a painting on the highest floor that can satisfy\nthe following conditions: Each room has exactly three doors\nto other rooms on that floor, except the control panel room, which connects to only one, there are no hallways, and you can ignore stairs. Unfortunately, \nyou don't have a floor plan, and you'll only have enough time\nto search a single floor before the alarm system reactivates. Can you figure out which floor\nthe control room is on? Pause now to solve the riddle yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To solve this problem, \nwe need to visualize it. For starters, we know \nthat on the correct floor there's one room, let's call it room A, with one door to the control panel room, plus one door to room B, and one to C. So there must be at least four rooms, which we can represent as circles, drawing lines between them\nfor the doorways. But once we connect rooms B and C, there are no other connections possible, so the fourth floor down \nfrom the top is out. We know the control panel has to be\nas high up as possible, so let's make our way down the pyramid. The fifth highest floor \ndoesn't work either. We can figure that out by drawing it, but to be sure we haven't missed\nany possibilities, here's another way. Every door corresponds to a line\nin our graph that makes two rooms into neighbors. So in the end, there have to be\nan even number of neighbors no matter how many connections we make. On the fifth highest floor,\nto fulfill our starting conditions, we'd need four rooms \nwith three neighbors each, plus the control panel room\nwith one neighbor, which makes 13 total neighbors. Since that's an odd number,\nit's not possible, and, in fact, this also rules out every\nfloor that has an odd number of rooms. So let's go one more floor down. When we draw out the rooms, low and behold, we can find an arrangement\nthat works like this. Incidentally, the study \nof such visual models that show the connections and\nrelationships between different objects is known as graph theory. In a basic graph, the circles representing\nthe objects are known as nodes, while the connecting lines \nare called edges. Researchers studying such graphs\nask questions like, \"How far is this node from that one?\" \"How many edges does \nthe most popular node have?\" \"Is there a route between these two nodes,\nand if so, how long is it?\" Graphs like this are often used\nto map communication networks, but they can represent almost\nany kind of network, from transport connections within a city and social relationships among people, to chemical interactions between proteins or the spread of an epidemic\nthrough different locations. So, armed with these techniques,\nback to the pyramid. You avoid the guards and security cameras, infiltrate the sixth floor from the top, find the hidden panel, pull some conspicuous levers, and send the death ray crashing\ninto the ocean. Now, time to solve the mystery of why your surveillance team\nalways gives you cryptic information. Hi everybody.

That was definitely an E ticket. - [Voiceover] Shuttle Control Houston. That was Mission Specialist Sally Ride comparing her flight to Disneyland. - [Sally] I wish that there had been another woman on my flight. I wish that two of us\nhad gone up together. I think it would have been a lot easier. - [Gloria] It’s tough being the first, but you’ve done it with incredible grace. You also have the only job in the world that everybody understands. (laughing) - [Sally] My father, I\nthink, was so grateful when I became an astronaut because he did not understand astrophysicist. He couldn’t relate to that at all, but astronaut was something\nhe felt he understood. - [Gloria] But you could see\npeople all over the world connecting with what you were doing. - [Sally] Roughly half the people in the world would love to be astronauts, would give anything to\ntrade places with you, and the other half just can’t understand why in the world you would\ndo something that stupid. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] You don’t have 20-20 vision, can you become an astronaut candidate? I always thought that was\na big disabling factor. - [Sally] I think it used to be. Now as long as it’s correctable\nto 20-20, it’s okay. So you’d probably qualify. (laughing) (upbeat instrumental music) I didn’t have any dreams about\nbeing an astronaut at all and I don’t understand that because as soon as the opportunity was\nopen to me, I jumped at it. And I instantly realized that that was what I really wanted to do. I took all the science\nclasses that I could all the way through junior high\nschool and into high school. I went to a girls’\nschool that really didn’t have a strong science program\nat all when I was there. At the time it was a\nclassic school for girls, with a good tennis team\nand a good English teacher and essentially no math\npast eleventh grade and no physics and no chemistry. - [Gloria] I’m curious about the reception that you got inside NASA. What kind of thing happened to you? - [Sally] Really the only bad moments in our training involved the press. The press was an added\npressure on the flight for me and whereas NASA appeared to be very enlightened about flying women astronauts, the press didn’t appear to be. The things that they were concerned with were not the same things\nthat I was concerned with. - [Gloria] For instance,\nthe bathroom facilities. - [Sally] The bathroom facilities. - [Gloria] How much\ndid you get asked that? - [Sally] Just about every\ninterview I got asked that. Everybody wanted to know about what kind of makeup I was taking up. They didn’t care about how well-prepared I was to operate the arm or deploy communications satellites. - [Gloria] Did NASA try to prepare you for the press and the pressure? - [Sally] Unfortunately, no, they don’t. You know, in my case, they took a graduate student in physics who had spent her life in the basement of a physics department with oscilloscopes and suddenly put me in front of the press. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What do you\nsuppose are the dumbest kinds of questions you’ve\nbeen asked to date? - [Sally] Without a doubt, I think the worst question\nthat I have gotten was whether I cried when we got malfunctions in the simulator. (laughing) No. - [Gloria] That surpassed even the one about whether you’re going\nto wear a bra or not. Did somebody really ask you that? - [Sally] No. The press, I think, decided\nthat that was a good question for someone to have asked me and for me to have answered\nbut I never got that question. - [Gloria] And they made you\nup quite a good response. Something about \"in a\nstate of weightlessness \"it doesn’t matter,\"\nor something like that? - [Sally] Yeah, it was\nsomething like that. - [Gloria] They made up this whole thing? - [Sally] Yeah, I was\nnever asked that question. (upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What about your\nfeelings during the launch? Was there any time that the enormity of what was going on came over you? - [Sally] The moment of the launch, when the engines actually ignited and the solid rockets lit, everyone on the crew\nwas, for a few seconds, just overcome with what\nwas about to happen to us. But a year of training is a long time. A year of sitting in simulators and being told exactly\nwhat’s going to happen. And you hear the sounds and\nyou feel the vibrations. And they prepare you\nvery well and it worked. We were able to overcome being overcome and do the things that\nwe were supposed to do. - [Gloria] Just watching\nthere at the launch, there were people with tears\nstreaming down their faces, people I never would have expected and yet they were all very moved by, I guess, the human audacity of it. - [Sally] I think that to imagine, when you see the long trail of flame, and then to imagine that there are really people inside\nthat, that’s really something. Inside, of course, you don’t see the long trail of flame and what you’re feeling is\nreally more of an exhilaration. - [Gloria] Well, there are lots of people looking up there feeling proud, not only of you up there\nbut also on the ground.

(upbeat instrumental music) - [Gloria] What do you think it might be like in 2001, in fact? What’s possible for us? - [Sally] Well, 2001 is a long ways in the future to speculate on, but probably the next step\nafter the space shuttle is gonna be to be a space station. I would foresee a space station as being not just something\nthat is orbiting the earth and used for experimentation or whatever, but would also be used\nas a launching platform back to the Moon or to Mars. And I think both of those are inevitable. I’m sure we’ll go back to the Moon and I’m sure it’s only a matter of time before we send people to Mars. - [Gloria] Do you have any speculation about how long it might be perhaps before there are such things\nas peopled space colonies? - [Sally] I’d guess that probably by the year 2000 there will be. I think that we’ll have a space station by the end of this decade. - [Gloria] On which it would be possible to live for long periods of time? - [Sally] Yes.

{"page": 39, "lesson": 4, "title": "Why do people have seasonal allergies? - Eleanor Nelsen", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-some-people-have-seasonal-allergies-eleanor-nelsen", "transcript": {"en": "Ah, spring. Grass growing, flowers blooming,\ntrees growing new leaves, but if you get allergies, this explosion of new life probably\ninspires more dread than joy. Step outside, and within minutes,\nyou're sneezing and congested. Your nose is running, your eyes are swollen and watery, your throat is itchy. For you and millions of others,\nit's seasonal allergy time. So what's behind this onslaught of mucus? The answer lies within you. It's your immune system. Seasonal allergies, also called hay fever,\nor allergic rhinitis, are a hypersensitive immune response\nto something that's not actually harmful. Pollen from trees and grass, and mold spores from tiny fungi\nfind their way into your mucous membranes and your body attacks \nthese innocuous travelers the same way it would infectious bacteria. The immune system has a memory. When a foreign substance gets tagged\nas threatening, white blood cells produce \ncustomized antibodies that will recognize the offender\nthe next time around. They then promptly recruit\nthe body's defense team. But sometimes, the immune system\naccidentally discriminates against harmless substances,\nlike pollen. When it wafts in again, antibodies\non the surface of white blood cells recognize it and latch on. This triggers the cell to release\ninflammatory chemicals, like histamine, which stimulate nerve cells, and cause blood vessels in the mucous \nmembranes to swell and leak fluid. In other words, itchiness, sneezing,\ncongestion, and a runny nose. Allergies usually, but not always, show up\nfor the first time during childhood. But why do some people get allergies\nand others don't? Allergies tend to run in families,\nso genetics may be one culprit. In fact, errors in a gene that helps\nregulate the immune system are associated \nwith higher rates of allergies. The environment \nyou grow up in matters, too. Being exposed to an allergen as a baby makes you less likely to actually develop\nan allergy to it. People who grow up on farms, in big families, and in the developing world also tend\nto have fewer allergies, although there are plenty of exceptions,\npartly thanks to genetics. One theory is that as children, they encounter more of the microbes\nand parasites that co-evolved with traditional\nhunter-gatherer societies. Called the hygiene hypothesis, the idea is that when the immune system isn't exposed \nto the familiar cast of microbes, it'll keep itself busy mounting\ndefenses against harmless substances, like pollen. Another theory is that an immune system\ntoughened up by a barrage of pathogens is less likely to overreact to allergens. Pollen is a common offender,\njust because we encounter so much of it, but there's a long list of substances: dust, animal dander, insect venom, medications, certain foods, that can send your immune system\ninto overdrive. Some of these reactions can be scary. An allergy can develop\ninto full-blown anaphylaxis, which typically brings on severe swelling, shortness of breath, and very low blood pressure. It can be deadly. The body can even have \nan allergic reaction to itself causing auto-immune disorders, like multiple sclerosis, lupus,\nand type 1 diabetes. But even non-life threatening allergy\nsymptoms can make you miserable, so what can you do about it? Medications can help reduce the symptoms. The most common ones keep histamines\nfrom binding to your cells. These antihistamines \nstop the inflammation response. Steroids can help dial down \nthe immune system. Another more permanent option\nis immunotherapy. Deliberate, controlled exposure to gradually increasing \namounts of an allergen can teach the immune system\nthat it isn't dangerous after all. And if you're really adventurous,\nthere's a less traditional option: intestinal parasites. When hookworms sink their teeth\ninto the intestinal wall, they secrete chemicals \nthat blunt the immune system. Some studies suggest that hookworms\ncan treat allergies, which may be another reason allergies are more common \nin industrialized countries where hookworms are few\nand far between. Of course, you can always just wait\nyour seasonal allergies out. The spring pollen onslaught dwindles\nby mid-summer, just in time for ragweed season."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which type of cells are most directly involved in the immune response?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Red blood cells"}, {"label": "B", "text": "White blood cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Skin cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lung cells"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When these cells recognize an allergen, they release chemicals.

{"page": 39, "lesson": 5, "title": "Ralph Waldo Emerson and the Beauty of the Everyday", "category": "Philosophy", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/8H0FHeWq", "transcript": {"en": "Ralph Waldo Emerson is the father of\nAmerican literature. In a series of strikingly original essays, written in\nthe mid-nineteenth century, he fundamentally changed the way that\nAmerica saw its cultural and artistic possibilities, and he enabled a\nseparation from transatlantic literary traditions. \"We have listened too long...\", he wrote, \"...to the Courtly muses of Europe.\" Emerson's abjection of cultural\ntraditions brought about what one contemporary called: \"America's\nintellectual declaration of independence.\" and he established generational conflict\nand transformation as commanding ideas in American literature. Emerson himself hardly seemed destined\nto fit a revolutionary mold. He was born in 1803, the son of a Boston\npreacher, and was descended from a line of New England ministers that went back\nto the bedrock of seventeenth-century Puritanism. When his father died in 1811, \nhis mother took in boarders to pay the rent. Still, she sent her son to Harvard in\n1817, and then Harvard divinity school to train for the priesthood in 1825. As a young man, Emerson was strongly influenced by a\nremarkable aunt of his: Mary Moody Emerson, who though self-taught, had read\neverything from Shakespeare to the romantics and it formed a unique\nreligious perspective based on piety nature and literature, that would\nresonate powerfully in the life and work of her nephew. So when Emerson was ordained in 1829,\nmarrying the love of his life Ellen Tucker in the same year, he was\nalready unsatisfied with the formal nature of New England religious\northodoxy. When Ellen died of tuberculosis just two years later, he\nresigned from the church and soon after embarked on a trip to Europe. Leaving on Christmas Day 1832,\ntwo crucial things happened to Emerson on that tour of europe. In Paris, he went to the famous \"Jardin des Plantes\", a botanical and zoological garden. There he had an epiphany. Writing in his journal that: \"I feel the\ncentipede in me, the Cayman, carp, eagle and Fox... ...I am moved by strange sympathies. I say\ncontinually: I will be a naturalist.\". Emerson's insight was that nature is in us, a part of us, and not just its higher forms, but in all its grotesquerie and\nwildness. The second thing that happened on that\ntour, was that Emerson met the English romantic poets: Samuel Taylor Coleridge\nand William Wordsworth, and found them rather ordinary, dry \nand conservative men. The insight that Emerson drew from this, was that if great men could be so\nordinary, why should not ordinary men be great? as he would write a few years later, meek young men grow up in libraries, believing\nit their duty, to accept the views which Cicero, Locke, Bacon have given. Forgetful\nthat Cicero, Locke and Bacon were only young men in libraries when they wrote\nthese books. Emerson had found two ideas that would\nguide his life's work. That man and nature are one and that everyone can\nrecognize that they are a uniquely, significant human being. On his return to America in 1833, Emerson\nbecame a professional lecturer giving talks on natural history and literature in halls around New England. He remarried and had several children, presenting a stolid, bourgeois\nappearance to the world. But his inner life was full of\nturbulence and originality. In his 1836 essay, \"Nature\", Emerson outlined the germ of a new\nphilosophy, a key element of this, was the importance of American originality. In\nits opening lines, Emerson wrote: \"Our age is retrospective, it builds the sepulchres\nof the fathers. It writes biographies, histories and criticism. The foregoing\ngenerations beheld God and nature face to face; we, through their eyes. Why should not we\nalso enjoy an original relation to the universe?\". America, needed to stop looking\nback to its European heritage and start looking about it self. No past moment was more important,\nthan the present moment. No tradition was more important, than\nnovelty. No generation, was better than the current generation. Everything that\nmatters is here now insisted Emerson, and that here was: America. This was an extension of Emerson's ideas,\nabout the significance of the individual that came under the heading of what he\ncalled \"self-reliance\". Everywhere Emerson looked, he saw people leading lives that were based on tradition, that were limited by religious forms and social\nhabits. No one could be themselves, Emerson\nthought, because they were all too busy being what they were supposed to be. Emerson wanted to get rid of each of\nthese burdens: the past, religion and social forms, so that each person could\nfind out who they truly were. As he put it: \"History is an impertinence and an injury; Our religion, we have not chosen, but\nsociety has chosen for us... And... ...Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the\nmanhood of every one of its members.\" We must, he argued, live from within\ntrusting nothing but our own intuitions. For, as he concluded... ...nothing is at last sacred but the\nintegrity of your own mind. This leaves open a vital question: What\nis your nature... ...once you've rid yourself of history,\ntradition and religion? What can be said is that it isn't\nnecessarily self-indulgence, haterism or narcissism. Rather, it's the surrender to that force\nwhich Emerson recognized back in the Jardin des Plantes. An obedience to nature itself. By nature, Emerson seem to mean the natural world: \nplants, animals, rocks and sky, but what he really meant was God. Emerson was a \"Pantheist\". That is, someone\nwho believe that God exists in every part of creation, from the smallest grain\nof sand to the stars. But also crucially that the divine spark\nis in each of us. In following ourselves, we are therefore not merely being fickle or selfish, we are rather, releasing a divine will, that history, society and organized religion normally hide from us. The individual as\nEmerson writes \"is a God in ruins\". But we have it within us, by casting off all\ncustom to rebuild ourselves Emerson makes this Pantheist connection,\nexplicit in what are perhaps his most famous lines. \"Crossing a bear common, in\nsnow puddles at twilight under a clouded sky, without having in my thoughts any\noccurrence of special good fortune, I've enjoyed a perfect exhilaration. I am\nglad to the brink of fear, standing on the bare ground, my head\nbathed by the blythe air and uplifted into infinite space, all mean egotism vanishes... ...I become a transparent eyeball... ...I am nothing... ...I see all. The currents of\nthe universal being circulate through me... ...I am part or particle of God! In the Romantic tradition on which\nEmerson draws, it is the sublime, great mountains, rushing torrance, dark forests, which releases the inner vision as we find ourselves in all of them. For Emerson, it's a perfectly dull walk across an\nordinary common on a dark winter's evening that brings him, to the brink of fear. Emerson's God, is in the snow puddles too. Stood there on the common, he disappears, becoming nothing as the\ncurrents of God flow through him. What is left is just, a transparent\neyeball. Such transcendent moments are rare, but they reveal an essential\nconnection between nature, God and man. They are one. They also give Emerson a proper sense of\neach individual's importance, as a part of God. Transcendentalism became the name of the\nmovement that grew up around Emerson, at this time. Another aspect of the epiphany\nthat was to have a profound effect on American literature, was the\nemphasis on the value of the ordinary. What Emerson put forward in essays like\n\"The American scholar\" and \"the poet\", was that the American every day, was a proper\nsubject for literature. This was because for Emerson, the\ntranscendentalist God is everywhere, and it's the poet's job to reveal this. \"There is no object...\", he wrote, \"...so foul that\nintense light will not make it beautiful.\" \"...Even a corpse has its own beauty.\" This\ncoming from a man who had opened his first wife's tomb a year after her death... ...to take a look! The great American writers, who followed Emerson, were liberated by his work to\nlook around and write about what they saw and how they lived, transforming the everyday into a vital\nsymbol of something higher and more elusive. Henry David Thoreau's two years\nat Walden Pond, became a book that showed the cosmos reflected in the depths of\nthe waters of a mere pond. The poet Walt Whitman said: \"I was\nsimmering, simmering, simmering... ...Emerson brought me to a boil.\" Emily Dickinson heard a fly and could\nwrite of the other side of death. The novelist Herman Melville, took a whaling voyage, and made it an allegory\nof American imperialism and the defiance of nature. In the 20th century, the\nAmerican critic Harold Bloom looked back at Emerson's originality and saw in it\nthe origin of: \"The strong tradition of American poets.\" From Robert Frost and\nWallace Stevens to John Ashbery, Emerson's legacy to american literature\nand culture and indeed to the world, was one of ceaseless invention and forward\nmomentum. As he put it: \"I unsettle all things... ...no facts are to me sacred, none are profane... ...I simply experiment an endless seeker\nwith no past at my back.\" people of Paul pronouncing his name if you don't\nspeak German it's not at all obvious how you're supposed to say it a safe bet is\nto start with a hard was a great check writer who has come to own a part of the\nhuman emotional spectrum which we can now call the casket desk and which\nthanks to him where"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Finish this quote by Emerson: \"We have listened too long to the courtly muses of ...\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "\"the aristocracy\""}, {"label": "B", "text": "\"Europe\""}, {"label": "C", "text": "\"the Beaux Arts\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "\"our elders\""}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to Emerson, where did he experience his first pantheistic revelations?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Walden Pond"}, {"label": "B", "text": "on the Boston Commons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a botanical garden in Paris"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Emerson was a transcendentalist.

About 60% of it is actually\na cold and dark region known as the deep ocean. And it reaches down to 11,000 meters. Yet, this remote zone is also one\nof the greatest habitats on Earth, harboring a huge diversity of life, from giant squids and goblin sharks to minuscule animals \nsmaller than a millimeter. How do so many species thrive\nin this underwater world? Over the decades, intrepid scientists\nhave ventured there to find out. Traveling down through the water column, pressure increases \nand light begins to wane. At 200 meters, photosynthesis stops and temperature decreases \nfrom surface temperatures by up to 20 degrees Celsius. By 1000 meters, normal sunlight\nhas disappeared altogether. Without light, life as we know it\nseems impossible. That's why in 1844, the naturalist \nEdward Forbes wrote his Azoic Theory, Azoic, meaning without animals. Forbes was sure that nothing could survive\nbelow 600 meters on account of the lack of light. Of course, the discovery \nof deep-sea species proved him wrong. What Forbes failed to take into account\nis something called marine snow, which sounds much nicer than it is. Marine snow is basically organic matter, things like particles of dead algae,\nplants, and animals, drifting down into the depths and acting as food for deep-sea animals. Largely thanks to that, \nabundant life forms exist in the darkness, adapting to a harsh reality where only\nthe weird and wonderful can survive. Fish with cavernous mouths, spiky teeth jutting from their jaws, and lamp-like structures \nprotruding from their heads, like the anglerfish which entices prey\nwith its misleading glow. Several sea creatures have perfected\nthis lightning technique known as bioluminescence, using it to lure prey, distract predators, or attract mates. Some creatures use it for camoflauge. In parts of the water column where\nonly faint blue light filters through, animals bioluminesce to match the glow. Predators or prey looking up\nfrom below are deceived by this camoflauge, unable to see the creatures silhouette. Such otherworldly adaptations also arise\nfrom the need to locate and snatch up food before it drifts away. Some sea animals, like jellyfish,\ncomb jellies and salps can migrate between depths partially because \ntheir 90% water consistency allows them to withstand immense pressure. But they're the exception. Most deep-sea creatures are confined\nto a narrow range in the water column where nutrients are scarce since the food drifting downwards\nfrom the surface rapidly sinks to the sea floor. Plunging all the way down,\nwe find more exotic creatures. Some take on dwarfism, a trait that transforms them \ninto miniature versions of animals we see closer to the surface. It's thought that reduced \nfood availability causes the shrinkage. Only a tiny fraction of the food produced\nat the surface reaches the sea floor, so being small gives animals\na low energy requirement and an adaptive advantage. And yet, the sea is also the land\nof giants. Here, gargantuan squids can reach\n18 meters long. Isopods scuttle around the sea floor\nlike enormous wood lice. There are long-limbed \nJapanese spider crabs, and oarfish, whose bodies stretch\nto 15 meters. This trait is known as gigantism,\nand it's something of a mystery. It's thought that high oxygen levels\nmay drive extreme growth in some species, while the colder temperatures promote\nlonger life spans, giving animals the opportunity \nto grow massive. Many of these exotic sea beasts will never\nexperience sunlight. Some will venture up through\nthe water column to feed, and a few will actually break the waves, reminding us at the surface about the incredible survival skills\nof the ocean's deepest inhabitants. Humans still have an astounding\n95% of the ocean left to explore. So those depths remain a great mystery.

But why? And how? And will the universe\nbe dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of\nits expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that\nscientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe\nmust work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point\nit has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe\nis actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up\nand watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but\nwe call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and\nthen decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have\ndecided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,\nand we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they\nlead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe\nhas been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces\ncreated everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,\nso they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,\nbut here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion\naccelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity\ncan’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like\ngalaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects\nexpands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,\nstars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep\nthem together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand\nfaster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,\nand they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,\nno particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless\nlonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,\ntimeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between\nthe Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays\nintact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period\nof time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?\nLet’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the\nstate of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but\nover time, they will cool down and disintegrate,\nuntil it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets\nbigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations\nof stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,\nso the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;\n black holes will slowly degenerate\nand evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a\ndilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases\nat this point; entropy is at its maximum and\nthe universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might\nbe possible that after an incredibly\nlong amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy\ndecrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to\na new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think\nor it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the\nuniverse one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of\nexpansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,\nmerging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means\na hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big\nCrunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the\nmost stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,\natom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes\ndevour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into\na supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire\nmass of the universe, and in the last moment before\nthe Big Crunch it would devour the universe,\nincluding itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this\nhas happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through\nan infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to\nthe universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most\nlikely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the\nuniverse will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so\nlet’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account.

Not even close. Our bodies leave a lot to autopilot, which\nis a good thing, because imagine having to regulate your heartbeat and your breathing\nand your digestive system and your body temperature, all while not peeing your pants or falling\ndown. That would be hard. Many of those involuntary actions are mysterious,\nannoying, just plain weird. Here are five of the human body’s strangest\nout of control behaviors. Start typing “why does my” into Google\nand the top result is an eye-opener. Involuntary twitching of the muscles around\nthe eye has a number of causes including dry eyes, caffeine, bright lights, and just like\nduring a tough workout, from simple fatigue. It’s usually totally harmless and eventually\ngoes away on its own and is a good hint that you’ve probably been looking at that screen\nenough for one day. Looking at bright light can cause more than\nan eye twitch. In Aristotle’s \"Book of Problems\" he asks “Why is it that one sneezes more\nafter one has looked at the sun” proving that people have been asking\na lot of the same questions for a long time and that no one told Aristotle that you’re\nnot supposed to stare at the sun. Like, ever. Don’t do it. The so-called photic sneeze reflex, AKA the\nAutosomal Cholinergic Helio-Ophthalmic Outburst, abbreviated \"ACHOO\"… yes, seriously… is\nexperienced by about 1 in 4 people, leading scientists to believe it is genetically heritable. While the exact cause hasn’t been pinpointed,\nmany scientists think it’s due crosstalk between the optic nerve and nerve that feeds\nthe tickling sensation in your nose. The visual cortex of sun-sneezing people is also prone\nto overstimulation, which might send the sneeze sensing parts of their brain haywire. Have you ever been just about to go to sleep,\nwalking through the gates to Dreamland, only to have the floor pulled out from under you\nand you’re suddenly falling and then you wake up! This frustrating sleep starts have another\ncool medical name, hypnagogic myoclonus. When we drift off, the areas of our brain\nthat control motor function are inactivated in favor of those that control our sleep cycles,\nwhich is why you can dream about riding your bike without actually moving your feet. As the sleepy part of your brain fight with\nthe awake and moving parts of your brain, the battle can spontaneously tip back in favor\nof the motor control side and suddenly you’re like… WHOA, I'm awake. Sleep starts aren’t the only myocloni that\nwe experience. Hiccups are an uncontrollable contraction\nof the diaphragm muscle that we use to draw air into our lungs. About a quarter second after that muscle contracts,\nthe vocal cords snap shut, creating the characteristic [hic]. Scientists still aren’t sure what causes\nem, but possible explanations include hiccups being an evolutionary remnant from a few hundred\nmillion years ago when our ancestors still had to pump water over their gills. Or, since hiccups mainly happen in mammals,\nthat they started as a way for nursing infants to clear air from their stomachs. If you want to get rid of hiccups, it seems\nthat increasing the amount of CO2 in your blood can do the job, which is common remedies\ninclude drinking water, holding our breath, or breathing into a paper bag. Yawning, another long, slow, involuntary form\nof breathing, is common throughout the animal kingdom and even happens in the womb. We know it’s associated with sleep and boredom,\nbut that doesn’t explain why it happens, and like most human behaviors, if you stop\nand think about yawning long enough it starts to become a really, really weird thing to\ndo. Hippocrates believed that yawns released noxious\nfumes that had built up in the body, but modern medicine has shown us that usually happens\non the other end of the body. We also know that about 50% of people who\nobserve a yawn will yawn in response, so it’s thought to be a social cue to synchronize\nbiological clocks. One theory says yawns might even cool the\nbrain slightly to make us more alert as we get bored or sleepy. Even watching someone talk for extended periods\nof time can induce yawning, so next time you’re getting bored in class, tell your teacher\nit’s Mother Nature’s fault. Finally, I’ll leave you with one bonus behavior:\npost-micturition convulsion syndrome, or the pee shivers. This is another behavior for which scientists\nhaven’t quite shaken out all the details, but some believe its simply because we’re\nexposing sensitive areas of our body to the cold while we expel some internal warmth. They might also arise from a bit of conflict\nbetween our autonomous nervous system that’s usually quietly keeping all that pee inside\nand the part of our conscious mind that’s in charge of the plumbing at that moment. These weird, wild, and often twitchy behaviors\nmay defy nice, neat explanations, and yes, sometimes they are very annoying, but in the\ngreat movie that is life, they’re a nice reminder of all the amazing things going on\nbehind the scenes.

{"page": 39, "lesson": 9, "title": "Making sense of irrational numbers - Ganesh Pai", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/making-sense-of-irrational-numbers-ganesh-pai", "transcript": {"en": "Like many heroes of Greek myths, the philosopher Hippasus was rumored to\nhave been mortally punished by the gods. But what was his crime? Did he murder guests, or disrupt a sacred ritual? No, Hippasus's transgression was\na mathematical proof: the discovery of irrational numbers. Hippasus belonged to a group\ncalled the Pythagorean mathematicians who had a religious reverence for numbers. Their dictum of, \"All is number,\" suggested that numbers \nwere the building blocks of the Universe and part of this belief was that \neverything from cosmology and metaphysics to music and morals followed eternal rules describable as ratios of numbers. Thus, any number could be written\nas such a ratio. 5 as 5/1, 0.5 as 1/2 and so on. Even an infinitely extending decimal like\nthis could be expressed exactly as 34/45. All of these are what we now call\nrational numbers. But Hippasus found one number\nthat violated this harmonious rule, one that was not supposed to exist. The problem began with a simple shape, a square with each side \nmeasuring one unit. According to Pythagoras Theorem, the diagonal length \nwould be square root of two, but try as he might, Hippasus could not\nexpress this as a ratio of two integers. And instead of giving up, he decided\nto prove it couldn't be done. Hippasus began by assuming that the\nPythagorean worldview was true, that root 2 could be expressed\nas a ratio of two integers. He labeled these hypothetical integers\np and q. Assuming the ratio was reduced\nto its simplest form, p and q could not have any common factors. To prove that root 2 was not rational, Hippasus just had to prove that\np/q cannot exist. So he multiplied both sides \nof the equation by q and squared both sides. which gave him this equation. Multiplying any number by 2\nresults in an even number, so p^2 had to be even. That couldn't be true if p was odd because an odd number times itself\nis always odd, so p was even as well. Thus, p could be expressed as 2a,\nwhere a is an integer. Substituting this into the equation\nand simplifying gave q^2 = 2a^2 Once again, two times any number\nproduces an even number, so q^2 must have been even, and q must have been even as well, making both p and q even. But if that was true, then they had\na common factor of two, which contradicted the initial statement, and that's how Hippasus concluded\nthat no such ratio exists. That's called a proof by contradiction, and according to the legend, the gods did not appreciate \nbeing contradicted. Interestingly, even though we can't\nexpress irrational numbers as ratios of integers, it is possible to precisely plot\nsome of them on the number line. Take root 2. All we need to do is form a right triangle\nwith two sides each measuring one unit. The hypotenuse has a length of root 2,\nwhich can be extended along the line. We can then form another\nright triangle with a base of that length\nand a one unit height, and its hypotenuse would equal\nroot three, which can be extended \nalong the line, as well. The key here is that decimals and ratios\nare only ways to express numbers. Root 2 simply is the hypotenuse\nof a right triangle with sides of a length one. Similarly, the famous irrational number pi is always equal \nto exactly what it represents, the ratio of a circle's circumference\nto its diameter. Approximations like 22/7, or 355/113 will never precisely equal pi. We'll never know what really happened\nto Hippasus, but what we do know is that his discovery\nrevolutionized mathematics.

Every pair only has two possibilities:\nthey either know each other or they don't. There are a lot of possibilities, but every single one has the property \nthat we're looking for. Six is the lowest number of guests\nwhere that's guaranteed to be the case, which we can express like this. Ramsey theory gives us a guarantee that such a minimum number exists\nfor certain patterns, but no easy way to find it. In this case, as the total number\nof guests grows higher, the combinations get out of control. For instance, say you're trying\nto find out the minimum size of a party where there's a group of five people\nwho all know each other or all don't. Despite five being a small number, the answer is virtually \nimpossible to discover through an exhaustive search like this. That's because of the sheer \nvolume of possibilities. A party with 48 guests has 2^(1128) possible configurations, more than the number of atoms \nin the universe. Even with the help of computers, the best we know is that the answer\nto this question is somewhere between 43 and 49 guests. What this shows us \nis that specific patterns with seemingly astronomical odds can emerge from a relatively small set. And with a very large set,\nthe possibilities are almost endless. Any four stars where no three \nlie in a straight line will form some quadrilateral shape. Expand that to the thousands \nof stars we can see in the sky, and it's no surprise that we can\nfind all sorts of familiar shapes, and even creatures if we look for them. So what are the chances of a text\nconcealing a prophecy? Well, when you factor\nin  the number of letters, the variety of possible related words, and all their abbreviations \nand alternate spellings, they're pretty high. You can try it yourself. Just pick a favorite text, arrange the letters in a grid, and see what you can find. The mathematician T.S. Motzkin \nonce remarked that, “while disorder is more probable \nin general, complete disorder is impossible.\" The sheer size of the universe guarantees\nthat some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements, and because we evolved to notice patterns\nand pick out signals among the noise, we are often tempted to find intentional\nmeaning where there may not be any. So while we may be awed by hidden messages\nin everything from books, to pieces of toast, to the night sky, their real origin \nis usually our own minds."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following statements is true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Melville predicted Martin Luther King’s assassination"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Melville predicted Princess Dianna’s death"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Melville was a prophet and wrote his prediction within the words of Moby Dick"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Melville wrote a very long text which resulted in an endless set of potential connections"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to the Ramsey theory and the “party problem,” in a group of six party goers which statement is true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Some group of three of them either all know each other or have never met before"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No-one knows each other"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Everyone will know someone who knows someone else"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Connections for this many people cannot be predicted"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What characteristic of the universe virtually guarantees that some of its random elements will fall into specific arrangements?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Its massive size"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The mass of objects contained within them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The distance between celestial objects"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Does Ramsey theory tell us how to find a particular structure in a given system?

I live in Kenya, at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. Those are my dad's cows at the back, and behind the cows, that's the Nairobi National Park. Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely, which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. So predators like lions follow them, and this is what they do. They kill our livestock. This is one of the cows which was killed at night, and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead, and I felt so bad, because it was the only bull we had. My community, the Maasai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them, and that's why we value them so much. So I grew up hating lions so much. The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset about this problem. So they kill the lions. It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community is responsible for his dad's cows, and that's the same thing which happened to me. So I had to find a way of solving this problem. And the first idea I got was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared of fire. But I came to realize that that didn't really help, because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed. So I didn't give up. I continued. And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. I was trying to trick the lions [into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed. But lions are very clever. (Laughter) They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back, but the second day, they'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. (Laughter) So he jumps in and kills the animals. So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch, and that day, the lions didn't come. And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. So I had an idea. Since I was a small boy, I used to work in my room for the whole day, and I even took apart my mom's new radio, and that day she almost killed me, but I learned a lot about electronics. (Laughter) So I got an old car battery, an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle, and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off. And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. So I set up everything. As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. And the indicator box makes the lights flash. As you can see, the bulbs face outside, because that's where the lions come from. And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed, but I was sleeping in my bed. (Laughter) (Applause) Thanks. So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions. And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. One of them was this grandmother. She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions, and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. And I said, \"Yes.\" So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights. Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community, and they're really working. And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards, and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms. Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited about this. My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. I even took my friends back to my community, and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them. So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows, and I used to see planes flying over, and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside. And here I am today. I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. I used to hate lions, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much. (Applause) Chris Anderson: You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours. So you got this scholarship.Richard Turere: Yep. CA: You're working on other electrical inventions. What's the next one on your list? RT: My next invention is, I want to make an electric fence.CA: Electric fence? RT: But I know electric fences are already invented, but I want to make mine. (Laughter) CA: You already tried it once, right, and you --RT: I tried it before, but I stopped because it gave me a shock. (Laughter) CA: In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else.

You've already earned $1000 \nin the first round when you land on the bonus space. Now, you have a choice. You can either take \na $500 bonus guaranteed or you can flip a coin. If it's heads, you win $1000 bonus. If it's tails, you get no bonus at all. In the second round, you've earned $2000\nwhen you land on the penalty space. Now you have another choice. You can either take a $500 loss, or try your luck at the coin flip. If it's heads, you lose nothing, but if it's tails, you lose $1000 instead. If you're like most people, you probably chose to take\nthe guaranteed bonus in the first round and flip the coin in the second round. But if you think about it,\nthis makes no sense. The odds and outcomes in both rounds\nare exactly the same. So why does the second round\nseem much scarier? The answer lies in a phenomenon\nknown as loss aversion. Under rational economic theory, our decisions should follow a simple\nmathematical equation that weighs the level of risk\nagainst the amount at stake. But studies have found \nthat for many people, the negative psychological impact\nwe feel from losing something is about twice as strong as the positive\nimpact of gaining the same thing. Loss aversion is one cognitive bias\nthat arises from heuristics, problem-solving approaches based on\nprevious experience and intuition rather than careful analysis. And these mental shortcuts can lead\nto irrational decisions, not like falling in love or bungee jumping off a cliff, but logical fallacies that can easily\nbe proven wrong. Situations involving probability are\nnotoriously bad for applying heuristics. For instance, say you were to roll a die\nwith four green faces and two red faces twenty times. You can choose one of \nthe following sequences of rolls, and if it shows up, \nyou'll win $25. Which would you pick? In one study, 65% of the participants\nwho were all college students chose sequence B even though A is shorter\nand contained within B, in other words, more likely. This is what's called \na conjunction fallacy. Here, we expect to see more green rolls, so our brains can trick us into picking\nthe less likely option. Heuristics are also terrible \nat dealing with numbers in general. In one example, students were split\ninto two groups. The first group was asked whether\nMahatma Gandhi died before or after age 9, while the second was asked whether\nhe died before or after age 140. Both numbers were obviously way off, but when the students were then asked\nto guess the actual age at which he died, the first group's answers averaged to 50 while the second group's averaged to 67. Even though the clearly wrong information\nin the initial questions should have been irrelevant, it still affected the students' estimates. This is an example \nof the anchoring effect, and it's often used in marketing\nand negotiations to raise the prices \nthat people are willing to pay. So, if heuristics lead to \nall these wrong decisions, why do we even have them? Well, because they can be quite effective. For most of human history, survival depended on making quick\ndecisions with limited information. When there's no time to logically\nanalyze all the possibilities, heuristics can sometimes save our lives. But today's environment requires\nfar more complex decision-making, and these decisions are more biased\nby unconscious factors than we think, affecting everything from health \nand education to finance and criminal justice. We can't just shut off \nour brain's heuristics, but we can learn to be aware of them. When you come to \na situation involving numbers, probability, or multiple details, pause for a second and consider that the intuitive answer\nmight not be the right one after all."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "According to rational economic theory, people make decisions by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Following precise mathematical rules that ensure the optimal outcome"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Randomly and without careful consideration of the odds at stake"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Following their instinct"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Weighing all possible options and then letting feelings decide"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The difficulty in considering the real value of a product once its price its known, is an example of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Conjunction fallacy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anchoring effect"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Loss aversion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is a heuristic?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An intuitive way to solve problems based on careful analysis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An intuitive way to solve problems based on previous experience"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A rational problem-solving approach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An irrational decision"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to loss aversion, people’s choices are biased on the fact that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Losing is always perceived as better than winning"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Winning is always perceived as worse than losing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Winning $10 has a stronger positive psychological impact than losing $10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Losing $10 has a stronger negative psychological impact than winning 10"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Do heuristics always lead to a wrong choice?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes, as they are based on intuition"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yes, as they are based on irrational decisions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "No. Heuristics carry an adaptive value as they allow quick decisions even with limited information"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No, as they always lead to the best possible choice"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

The icon of genius. Why? Because he figured out E equals m c squared? Because he didn't like socks? Nope! Because he came up with the most powerful idea in science.. General Relativity His masterpiece is now 100 years old. And while the physicists are partying, the rest of us are left wondering what the BLEEP it’s all about! Well here goes. At 26 he figured out nothing less than a new theory of space and time. It led to a nifty way of simplifying physics – by treating space and time as one thing... Spacetime! But Albert was just warming up. He wasn’t happy with Isaac Newton’s mysterious force of gravity. Naturally, he started work on his own theory. And sure enough, he cracked it. Mass causes spacetime to curve! The natural motion of things is to follow the simplest path through spacetime. But since objects with mass curve spacetime, stuff moves towards the most massive objects. That’s what you feel as gravity. It’s warped space and time that’s keeping your feet on the ground. “Warped space” might sound too sci-fi to be true. But we can measure the bending of starlight as is passes through the warped space around the sun. Warped time sounds even more ridiculous. But take an accurate clock to the top of a building and you’ll see it runs slightly quicker than one on the ground! That’s because as you move away from the centre of the planet space and time are less warped. Most amazing of all, Einstein’s theory told us that our universe has a beginning. Everything is expanding out from a hot dense origin 13.8 billion years ago. But here’s the catch: We’ve spotted that the universe is expanding faster than Albert’s theory predicts. Could the old genius be wrong? To stick with his idea we’ve had to invent a made up energy - ‘dark energy’ - to account for the speedy expansion. And we’ve had to assume there’s an exotic form of ‘dark matter' we haven’t detected yet either. These two unknowns should make up 95% of the universe – yet we’ve never detected them. That’s the sort of thing that keeps physicists awake at night. So they’re plotting some seriously big experiments to put Albert’s theory to the ultimate test. For the last 100 years, uncle Albert’s great theory has passed every test possible. If it succeeds again physicists will party. If they find its limits and it finally fails they’ll party too.

And for the computers that often act\nas extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role, whether it's a two-hour movie, a two-word text file, or the instructions for opening either, everything in a computer's memory\ntakes the form of basic units called bits, or binary digits. Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states\nfor two possible values, 0 and 1. Files and programs consist of millions\nof these bits, all processed in \nthe central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain. And as the number of bits needing\nto be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face \na constant struggle between size, cost, and speed. Like us, computers have short-term memory\nfor immediate tasks, and long-term memory \nfor more permanent storage. When you run a program, your operating system allocates area\nwithin the short-term memory for performing those instructions. For example, when you press a key\nin a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations\nto retrieve bits of data. It could also modify them,\nor create new ones. The time this takes is known \nas the memory's latency. And because program instructions must be\nprocessed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory\ncan be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory. The most common type of RAM \nis dynamic RAM, or DRAM. There, each memory cell consists\nof a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge,\nor a 1 when charged. Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly\nbefore they leak away, requiring periodic recharging\nto retain data. But even its low latency \nof 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, \nhigh-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM. That's usually made up \nof six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing. SRAM is the fastest memory \nin a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times \nmore space than DRAM. But RAM and cache can only hold data\nas long as they're powered. For data to remain\nonce the device is turned off, it must be transferred \ninto a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types. In magnetic storage, \nwhich is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on\na spinning disc coated with magnetic film. But because the disc must rotate \nto where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000 \ntimes slower than that of DRAM. On the other hand, optical-based storage\nlike DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating. Bits are encoded as light and dark spots\nusing a dye that can be read by a laser. While optical storage media are cheap\nand removable, they have even slower latencies \nthan magnetic storage and lower capacity as well. Finally, the newest and fastest types of\nlong-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks. These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping \nor removing electrical charges within their specially designed \ninternal structures. So how reliable \nare these billions of bits? We tend to think of computer memory\nas stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly. The heat generated from a device\nand its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage \nin floating gates. Solid-state drives \nalso have an additional weakness. Repeatedly writing to floating gate \ntransistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless. With data on most current storage media having less than \na ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit\nthe physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making \nmemory devices faster, smaller, and more durable. For now, immortality remains out of reach,\nfor humans and computers alike."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is the fastest memory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "DRAM"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hard drive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "SRAM"}, {"label": "D", "text": "CD-ROM"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the common feature between DRAM and SRAM?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are both made of a transistor and a capacitor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are both made of six transistors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They both lose their contents when powered off"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They both store data by the way of trapping electrons"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "An unopened photo is kept in the _____ of a computer.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "CPU's cache"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hard drive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "RAM"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the fundamental memory element in flash memory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Magnetic disks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Optical disks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Transistors and capacitors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Floating-gate transistors"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 39, "lesson": 15, "title": "How do we separate the seemingly inseparable? - Iddo Magen", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-we-separate-the-inseparable-iddo-magen", "transcript": {"en": "Your cell phone is mainly made\nof plastics and metals. It's easy to appreciate \nthe inventive process by which those elements are made to add up\nto something so useful and entertaining. But there's another story \nwe don't hear about as much. How did we get our raw ingredients\nin the first place from the chaotic tangle of materials\nthat is nature? The answer is a group of clever hacks\nknown as separation techniques. They work by taking advantage\nof the fundamental properties of things to disentangle them from each other. Simple separation techniques\napply to many physical scenarios, like separating cream from milk, extracting water from soil, or even sifting out flecks of gold\nfrom river sand. But not all mixtures \nare so easy to unravel. In some of those cases, we can exploit the differences between\nphysical properties within a mixture, like particle size, density, or boiling point to extract what's required. Take petroleum, a mixture of different \ntypes of hydrocarbons. Some of these are valuable as fuels, and others make good raw materials\nfor generating electric power. To separate them, experts rely on one\nimportant feature: different hydrocarbons boil \nat different temperatures. During the boiling process,\neach type vaporizes at a precise point, then gets separately funneled \ninto a container and collected as a liquid as it cools. Separation techniques \nalso take us to the sea. In some drought-stricken countries, the ocean is the only \navailable water source. But of course,\nhumans can't drink salt water. One way to get around this problem is to remove salt from sea water \nwith reverse osmosis, a process that separates \nwater's ingredients by size. A membrane with pores \nbigger than water particles, but smaller than salt particles, only lets fresh water pass through, transforming what was once undrinkable\ninto a life saver. Meanwhile in the medical world, blood tests are a vital tool \nfor evaluating a person's health, but doctors typically \ncan't examine blood samples until they've separated \nthe solid blood cells from the liquid plasma \nthey're dissolved in. To do that, a powerful rotational force\nis exerted on the test tube, causing heavier substances \nwith higher density, like blood cells, to move away from the rotational axis. Meanwhile, lighter substances \nwith lower density, like plasma, move to its center. The tube's contents divide clearly, and the blood cells and liquid plasma\ncan be tested independently. But sometimes, unlike oil,\nseawater, and blood, the parts of mixtures \nthat we want to separate share the same physical properties. In these cases, the only way to isolate \ningredients is by chemical separation, a complex process that relies \non unique interactions between components within a mixture\nand another material. One of these methods is chromatography, a tool forensic scientists use \nto examine crime scenes. They dissolve gathered evidence in a gas, and can monitor \nand analyze the ingredients as they separate \nand move at varying speeds due to their unique chemical properties. That information then tells scientists\nprecisely what was present at the scene, often helping to identify the culprit. Separation techniques are not just about\nindustry, infrastructure, medicine, and justice.

A ravenous snake that is capable of\ndevouring an alligator. Rabbit populations that eat\nthemselves into starvation. These aren't horror movie concepts. They're real stories, but how could such situations\nexist in nature? All three are examples\nof invasive species, organisms harmful not because\nof what they are, but where they happen to be. The kudzu vine, for example, had grown quality in its native east Asia,\neaten by various insects and dying off during the cold winters. But its fortunes changed when it was imported \ninto the southeastern United States for porch decoration and cattle feed. Its planting was even subsidized\nby the government to fight soil erosion. With sunny fields, a mild climate,\nand no natural predators in its new home, the vine grew uncontrollably until it became known as the plant\nthat ate the South. Meanwhile in Florida's Everglades,\nBurmese pythons, thought to have been released\nby pet owners, are the cause of decreasing populations\nof organisms. They're successfully outcompeting\ntop predators, such as the alligator and panther, causing a significant reduction\nin their food sources. They're not a problem\nin their native Asia because diseases, parasites, and predators\nhelp to control their population size. And in Australia, European rabbits\neat so many plants that they wipe out the food supply\nfor themselves and other herbivores. They're a pretty recent addition, intentionally introduced to the continent\nbecause one man enjoyed hunting them. Like the Burmese pythons, various factors in their native habitat\nkeep their numbers in control. But in Australia, the lack of predators and a climate perfect \nfor year-long reproduction allows their populations to skyrocket. So why does this keep happening? Most of the world's ecosystems are the result of millennia \nof coevolution by organisms, adapting to their environment \nand each other until a stable balance is reached. Healthy ecosystems maintain this balance\nvia limiting factors, environmental conditions that restrict\nthe size or range of a species. These include things \nlike natural geography and climate, food availability, and the presence or absence of predators. For example, plant growth depends\non levels of sunlight and soil nutrients. The amount of edible plants affects\nthe population of herbivores, which in turn impacts the carnivores\nthat feed on them. And a healthy predator population keeps\nthe herbivores from becoming too numerous and devouring all the plants. But even minor changes in one factor\ncan upset this balance, and the sudden introduction\nof non-native organisms can be a pretty major change. A species that is evolved\nin a separate habitat will be susceptible to different \nlimiting factors, different predators, different energy sources, and different climates. If the new habitat's limiting factors\nfail to restrict the species growth, it will continue to multiply, out-competing native organisms\nfor resources and disrupting the entire ecosystem. Species are sometimes introduced\ninto new habitats through natural factors, like storms, ocean currents, or climate shifts. The majority of invasive species,\nthough, are introduced by humans. Often this happens unintentionally, as when the zebra mussel was accidentally\nbrought to Lake Erie by cargo ships. But as people migrate around the world, we have also deliberately brought\nour plants and animals along, rarely considering the consequences. But now that we're learning more about the effects of invasive species\non ecosystems, many governments closely monitor\nthe transport of plants and animals, and ban the imports of certain organisms. But could the species with\nthe most drastic environmental impact be a group of primates who emerged\nfrom Africa to cover most of the world?

It certainly doesn't seem that way. Plants don't have complex sensory\nor nervous systems like animals do, and they look pretty passive, basking in the sun, and responding instinctively\nto inputs like light and water. But odd as it sounds, \nplants can communicate with each other. Just like animals, plants produce \nall kinds of chemical signals in response to their environments, and they can share those signals\nwith each other, especially when they're under attack. These signals take two routes: through the air, and through the soil. When plant leaves get damaged, whether by hungry insects\nor an invading lawn mower, they release plumes\nof volatile chemicals. They're what's responsible for the smell\nof freshly cut grass. Certain kinds of plants, \nlike sagebrush and lima beans, are able to pick up on those\nairborne messages and adjust their \nown internal chemistry accordingly. In one experiment, sagebrush leaves\nwere deliberately damaged by insects or scissor-wielding scientists. Throughout the summer, other branches on the same sagebrush plant got eaten less \nby insects wandering through, and so did branches on neighboring bushes, suggesting that they had beefed up\ntheir anti-insect defenses. Even moving the air from above\na clipped plant to another one made the second plant \nmore insect-resistant. These airborne cues increase \nthe likelihood of seedling survival, and made adult plants produce\nmore new branches and flowers. But why would a plant warn\nits neighbors of danger, especially if they're competing \nfor resources? Well, it might be an accidental \nconsequence of a self-defense mechanism. Plants can't move information through\ntheir bodies as easily as we can, especially if water is scarce. So plants may rely \non those airborne chemicals to get messages from \none part of a plant to another. Nearby plants can eavesdrop \non those signals, like overhearing your neighbor sneeze\nand stocking up on cold medicine. Different plants convey those warnings\nusing different chemical languages. Individual sagebrush plants \nin the same meadow release slightly different sets\nof alarm chemicals. The makeup of that cocktail influences\nthe effectiveness of communication. The more similar \ntwo plants' chemical fingerprints are, the more fluently they can communicate. A plant will be most sensitive to the cues\nemitted by its own leaves. But because these chemicals seem\nto be inherited, like human blood types, sagebrush plants communicate \nmore effectively with relatives than with strangers. But sometimes, even other species\ncan benefit. Tomato and tobacco plants can both\ndecipher sagebrush warning signals. Plants don't have to rely solely\non those airborne broadcasts. Signals can travel \nbelow the soil surface, too. Most plants have a symbiotic relationship\nwith fungi, which colonize the plants' roots\nand help them absorb water and nutrients. These fungal filaments \nform extensive networks that can connect separate plants, creating an underground super highway\nfor chemical messages. When a tomato plant responds to blight by acitvating disease-fighting \ngenes and enzymes, signaling molecules produced\nby its immune system can travel to a healthy plant and prompt it to turn on\nits immune system, too. These advance warnings increase\nthe plants chance of survival. Bean plants also eavesdrop\non each other's health through these fungal conduits. An aphid investation in one plant triggers its neighbor to ramp up\nproduction of compounds that repel aphids and attract aphid-eating wasps. If you think of communication\nas an exchange of information, then plants seem to be \nactive communicators. They're sending, receiving, \nand responding to signals without making a sound, and without brains, noses, dictionaries,\nor the Internet. And if we can learn to speak to them\non their terms, we may gain a powerful new tool to protect\ncrops and other valuable species.

Abstract Expressionism started in 1943 and developed after the end of\nWorld War II. It's characterized by large,\nprimarily abstract paintings, all-over compositions \nwithout clear focal points, and sweeping swaths of paint\nembodying and eliciting emotions. The group of artists who are considered\nAbstract Expressionists includes Barnett Newman \nwith his existential zips, Willem de Kooning, famous \nfor his travestied women, Helen Frankenthaler, \nwho created soak-stains, and others. But perhaps the most famous, influential,\nand head-scratching one was Jackson Pollock. Most of his paintings \nare immediately recognizable. They feature tangled messes\nof lines of paint bouncing around in every direction\non the canvas. And sure, these fields of chaos are big\nand impressive, but what's so great about them? Didn't he just drip the paint at random? Can't anyone do that? Well, the answer to these questions\nis both yes and no. While Pollock implemented a technique\nanyone is technically capable of regardless of artistic training, only he could have made his paintings. This paradox relates to his work's roots in the Surrealist automatic drawings\nof André Masson and others. These Surrealists supposedly drew\ndirectly from the unconscious to reveal truths hidden \nwithin their minds. Occasionally, instead of picturing \nsomething and then drawing it, they let their hands move automatically and would later tease out familiar figures\nthat appeared in the scribbles. And after Pollock moved away \nfrom representation, he made drip, or action, paintings\nfollowing a similar premise, though he developed a signature technique and never looked for images or messages\nhidden in the works. First, he took the canvas off of the easel\nand laid it on the floor, a subversive act in itself. Then, in a controlled dance, he stepped\nall around the canvas, dripping industrial paint onto it\nfrom stirrers and other tools, changing speed and direction to control how the paint \nmade contact with the surface. These movements, \nlike the Surrealist scribbles, were supposedly born \nout of Pollock's subconscious. But unlike the Surrealists, whose pictures represented \nthe mind's hidden contents, Pollock's supposedly made physical\nmanifestations of his psyche. His paintings are themselves\nsignatures of his mind. In theory, anyone could make a painting\nthat is an imprint of their mind. So why is Pollock so special? Well, it's important to remember that\nwhile anyone could have done what he did, he and the rest of the New York School\nwere the ones who actually did it. They destroyed conventions of painting\nthat had stood for centuries, forcing the art world to rethink\nthem entirely. But one last reason why Jackson Pollock's\nwork has stayed prominent stems from the specific objects he made,\nwhich embody fascinating contradictions. For instance, while Pollock's process resulted in radically flat \npainted surfaces, the web of painted lines can create\nthe illusion of an infinite layered depth when examined up close. And the chaos of this tangled mess seems\nto defy all control, but it's actually the product\nof a deliberate, though not pre-planned, process. These characteristics made Pollock\ninto a celebrity, and within art history, they also elevated him \nto the mythified status of the genius artist as hero. So rather than evening the playing field\nfor all creative minds, his work unfortunately reinforced\na long-standing elitist aspect of art.

Only if you promise to be really, really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful.\nI will be incredibly careful with it. I promise. So, it's slippery, be careful.\nAlright, are we ready? I'm about to touch a 1kg sphere of silicon-28\natoms. There are about 2.15x10^25 of them. It feels absolutely incredible. Wow, that\nis amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful\nof people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth\n1 million Euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted -- How much is that worth? It's priceless. ... This you are looking at\nnow is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest\nobject? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?\nIf this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain\nto the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros\nand thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'\nas it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for\nthe base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites\nor SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,\ndefined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting\ntemperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the\nLatin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar\nto the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And\nwith the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you\ncouldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,\nliterally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of\nall time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave\nwould be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled\non the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too\nsmall and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented\nthe kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the\nkilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined\nto be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is\ndensest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.\nSo a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition\nand it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the\nkilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives\nis by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded\nto a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was\notherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.\nIt is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately\nknown as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe\nwith a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI\nunit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six\nsister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled\nkeys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts\nof Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault\nand tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition\non which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well\nno, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical\nreplicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was\nslightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent\nout to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a\nweigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were\nmade of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged\nover time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with\nit. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,\ntheir masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of\na fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully\nwashed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually\nchanged the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.\nOne this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this\nis a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.\nAnd the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,\nfour of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like\nNewtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that\nhave not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you\nmay be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer\ndefined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate\nthe kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes\nin, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful\nbut you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.\nWe're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular\nobject is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there\ncan you? You can't count how many are in there but\nyou can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids\nor dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.\nThat's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only\none isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so\nexpensive. And why a sphere?\nWell, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you\ncan characterise the entire dimension of the object.\nWell that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how\ndo you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.\nSo it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively\nfiner and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level\nof trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.\nBut making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.\nThe diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere\nin the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the\ngap. By knowing the diameter you can determine\nits volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can\nthe calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.\nAt the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the\nnumber of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of\nsilicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then\ndefine the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or\ndamaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined\nnot by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition\nof the kilogram say \"a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms\"\nYes. Is it - is it going to happen?\nThere's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.\nBut there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's\nconstant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.\nEach one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to\nbring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram\nas early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined\nby a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.\nNow if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its\ndensest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly\nfour degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two\nways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but\non the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct\nwithin the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want\nto hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I\ncan do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we\nwill have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took\nan international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you\nthink that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some\nof the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been\ninvolved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "If the Avogadro Project's silicon sphere were the earth, how far apart would the highest mountain be from the lowest valley?

They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views\nof over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking,\n\"Why do cats do that?\" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously\nsolitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended\non crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild \nand domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat\nGrizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats \nfor millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure\nand keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points\nto survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular\nskills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room\nfrom the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic\nand hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat \nmany times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat\nstrategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase\nand pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course\nof the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny\nspaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity\nto reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by \nthe same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of\nher species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws\nfor climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces\nkept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else \nyou put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds\nand keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors\ndid in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were \nthe best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert \nat squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding\nin unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers\na clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away \nher location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything \nwe do know about cats, it seems that one of their most \npredominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, \nthe frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote\ntissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo\nan excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr\nis healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators \nthat hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid\nand escaped to survive. So cats today retain many \nof the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild\nfor millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly\nstrange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, \nin our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with\nthem for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able\nto outsmart every day? Or maybe they think we're the prey."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Cats prefer to eat:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less than once a day"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1-2 large meals a day"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Multiple small meals each day"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cats do not have eating preferences"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Cats purr:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When happy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When hungry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "For no reason"}, {"label": "D", "text": "For many reasons"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The best way to understand cat behaviour is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Learn their history"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Watch them play"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Get a cat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cats cannot be understood"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "As prey, cats:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prefer large open areas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Like to hide in small spaces"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Often fight with predators"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cats are not often a prey species"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "As hunters, cats:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Work together in groups"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pursue large prey"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only hunt at night"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Are opportunistic hunters"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

In fact, in October of 2015 alone, about 28 million people visited\na haunted house in the U.S. But many consider \nthis behavior perplexing, asking the question, \"What could possibly be fun \nabout being scared?\" Fear has a bad rap, but it's not all bad. For starters, \nfear can actually feel pretty good. When a threat triggers \nour fight or flight response, our bodies prepare for danger by releasing chemicals that change\nhow our brains and bodies function. This automatic response jumpstarts\nsystems that can aid in survival. They do this by making sure\nwe have enough energy and are protected from feeling pain, while shutting down nonessential systems,\nlike critical thought. Feeling pain-free and energized, while not getting caught up in worrisome \nthoughts that normally occupy our brains, that all sounds great, and it can be because this response\nis similar, though not exactly the same to what we experience in positive,\nhigh-arousal states, like excitement, happiness,\nand even during sex. The difference lays in the context. If we're in real danger, we're focused\non survival, not fun. But when we trigger this high arousal \nresponse in a safe place, we can switch over to enjoying\nthe natural high of being scared. It's why people on roller coasters can go\nfrom screaming to laughing within moments. Your body is already in a euphoric state. You're just relabeling the experience. And though the threat response \nis universal, research shows differences \nbetween individuals in how the chemicals associated\nwith the threat response work. This explains why some are more prone\nto thrill-seeking than others. Other normal physical differences explain why some may love the dizziness\nassociated with a loop-de-loop, while loathing the stomach-drop sensation\nof a steep roller coaster, or why some squeal with delight\ninside a haunted house, but retreat in terror \nif taken to an actual cemetery. Fear brings more \nthan just a fun, natural high. Doing things that we're afraid of\ncan give us a nice boost of self-esteem. Like any personal challenge, whether it's running a race\nor finishing a long book, when we make it through to the end, we feel a sense of accomplishment. This is true even if we know \nwe're not really in any danger. Our thinking brains may know \nthe zombies aren't real, but our bodies tell us otherwise. The fear feels real, so when we make it through alive, the satisfaction and sense \nof accomplishment also feel real. This is a great evolutionary adaptation. Those who had the right balance \nof bravery and wit to know when to push through the fear\nand when to retreat were rewarded with survival, new food, and new lands. Finally, fear can bring people together. Emotions can be contagious, and when you see your friend\nscream and laugh, you feel compelled to do the same. This is because we make sense of what\nour friends are experiencing by recreating the experience ourselves. In fact, the parts of the brain\nthat are active when our friend screams are active in us when we watch them. This not only intensifies \nour own emotional experience, but makes us feel closer \nto those we're with. The feeling of closeness during\ntimes of fear is aided by the hormone oxytocin\nreleased during fight or flight. Fear is a powerful emotional experience, and anything \nthat triggers a strong reaction is going to be stored in our memory\nreally well. You don't want to forget \nwhat can hurt you. So if your memory of watching a horror\nfilm with your friends is positive and left you with a sense of satisfaction, then you'll want to do it over\nand over again."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Our automatic nervous system is responsible for activating the fight or flight response.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "During fight or flight, our body prioritizes ALL the following types of brain and body functioning except for:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Metabolism to produce energy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Endorphins to keep us pain-free"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Critical or cognitive functioning"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The fight or flight response is similar to what other arousal states (select all that apply):", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Excitement"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Surprise"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sexual arousal"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The threat response (fight or flight) is universal, but how individuals experience and interpret the response can very from person to person.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "false"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are the psychological benefits of voluntarily engaging with scary situations?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Boosting self esteem"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sense of accomplishment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Feelings of bravery and courageousness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "We tend to easily forget scary experiences.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You've heard people say, \"It's just like riding a bike\" meaning it's really easy and you can't forget how to do it, right? But I did something. I did something that damaged my mind. It happened on the streets of Amsterdam and I got really scared honestly. I can't ride a bike like you can anymore. Before I show you the video of what happened I need to tell you the back story. Like many six year olds with a MacGyver mullet I learned how to ride a bike when I was really young. I had learned a life skill and I was really proud of it. Everything changed though when my friend Barney called me 25 years later. Where I work, the welders are geniuses, and they like to play jokes on the engineers. He had a challenge for me. He had built a special bicycle and he wanted me to try to ride it. He had only changed one thing. When you turn the handlebar to the left, the wheel goes to the right. When you turn it to the right, the wheel goes to the left. I thought this would be easy so I hopped on the bike ready to demonstrate how quickly I could conquer this. - And here he is ladies and gentlemen, Mr Destin Sandlin. First attempt riding the bicycle. - Yeah, yeah. I couldn't do it. You can see that I'm laughing but I'm actually really frustrated. In this moment I had a really deep revelation. My thinking was in a rut. This bike revealed a very deep truth to me. I had the knowledge of how to operate the bike, but I did not have the understanding. Therefore, knowledge is not understanding. Look I know what you're probably thinking. Destin's probably just an uncoordinated engineer and can't do it. But that's not the case at all. The algorithm that's associated with riding a bike, in your brain, is just that complicated. Think about it. Downwards force on the pedals, leaning your whole body, pulling and pushing the handlebars, gyroscopic procession in the wheels, every single force is part of this algorithm. And if you change any one part it affects the entire control system. I do not make definitive statements that often, but I'm telling you right now, you cannot ride this bicycle. You might think you can, but you can't. I know this because I'm often asked to speak at universities and conferences and I take the bike with me. It's always the same. People think they're gonna try some trick or they're just gonna power through it. It doesn't work. Your brain cannot handle this. For instance, this guy. I offered him two hundred dollars just to ride this bike ten feet across the stage. Everybody thought he could do it. [crowd exclaims] No no no. You didn't understand. So.. this way, not that way. [crowd laughs] Alright so, whenever you're ready. Remember you have to keep your feet on.. [crowd laughs] [laughing crowd] You've gotta start rolling at least. And go. Keep your feet on the pedal, go. [laughing crowd] Just keep your feet on the pedals. Alright, one more time. Once you have a rigid way of thinking in your head, sometimes you cannot change that, even if you want to. So here's what I did. It was a personal challenge. I stayed out here in this driveway and I practiced about 5 minutes every day. My neighbors made fun of me. I had many wrecks. But after 8 months, this happened. One day I couldn't ride the bike, and the next day I could. It was like I could feel some kind of pathway in my brain that was now unlocked. It was really weird though. It's like there's this trail in my brain, but if I wasn't paying close enough attention to it, my brain would easily lose that neural path and jump back onto the old road it was more familiar with. Any small distractions at all, like a cellphone ringing in my pocket, would instantly throw my brain back to the old control algorithm and I would wreck. But at least I could ride it. My son is the closest person to me genetically and he's been riding a normal bike for 3 years, that's over half his life. I wanted to know how long it would take him to learn how to ride a backwards bike so I told him if he learned how to ride a backwards bike he could go with me to Australia and meet a real astronaut. Are you gonna give up? - No. - Go ahead. This is how it starts. Look at this. This is such a big deal. Get up, you got it. Did you see his brain get it? So he, in.. How many weeks we been doing this? Two weeks? In two weeks he did something that took me 8 months to do, which demonstrates that a child has more neural plasticity, am I even saying that right? Than an adult. It's clear from this experiment that children have a much more plastic brain than adults. That's why the best time to learn a language is when you're a young child. Alright, today's bike log. I can ride smooth, I can ride fast. I'm thinking the experiment is over. OK now I'm in Amsterdam, a city that has more bicycles than people. The question is, can I ride a normal bike now. I mean I have spent all this time unlearning how to ride a bike, If I go back and try to ride a normal one will my brain mess up. So I've tweeted a Smarter Every Day.. meetup, if you will. And I'm gonna see if somebody brings a bicycle and I'm gonna try to ride a normal bike. It's backwards, it's backwards. This was one of the most frustrating moments of my life. I had ridden a normal bike since I was six, but in this moment I couldn't do it any more. I had set out to prove that I could free my brain from a cognitive bias, but at this point I'm pretty sure that all I've proved is that I can only re-designate that bias. So what you're not seeing is there's a group of people here, looking at me. Looking at the strange American, that can't ride a bike, cause they think I'm dumb. But I'm actually two levels deep into this, because I've learned and un-learned. Alright. After 20 minutes of making a fool out of myself, suddenly my brain clicked back into the old algorithm. I can't explain it, but it happened in a very specific moment. [laughter] I've got it, I've got it, I've got it. I'm back. Oh it clicked. It clicked. I've got it, I've got it. OK there it is. There was the moment. OK I can ride a bike. I tried to explain this to the people around me, and they just didn't get it. They thought I was faking the previous 20 minutes and I couldn't get anybody to believe me. That looked like I faked it, didn't it. You think I'm faking. You don't believe me. - It looked so weird... - You think I'm lying don't you. I'm not lying. I felt like the only person on the planet who had ever un-learned how to ride a bike, and I couldn't articulate it to anyone because everybody just knew that you can't forget how to ride a bike. So I learned 3 things from this experiment. I learned that welders are often smarter than engineers, I learned that knowledge does not equal understanding, and I learned that truth is truth. No matter what I think about it. So be very careful how you interpret things because you're looking at the world with a bias whether you think you are or not. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day, have a good one. OK if you wanna support Smarter Every Day you can download a free audio book at audible.com/smarter I recommend Commander Hadfield's book which is An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. I read it, it was awesome. If you think about it, I had to learn how to ride a different kind of bicycle and my son did it as well, but Commander Hadfield had to learn how to ride a different space ship. Not only that, but a different type of space station. He was on Mir and the International Space Station. Anyway, if you're interested in supporting Smarter Every Day, audible.com/smarter, An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. [crowd cheers] Everything is wrong... My instinctive reaction is wrong. (Destin) Why don't you ride it? You just build it? - I can't ride it, I just build it.

Sotomayor", "category": "Growth & Development", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-surprising-reason-you-feel-awful-when-you-re-sick-marco-a-sotomayor", "transcript": {"en": "It starts with a tickle in your throat\nthat becomes a cough. Your muscles begin to ache, you grow irritable, and you lose your appetite. It's official: you've got the flu. It's logical to assume that this\nmiserable medley of symptoms is the result of the infection\ncoursing through your body, but is that really the case? What's actually making you feel sick? What if your body itself\nwas driving this vicious onslaught? You first get ill when a pathogen\nlike the flu virus gets into your system, infecting and killing your cells. But this unwelcome intrusion \nhas another effect: it alerts your body's immune system\nto your plight. As soon as it becomes aware of infection,\nyour body leaps to your defense. Cells called macrophages charge in\nas the first line of attack, searching for and destroying the viruses\nand infected cells. Afterwards, the macrophages release\nprotein molecules called cytokines whose job is to recruit and organize more virus-busting cells \nfrom your immune system. If this coordinated effort \nis strong enough, it'll wipe out the infection\nbefore you even notice it. But that's just your body setting\nthe scene for some real action. In some cases, viruses spread further, even into the blood and vital organs. To avoid this sometimes dangerous fate, your immune system must launch\na stronger attack, coordinating its activity with the brain. That's where those unpleasant symptoms\ncome in, starting with the surging temperature, aches and pains, and sleepiness. So why do we experience this? When the immune system is under\nserious attack, it secretes more cytokines, which trigger two responses. First, the vagus nerve, which runs through\nthe body into the brain, quickly transmits the information\nto the brain stem, passing near an important area\nof pain processing. Second, cytokines travel through\nthe body to the hypothalamus, the part of the brain responsible\nfor controlling temperature, thirst, hunger, and sleep, among other things. When it receives this message, the hypothalamus produces\nanother molecule called prostaglandin E2,\nwhich gears it up for war. The hypothalamus sends signals\nthat instruct your muscles to contract and causes a rise in body temperature. It also makes you sleepy, and you lose your appetite and thirst. But what's the point of all of these\nunpleasant symptoms? Well, we're not yet sure, but some theorize that they aid\nin recovery. The rise in temperature can slow bacteria and help your immune system\ndestroy pathogens. Sleep lets your body channel\nmore energy towards fighting infection. When you stop eating, your liver can\ntake up much of the iron in your blood, and since iron is essential \nfor bacterial survival, that effectively starves them. Your reduced thirst makes \nyou mildly dehydrated, diminishing transmission through sneezes, coughs, vomit, or diarrhea. Though it's worth noting that if you don't\ndrink enough water, that dehydration can become dangerous. Even the body's aches \nmake you more sensitive, drawing attention to infected cuts\nthat might be worsening, or even causing your condition. In addition to physical symptoms, sickness can also make you irritable, sad, and confused. That's because cytokines and prostaglandin can reach even higher structures \nin your brain, disrupting the activity \nof neurotransmitters, like glutamate, endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. This affects areas like the limbic system,\nwhich oversees emotions, and your cerebral cortex,\nwhich is involved in reasoning. So it's actually the body's own\nimmune response that causes much of the discomfort\nyou feel every time you get ill. Unfortunately, it doesn't always\nwork perfectly. Most notably, millions of people\nworldwide suffer from autoimmune diseases, in which the immune system treats\nnormal bodily cues as threats, so the body attacks itself. But for the majority of the human race, millions of years of evolution\nhave fine-tuned the immune system so that it works for, \nrather than against us.
