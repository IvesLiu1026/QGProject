It's just one of the many thousands\nof tasks performed by the muscular system. This network of over 650 muscles\ncovers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. It's even responsible for \nthe heart's dependable thump. First, what exactly \nis the muscular system? It's made up of three main muscle types: skeletal muscle, which attaches\nvia tendons to our bones, cardiac muscle, which is only\nfound in the heart, and smooth muscle, which lines\nthe blood vessels and certain organs, like the intestine and uterus. All three types are \nmade up of muscle cells, also known as fibers,\nbundled tightly together. These bundles receive signals from\nthe nervous system that contract the fibers, which in turn\ngenerates force and motion. This produces almost all\nthe movements we make. Some of the only parts of the body whose motions aren't governed \nby the muscular system are sperm cells, the hair-like cilia in our airways, and certain white blood cells. Muscle contraction can be split\ninto three main types. The first two, shortening muscle fibers\nand lengthening them, generate opposing forces. So the biceps will shorten\nwhile the triceps will lengthen or relax, pulling up the arm and making it \nbend at the elbow. This allows us to, say, pick up a book, or if the muscle relationship \nis reversed, put it down. This complementary partnership\nexists throughout the muscular system. The third type of contraction\ncreates a stabilizing force. In these cases, the muscle fibers\ndon't change in length, but instead keep the muscles rigid. This allows us to grip a mug of coffee\nor lean against a wall. It also maintains our posture\nby holding us upright. Skeletal muscles form the bulk\nof the muscular system, make up about 30-40% of the body's weight, and generate most of its motion. Some muscles are familiar to us,\nlike the pectorals and the biceps. Others may be less so,\nlike the buccinator, a muscle that attaches your cheek\nto your teeth, or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle, a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment\ncalled the stapedius that's nestled deep inside the ear. Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are\nconnected to the somatic nervous system, which gives us almost complete control\nover their movements. This muscle group also contains\ntwo types of muscle fibers to refine our motions even further,\nslow-twitch and fast-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers react instantly\nwhen triggered but quickly use up their energy\nand tire out. Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,\nare endurance cells. They react and use energy slowly\nso they can work for longer periods. A sprinter will accumulate more\nfast-twitch muscles in her legs through continuous practice, enabling her to quickly, if briefly,\npick up the pace, whereas back muscles contain \nmore slow-twitch muscles to maintain your posture all day. Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's\ncardiac and smooth muscles are managed by \nthe autonomic nervous system beyond our direct control. That makes your heart thump\nroughly 3 billion times over the course of your life, which supplies the body \nwith blood and oxygen. Autonomic control also contracts\nand relaxes smooth muscle in a rhythmic cycle. That pumps blood through the smooth\ninternal walls of blood vessels, enables the intestine to constrict and\npush food through the digestive system, and allows the uterus to contract\nwhen a person is giving birth. As muscles work, they also use energy\nand produce an important byproduct, heat. In fact, muscle provides \nabout 85% of your warmth, which the heart and blood vessels\nthen spread evenly across the body via the blood. Without that, we couldn't maintain\nthe temperature necessary for our survival. The muscular system \nmay be largely invisible to us, but it leaves its mark on almost\neverything we do, whether it's the blink of an eye\nor a race to the finish line."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What type of muscle makes up the muscular system?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Skeletal muscle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cardiac muscle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Smooth muscle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Fast twitch muscle cells:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Use energy slowly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Would be abundant in the muscles of a sprinter"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Have lots of nerve cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Help us to stand upright"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "One type of muscle contraction results in a stabilizing force.

Mystified by these cyclops sheep, they called in scientists from the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture to investigate. The researchers hypothesized\nthat the pregnant ewes had snacked on poisonous \nbirth defect-causing plants. They collected the local flora\nand fed samples to lab rats, but struggled to replicate the effect. So they decided \nto directly observe the sheep with one scientist even living\nwith the herd for three summers. After a decade of trial and error,\nthe scientists finally found the culprit, wild corn lilies. The lilies contained an active molecule\nwith six connected rings that they named cyclopamine\nin reference to the cyclops sheep. They didn't know exactly\nhow cyclopamine caused the defect but told ranchers to steer clear. It took about four decades before\na team of biologists, led by Professor Philip Beachy, stumbled upon the answer. His lab was studying a specific gene\nfound in many species, from mice to humans, called the hedgehog gene. It was named by two scientists, who later\nshared the Noble Prize for their work, who found that mutating \nthis gene in fruit flies produced pointy spikes like a hedgehog. Beachy and his colleagues performed\ngenetic modifications to turn off the hedgehog genes in mice. This resulted in severe defects \nin the development of their brains, organs, and eyes or, rather, eye. Then while perusing a textbook, Beachy \ncame across photos of the cyclops sheep and realized what had eluded scientists\nfor four decades. Something must have gone awry \ninvolving the hedgehog gene. Let's take a step back. Genes contain instructions that tell\ncells what to do and when to do it, and they communicate their directives\nusing proteins. The hedgehog gene itself tells cells\nto release a so-called hedgehog protein, which kicks off a complex \nseries of cellular signals. Here's how it works in normal\nhealthy development. Hedgehog protein latches on to\na protein called patched. That inhibits, or holds, patched back, allowing another protein called\nsmoothened to freely signal the cells, telling them where to go\nand what kind of tissues to become. Cyclopamine, say in the form \nof a delicious corn lily, interrupts this pathway\nby binding onto smoothened. That locks smoothened up so that\nit's unable to send the signals needed to mold the brain \ninto two hemispheres, and form fingers or separate eyes. So even though the hedgehog\nprotein is still doing its job of keeping the way clear for smoothened, cyclopamine blocks smoothened\nfrom passing along its chemical message. That settled the science\nbehind the one-eyed sheep, but Beachy and his team \ncaught the glimmer of another more beneficial connection. They noted that uncontrolled activation\nof the smoothened protein was associated with a human syndrome. It's known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome,\nand it predisposes people to certain cancers. The scientists proposed putting cyclopamine's smoothened \nbinding powers to good use as a treatment for these cancers, as long as the patient wasn't pregnant. Unfortunately, researchers eventually\nfound that cyclopamine causes negative side effects, and its chemical properties\nmake it difficult to work with. But they did discover that closely\nrelated molecules are safe and effective, and two of these drugs were approved\nin 2012 and 2015 as skin cancer medicines. When those farmers first saw\nthe cyclops sheep, they could have chalked it up to\na freak genetic mutation and walked away. Instead, their decision to investigate\nturned a mystery into medicine showing that sometimes\nthere's more than meets the eye."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Scientists discovered that the cyclops sheep deformity was caused by pregnant ewes eating:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Grass"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Berries"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wild corn lilies"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fruit flies"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Two scientists won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the hedgehog gene.

From outlawed religious tracts\nand revolutionary manifestos to censored and burned books, we know the potential power\nof words to overturn the social order. But as strange as it may seem, some numbers have also been considered\ndangerous enough to ban. Our distant ancestors long counted\nobjects using simple tally marks. But as they developed agriculture and\nbegan living together in larger groups, this was no longer enough. As numbers grew more complex, people began not just using them,\nbut thinking about what they are and how they work. And by 600 B.C.E. in Ancient Greece,\nthe study of numbers was well-developed. The mathematician Pythagoras\nand his school of followers found numerical patterns in shapes,\nmusic, and the stars. For them, mathematics held \nthe deepest secrets of the universe. But one Pythagorean named Hippasus\ndiscovered something disturbing. Some quantities, like the diagonal\nof a square with sides of length one couldn't be expressed by any combination\nof whole numbers or fractions, no matter how small. These numbers, \nwhich we call irrational numbers, were perceived as a threat to the Pythagorean's notion \nof a perfect universe. They imagined a reality \nthat could be described with rational, numerical patterns. Historians write that Hippasus\nwas exhiled for publicizing his findings, while legends claim he was drowned\nas punishment from the gods. While irrational numbers \nupset philosophers, later mathematical inventions\nwould draw attention from political \nand religious authorities, as well. In the Middle Ages, while Europe\nwas still using Roman numerals, other cultures had developed \npositional systems that included a symbol for zero. When Arab travelers brought this system\nto the bustling maritime cities of Italy, its advantages for merchants\nand bankers was clear. But the authorities were more wary. Hindu-Arabic numerals were considered\neasier to forge or alter, especially since they were less\nfamiliar to customers than to merchants. And the concept of zero opened \nthe door to negative numbers and the recording of debt at a time when moneylending\nwas regarded with suspicion. In the 13th century, Florence banned\nthe use of Hindu-Arabic numerals for record keeping. And though they soon proved\ntoo useful to ignore, controversies over zero \nand negative numbers continued for a long time. Negative numbers \nwere dismissed as absurd well into the 19th century. And prominent mathematicians,\nlike Gerolamo Cardano, avoided using zero, even though it would have made it\nmuch easier to find solutions to cubic and the quartic equations. Even today it's illegal to use\nsome numbers for different reasons. Some are banned because\nof what they represent. For example, governments\nhave prohibited the display of numbers that have symbolic meaning, such as the date of a revolution or connections to oppositional \npolitical figures or parties. Other numbers are potentially illegal\nbecause of the information they carry. Just about any information, whether text, image, video, or executable programs can\nbe translated into a string of numbers. But this means that protected information, whether copyrights, proprietary materials, or state secrets can also be represented as numbers, so possessing or publishing these numbers\nmay be treated as a criminal offense. This idea gathered attention in 2001 when code that could be used\nto decrypt DVDs was widely shared and distributed\nin the form of a large prime number. The idea of illegal numbers \nmay sound absurd, but like words, written numbers are a way\nof expressing concepts and information. And in a world where calculations \nand algorithms shape more and more of our lives, the mathematician's pencil\ngrows stronger by the day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Our distant ancestors counted objects using:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tally marks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Roman numerals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fingers and toes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fractions"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is a rational number?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The length of the diagonal of a square with side-length of 1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A number that cannot be expressed as the ratio of two quantities"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A perfect number"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A number that can be expressed as a ratio of two quantities"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who were the Pythagoreans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People who discovered and proved the Pythagorean theorem"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Merchants and bankers who used Pythagoras’ mathematics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mathematician-philosophers who were members of Pythagoras’ school"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ancient Greeks who studied mathematics"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why were Arabic numerals banned for record-keeping in Florence?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they were unfamiliar to most people"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because they were not useful"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because they were illegible"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because they were regarded as easy to adjust fraudulently"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why today it is illegal to use some numbers in some countries?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because they may have symbolic meaning"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because they carry copyrighted information"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because they carry otherwise protected information"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

How do you know it's really yours? It seems obvious, unless you've\nexperienced the rubber hand illusion. In this experiment, a dummy hand is placed\nin front of you and your real hand is hidden\nbehind a screen. Both are simultaneously stroked\nwith a paint brush. No matter how much you remind yourself\nthe dummy hand isn't yours, you eventually start to feel like it is, and inevitably flinch\nwhen it's threatened with a knife. That may just be a temporary trick,\nbut it speaks to a larger truth: our bodies, the physical, \nbiological parts of us, and our minds, the thinking,\nconscious aspects, have a complicated, tangled relationship. Which one primarily defines you\nor your self? Are you a physical body that only\nexperiences thoughts and emotions as a result of biochemical interactions\nin the brain? That would be a body with a mind. Or is there some non-physical part of you\nthat's pulling the strings but could live outside \nof your biological body? That would be a mind with a body. That takes us to an old question of whether the body \nand mind are two separate things. In a famous thought experiment, 16th-century philosopher \nRené Descartes pointed out that even if all our physical sensations\nwere just a hallucinatory dream, our mind and thoughts \nwould still be there. That, for him, was the ultimate proof\nof our existence. And it led him to conclude that the conscious mind is something separate\nfrom the material body that forms the core of our identity. The notion of a non-physical consciousness echoes the belief of many religions\nin an immaterial soul for which the body is only \na temporary shell. If we accept this, \nanother problem emerges. How can a non-physical mind have\nany interaction with the physical body? If the mind has no shape, \nweight, or motion, how can it move your muscles? Or if we assume it can, why can your mind\nonly move your body and not others? Some thinkers have found creative ways\nto get around this dilemma. For example, the French priest \nand philosopher Nicolas Malebranche claimed that when we think about\nreaching for a fork, it's actually god who moves our hand. Another priest philosopher \nnamed George Berkeley concluded that the material world\nis an illusion, existing only as mental perceptions. This question of mind versus body\nisn't just the domain of philosophers. With the development of psychology\nand neuroscience, scientists have weighed in, as well. Many modern scientists reject the idea that there's any distinction \nbetween the mind and body. Neuroscience suggests that our bodies,\nalong with their physical senses, are deeply integrated \nwith the activity in our brains to form what we call consciousness. From the day we're born, our mental development is formed\nthrough our body's interaction with the external world. Every sight, sound, and touch create\nnew maps and representations in the brain that eventually become responsible\nfor regulating our experience of self. And we have other senses,\nbesides the typical five, such as the sense of balance and a sense of the relative location\nof our body parts. The rubber hand illusion,\nand similar virtual reality experiments, show that our senses can easily\nmislead us in our judgment of self. They also suggest that our bodies\nand external sensations are inseparable from \nour subjective consciousness. If this is true, then perhaps Descartes'\nexperiment was mistaken from the start. After all, if we close our eyes\nin a silent room, the feeling of having a body\nisn't something we can just imagine away. This question of mind and body\nbecomes particularly interesting at a time when we're considering\nfuture technologies, such as neural prosthetics\nand wearable robots that could become extended parts\nof our bodies. Or the slightly more radical idea\nof mind uploading, which dangles the possibility \nof immortal life without a body by transferring a human consciousness\ninto a computer. If the body is deeply mapped\nin the brain, then by extending our sense of self\nto new wearable devices, our brains may eventually adapt\nto a restructured version with new sensory representations. Or perhaps uploading our consciousness\ninto a computer might not even be possible unless we can also simulate a body\ncapable of delivering physical sensations. The idea that our bodies are part\nof our consciousness and vice versa also isn't new. It's found extensively \nin Buddhist thought, as well as the writings of philosophers\nfrom Heidegger to Aristotle. But for now, we're still left\nwith the open question of what exactly our self is. Are we a mind equipped with\na physical body as Descartes suggested? Or a complex organism \nthat's gained consciousness over millions of years of evolution thanks to a bigger brain and\nmore neurons than our distant ancestors? Or something else entirely that\nno one's yet dreamt up?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In the rubber hand illusion, the dummy hand feels like the viewer’s real hand because of the synchronization between two sensory inputs from both hands.

{"page": 90, "lesson": 5, "title": "Should we get rid of standardized testing? - Arlo Kempf", "category": "Education Policy", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/should-we-get-rid-of-standardized-testing-arlo-kempf", "transcript": {"en": "The first standardized tests \nthat we know of were administered in China \nover 2,000 years ago during the Han dynasty. Chinese officials used them to determine\naptitude for various government posts. The subject matter included philosophy, farming, and even military tactics. Standardized tests continued to be used\naround the world for the next two millennia, and today, they're used for everything from evaluating stair climbs\nfor firefighters in France to language examinations \nfor diplomats in Canada to students in schools. Some standardized tests measure scores only in relation to the results \nof other test takers. Others measure performances on how well\ntest takers meet predetermined criteria. So the stair climb for the firefighter could be measured by comparing \nthe time of the climb to that of all other firefighters. This might be expressed in what \nmany call a bell curve. Or it could be evaluated with reference\nto set criteria, such as carrying a certain amount \nof weight a certain distance up a certain number of stairs. Similarly, the diplomat might be measured\nagainst other test-taking diplomats, or against a set of fixed criteria, which demonstrate different levels\nof language proficiency. And all of these results can be expressed\nusing something called a percentile. If a diplomat is in the 70th percentile,\n70% of test takers scored below her. If she scored in the 30th percentile,\n70% of test takers scored above her. Although standardized tests \nare sometimes controversial, they're simply a tool. As a thought experiment, \nthink of a standardized test as a ruler. A ruler's usefulness \ndepends on two things. First, the job we ask it to do. Our ruler can't measure \nthe temperature outside or how loud someone is singing. Second, the ruler's usefulness depends\non its design. Say you need to measure the circumference\nof an orange. Our ruler measures length,\nwhich is the right quantity, but it hasn't been designed with the \nflexibility required for the task at hand. So, if standardized tests are given\nthe wrong job, or aren't designed properly, they may end up measuring\nthe wrong things. In the case of schools, students with test anxiety may have \ntrouble performing their best on a standardized test, not because they don't know the answers, but because they're feeling too nervous\nto share what they've learned. Students with reading challenges may struggle with the wording \nof a math problem, so their test results may better reflect\ntheir literacy rather than numeracy skills. And students who were confused by examples on tests that contain \nunfamiliar cultural references may do poorly, telling us more about the test taker's\ncultural familiarity than their academic learning. In these cases, the tests may need\nto be designed differently. Standardized tests can also \nhave a hard time measuring abstract \ncharacteristics or skills, such as creativity, critical thinking,\nand collaboration. If we design a test poorly, or ask it to do the wrong job, or a job it's not very good at, the results may not be reliable or valid. Reliability and validity \nare two critical ideas for understanding standardized tests. To understand the difference between them, we can use the metaphor \nof two broken thermometers. An unreliable thermometer gives you a different reading \neach time you take your temperature, and the reliable but invalid thermometer\nis consistently ten degrees too hot. Validity also depends on accurate\ninterpretations of results. If people say results of a test\nmean something they don't, that test may have a validity problem. Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler\nto tell us how much an elephant weighs, or what it had for breakfast, we can't expect standardized tests alone\nto reliably tell us how smart someone is, how diplomats will handle\na tough situation, or how brave a firefighter \nmight turn out to be. So standardized tests may help us learn\na little about a lot of people in a short time, but they usually can't tell us a lot\nabout a single person. Many social scientists worry about\ntest scores resulting in sweeping and often negative changes\nfor test takers, sometimes with long-term \nlife consequences. We can't blame the tests, though. It's up to us to use the right tests\nfor the right jobs, and to interpret results appropriately."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where and for what are standardized tests thought to have been first used?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In China, over 2000 years ago, to assess applicants for government jobs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In France, over 2000 years ago, to assess the language skills of politicians"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In Canada, 50 years ago, to assess firefighters climbing stairs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In the US, in 2017, to assess TED-Ed videos"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Standardized tests can be used for the following:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To measure the test taker against other test takers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To measure the test taker against predetermined criteria"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To measure the test taker against a predetermined standard"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If you score in the 25th percentile on a test, what percentage of test takers scored above you?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "24%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "75%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If a scale provides reliable but invalid results, which of the following is possible?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A measurement that is sometimes 5 kilos over and sometimes 5 kilos under"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A measurement that is always 10 kilos over"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A measurement that is sometimes 5 kilos over and sometimes 5 kilos under or a measurement that is always 10 kilos over"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A measurement that is always 1 kilo under"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A measurement that is sometimes 5 kilos over and sometimes 10 kilos over"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If a scale provides unreliable results, which of the following is possible?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A measurement that is sometimes correct"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A measurement that is always 5 kilos over"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A measurement that is always five kilos under"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A measurement that is always correct"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

His Emancipation Proclamation \nwasn't a law, or a presidential decree. It was an executive order. The framers of the American Constitution\nmade the power of executive order available to the executive branch. But what exactly is this tool? How does it work? And what is the extent of its power? Well, an executive order isn't a law,\nbut it can carry the weight of one. Passing laws involves \na fairly lengthy process. First, a member of Congress proposes\na piece of legislation in the form of a bill. After many committees and revisions, if the bill is approved \nby a majority votes in Congress, that is both the House and Senate, the bill is then sent to \nthe president for signature. If the president signs the bill,\nit then becomes a law. An executive order, on the other hand, is something the president issues\nwithout consultation or permission from Congress. They are, however, enforced like laws, and are subject to judicial review\nby the court system to make sure they're within the limits\nof the Constitution. That means the courts have the power\nto invalidate any executive decisions that they determine are an overreach of\nthe president in trying to assert power. And once the president leaves office, if his or her successor wants to eliminate\nthe executive order, they can do so. So when does a president \nuse an executive order? Sometimes a president feels the need to\nexert power without working with Congress, and in times of crisis, quick decisions\ncan be justified. But most executive orders are not \nresponses to emergencies. They're often directed towards\nagencies in the federal government in order to expand \nor contract their power. Others determine the extent\nto which legislation should be enforced. And sometimes, a president may use\nan executive order to clarify and help implement a policy\nthat needs to be easily defined. Some of the most famous executive orders have changed the course \nof American history. FDR issued an executive order to establish\nthe Works Progress Administration, which helped build thousands of roads,\nbridges, and parks throughout the country. The WPA also employed \nthousands of writers, painters, sculptors, and artists to create works of art\nin public spaces. Additionally, Harry Truman used\nan executive order to desegregate the armed forces in 1948. And in 1965, Lyndon Johnson signed\nan executive order to establish requirements \nfor nondiscriminatory practices in hiring and employment. Executive orders have often been used\nin positive and inclusive ways, but they've also been used \nto exclude and divide. One of the most notable examples being\nFDR's 1942 executive order. He gave the military authority to target\npredominantly Japanese-Americans, as well as German-Americans\nand Italian-Americans, in certain regions across the country. This executive order also removed any or\nall of those people into military zones, most commonly known as internment camps. Beginning in the early 1960s, each president has issued \nroughly 300 executive orders, but FDR issued over 3,500. At the other end of the spectrum, William Henry Harrison never issued\nan executive order, probably because his presidency only\nlasted 31 days. The U.S. Constitution is somewhat ambiguous\non the extent of the president's power. That's resulted in executive orders\nexpanding over time. For instance, since Lyndon Johnson, presidents have begun issuing orders\nto create faith-based initiatives, establish federal agencies, and remove barriers \nfor scientific research. There are checks and balances \nin the U.S. political system. Congress can pass laws to counteract\nexecutive orders, and judges can halt them by deeming them\nunconstitutional. But in the time it takes \nfor those things to happen, an executive order can go into effect and possibly change the course of history,\nfor better or for worse."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Framers made executive orders available to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Legislative branch only"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Executive and Legislative branches"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Executive branch only"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Judicial branch only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All three branches of government"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In 1863, Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States, signed an executive order changing the status of 3 million blacks in America.

Stuver", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-are-gravitational-waves-amber-l-stuver", "transcript": {"en": "At about six o'clock in the morning\non September 14, 2015, scientists witnessed something\nno human had ever seen: two black holes colliding. Both about 30 times as massive\nas our Sun, they had been orbiting each other\nfor millions of years. As they got closer together, they circled each other faster and faster. Finally, they collided and merged\ninto a single, even bigger, black hole. A fraction of a second before their crash, they sent a vibration across the universe\nat the speed of light. And on Earth, billions of years later, a detector called the Laser Interferometer\nGravitational Wave Observatory, or LIGO for short, picked it up. The signal only lasted a fifth of a second and was the detector's first observation\nof gravitational waves. What are these ripples in space? The answer starts with gravity, the force that pulls any \ntwo objects together. That's the case for everything\nIn the observable universe. You're pulling on the Earth,\nthe Moon, the Sun, and every single star, and they're pulling on you. The more mass something has,\nthe stronger its gravitational pull. The farther away the object,\nthe lower its pull. If every mass has an effect\non every other mass in the universe, no matter how small, then changes in gravity can tell us\nabout what those objects are doing. Fluctuations in the gravity\ncoming from the universe are called gravitational waves. Gravitational waves move out from \nwhat caused them, like ripples on a pond, getting smaller as they travel farther\nfrom their center. But what are they ripples on? When Einstein devised \nhis Theory of Relativity, he imagined gravity as a curve\nin a surface called space-time. A mass in space creates a depression\nin space-time, and a ball rolling across a depression\nwill curve like it's being attracted \nto the other mass. The bigger the mass, the deeper the depression\nand the stronger the gravity. When the mass making the depression moves,\nthat sends out ripples in space-time. These are gravitationl waves. What would a gravitational wave feel like? If our bodies were sensitive enough\nto detect them, we'd feel like we were \nbeing stretched sideways while being compressed vertically. And in the next instant, stretched up and down \nwhile being compressed horizontally, sideways, then up and down. This back and forth would happen\nover and over as the gravitational wave\npassed right through you. But this happens on such a minute scale\nthat we can't feel any of it. So we've built detectors \nthat can feel it for us. That's what the LIGO detectors do. And they're not the only ones. There are gravitational wave detectors\nspread across the world. These L-shaped instruments have long arms, whose exact length \nis measured with lasers. If the length changes, it could be because\ngravitational waves are stretching and compressing the arms. Once the detectors feel \na gravitational wave, scientists can extract information\nabout the wave's source. In a way, detectors like LIGO are\nbig gravitational wave radios. Radio waves are traveling all around you,\nbut you can't feel them or hear the music they carry. It takes the right kind of \ndetector to extract the music. LIGO detects a gravitational wave signal, which scientists then study for data\nabout the object that generated it. They can derive information, \nlike its mass and the shape of its orbit. We can also hear gravitational waves\nby playing their signals through speakers, just like the music a radio extracts\nfrom radio waves. So those two black holes colliding\nsounds like this. Scientists call this \nslide whistle-like noise a chirp, and it's the signature of any two\nobjects orbiting into each other. The black hole collision \nwas just one example of what gravitational waves can tell us. Other high-energy astronomical events\nwill leave gravitational echoes, too. The collapse of a star before it\nexplodes in a supernova, or a very dense neutron stars colliding. Every time we create a new tool\nto look at space, we discover something we didn't expect, something that might revolutionize\nour understanding of the universe. LIGO's no different. In the short time it's been on, LIGO's already revealed surprises, like that black holes collide\nmore often than we ever expected. It's impossible to say, \nbut exciting to imagine, what revelations may now be propagating\nacross space towards our tiny blue planet and\nits new way of perceiving the universe."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is true about the pull of gravity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Earth is pulling on you"}, {"label": "B", "text": "You are pulling on the Earth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The more mass you have, the stronger your pull"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The further away you are, the weaker your pull"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above are true"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "When two black holes crash together, what happens?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They stick together to make a bigger black hole"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They destroy each other and there is no black hole remaining"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They bounce off of each other"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They smash each other into many smaller black holes"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements is false about space-time?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Space-time is a way to describe the strength of gravity in terms of a curved surface"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Space-time is a way to describe the strength of gravity in terms of a curved surface"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The size of the object, not the mass, determines the curvature of space-time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The greater the curvature of space-time, the stronger the pull of gravity"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How is a gravitational-wave detector like LIGO similar to a radio?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "LIGO is used to play music from alien radio stations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Both LIGO and radios are detectors used to extract information from a wave"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Radios can be used to detect gravitational waves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "LIGO must be tuned to a single frequency like a radio is tuned to a single station"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If a gravitational wave was strong enough for you to feel, what would it feel like?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Like hot and cold flashes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Like a tingling sensation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Like being stretched in one direction and compressed in another"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Like being twisted back and forth"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 90, "lesson": 8, "title": "Where do new words come from? - Marcel Danesi", "category": "Linguistics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/where-do-new-words-come-from-marcel-danesi", "transcript": {"en": "Every year, about 1,000 new words are\nadded to the Oxford English Dictionary. Where do they come from, and how do they make it \ninto our everyday lives? With over 170,000 words currently in use\nin the English language, it might seem we already have plenty. Yet, as our world changes, new ideas and inventions spring forth, and science progresses, our existing words leave gaps\nin what we want to express and we fill those gaps \nin several ingenious, practical, and occasionally peculiar ways. One way is to absorb a word\nfrom another language. English has borrowed so many words\nover its history that nearly half of its vocabulary \ncomes directly from other languages. Sometimes, this is simply because\nthe thing the word describes was borrowed itself. Rome and France brought legal\nand religious concepts, like altar and jury, to Medieval England, while trade brought crops and cuisine, like Arabic coffee, Italian spaghetti, and Indian curry. But sometimes, another language \nhas just the right word for a complex idea or emotion, like naïveté machismo, or schadenfreude. Scientists also use classical languages\nto name new concepts. Clone, for example, was derived from\nthe Ancient Greek word for twig to describe creating a new plant\nfrom a piece of the old. And today, the process works both ways, with English lending words like software\nto languages all over the world. Another popular way \nto fill a vocabulary gap is by combining existing words that each\nconvey part of the new concept. This can be done by combining two\nwhole words into a compound word, like airport or starfish, or by clipping and blending parts of words\ntogether, like spork, brunch, or internet. And unlike borrowings \nfrom other languages, these can often be understood\nthe first time you hear them. And sometimes a new word isn't new at all. Obsolete words gain new life by adopting\nnew meanings. Villain originally meant a peasant farmer,\nbut in a twist of aristocratic snobbery came to mean someone not bound\nby the knightly code of chivalry and, therefore, a bad person. A geek went from \nbeing a carnival performer to any strange person to a specific type of awkward genius. And other times, words come to mean\ntheir opposite through irony, metaphor, or misuse, like when sick or wicked are used\nto describe something literally amazing. But if words can be formed \nin all these ways, why do some become mainstream\nwhile others fall out of use or never catch on in the first place? Sometimes, the answer is simple, as when scientists or companies \ngive an official name to a new discovery or technology. And some countries have language academies\nto make the decisions. But for the most part, official sources\nlike dictionaries only document current usage. New words don't originate from above,\nbut from ordinary people spreading words that \nhit the right combination of useful and catchy. Take the word meme, coined in the 1970s \nby sociobiologist Richard Dawkins from the Ancient Greek for imitation. He used it to describe how ideas\nand symbols propagate through a culture like genes through a population. With the advent of the Internet, the process became directly observable\nin how jokes and images were popularized at lightning speed. And soon, the word came to refer\nto a certain kind of image. So meme not only describes how words\nbecome part of language, the word is a meme itself. And there's a word for this phenomenon\nof words that describe themselves: autological. Not all new words are created equal. Some stick around for millennia, some adapt to changing times, and others die off. Some relay information, some interpret it, but the way these words are created and the journey they take to become\npart of our speech tells us a lot about our world\nand how we communicate within it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "One way a word enters a language is by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Borrowing it from another language"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cloning an existing word"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Luck"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eliminating another word"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Scientists sometimes use ______ to name a new idea.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An already-existing term"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A synonym"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Words from a classical language"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Random phonetic sounds"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "A way to fill-in a conceptual gap in a language is to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ignore it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Combine existing words"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Look up a new word"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Guess"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The word meme came about through:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Analogy with the word gene"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Borrowing from another language"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A dictionary look-up process"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Speculation"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Obsolete words can gain new life:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because of nostalgia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Through a whim"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By legislation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By giving them new meanings"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 90, "lesson": 9, "title": "The life cycle of a t-shirt - Angel Chang", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-life-cycle-of-a-t-shirt-angel-chang", "transcript": {"en": "Consider the classic white t-shirt. Annually, we sell and buy\ntwo billion t-shirts globally, making it one of the most common\ngarments in the world. But how and where is the average\nt-shirt made, and what's its environmental impact? Clothing items can vary a lot, but a typical t-shirt begins its life\non a farm in America, China, or India where cotton seeds are sown, irrigated and\ngrown for the fluffy bolls they produce. Self-driving machines carefully harvest\nthese puffs, an industrial cotton gin mechanically\nseparates the fluffy bolls from the seeds, and the cotton lint is pressed \ninto 225-kilogram bales. The cotton plants require a huge quantity\nof water and pesticides. 2,700 liters of water are needed to produce\nthe average t-shirt, enough to fill more than 30 bathtubs. Meanwhile, cotton uses more insecticides\nand pesticides than any other crop in the world. These pollutants can be carcinogenic, harm the health of field workers, and damage surrounding ecosystems. Some t-shirts are made of organic cotton\ngrown without pesticides and insecticides, but organic cotton makes up less than 1% of the 22.7 million metric tons \nof cotton produced worldwide. Once the cotton bales leave the farm, textile mills ship them\nto a spinning facility, usually in China or India, where high-tech machines blend, card, comb, pull, stretch, and, finally, twist the cotton into\nsnowy ropes of yarn called slivers. Then, yarns are sent to the mill, where huge circular knitting machines weave them into sheets \nof rough grayish fabric treated with heat and chemicals\nuntil they turn soft and white. Here, the fabric is dipped into\ncommercial bleaches and azo dyes, which make up the vivid coloring\nin about 70% of textiles. Unfortunately, some of these contain\ncancer-causing cadmium, lead, chromium, and mercury. Other harmful compounds and chemicals\ncan cause widespread contamination when released as toxic waste water\nin rivers and oceans. Technologies are now so advanced\nin some countries that the entire process of growing\nand producing fabric barely touches a human hand. But only up until this point. After the finished cloth \ntravels to factories, often in Bangladesh, China, India,\nor Turkey, human labor is still required \nto stitch them up into t-shirts, intricate work that \nmachines just can't do. This process has its own problems. Bangladesh, for example, which has surpassed China as the world's\nbiggest exporter of cotton t-shirts, employs 4.5 million people\nin the t-shirt industry, but they typically face poor conditions\nand low wages. After manufacture, all those t-shirts\ntravel by ship, train, and truck to be sold in high-income countries, a process that gives cotton \nan enormous carbon footprint. Some countries produce \ntheir own clothing domestically, which cuts out this polluting stage, but generally, apparel production accounts\nfor 10% of global carbon emissions. And it's escalating. Cheaper garments and the public's\nwillingness to buy boosted global production \nfrom 1994 to 2014 by 400% to around 80 billion garments each year. Finally, in a consumer's home, the t-shirt goes through one of the most\nresource-intensive phases of its lifetime. In America, for instance, the average household does nearly\n400 loads of laundry per year each using about 40 gallons of water. Washing machines and dryers \nboth use energy, with dryers requiring five to six times\nmore than washers. This dramatic shift in clothing \nconsumption over the last 20 years, driven by large corporations\nand the trend of fast fashion has cost the environment, the health of farmers, and driven questionable \nhuman labor practices. It's also turned fashion into the second\nlargest polluter in the world after oil. But there are things we can do. Consider shopping secondhand. Try to look for textiles made from\nrecycled or organic fabrics. Wash clothes less and line dry\nto save resources. Instead of throwing them away\nat the end of their life, donate, recycle, or reuse them\nas cleaning rags. And, finally, you might ask yourself, how many t-shirts and articles of clothing\nwill you consume over your lifetime, and what will be their combined \nimpact on the world?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where in the world is cotton commonly grown?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "India"}, {"label": "B", "text": "China"}, {"label": "C", "text": "America"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A and b only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "To produce the average t-shirt takes:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "225 kg of cotton"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Large amounts of pesticides"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2700 liters of water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "C only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both B and C"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Of the 22.7 million metric tons of cotton produced, ____ is grown organically.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less than 1%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Approximately 10%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "None"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of it"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The snowy ropes of cotton produced to create fabric are called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yarns"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Slivers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bales"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Knits"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "After t-shirts are made and shipped to high income countries, often the ____ footprint of the item increases drastically.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cadmium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cotton"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Carbon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lead"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If you decreased the amount of laundry loads in your household to 100 less than the average, how much water would you save per year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "200 gallons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "400 gallons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "600 gallons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "800 gallons"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

She'd been born with the physical\nperfection so complete that she was worshipped as a new\nincarnation of Venus, the goddess of love. But real-life human lovers were\ntoo intimidated even to approach her. When her father asked for guidance\nfrom the Oracle of Apollo, the god of light, reason, and prophecy. He was told to abandon his daughter\non a rocky crag where she would marry a cruel\nand savage serpent-like winged evil. Alone on the crag, Psyche felt\nZephyr the West Wind gently lifting her into the air. It set her down before a palace. \"You are home,\" she heard \nan unseen voice say. \"Your husband awaits you\nin the bedroom, if you dare to meet him.\" She was brave enough, Psyche told herself. The bedroom was so dark that she\ncouldn't see her husband. But he didn't feel serpent-like at all. His skin was soft,\nand his voice and manner were gentle. She asked him who he was, but he told her this was the one question\nhe could never answer. If she loved him, \nshe would not need to know. His visits continued night after night. Before long, Psyche was pregnant. She rejoiced, but was also conflicted. How could she raise her baby\nwith a man she'd never seen? That night, Psyche approached\nher sleeping husband holding an oil lamp. What she found was the god Cupid who sent gods and humans \nlusting after each other with the pinpricks of his arrows. Psyche dropped her lamp,\nburning Cupid with hot oil. He said he'd been in love with Psyche\never since his jealous mother, Venus, asked him to embarrass the young woman\nby pricking her with an arrow. But taken with Psyche's beauty, Cupid\nused the arrow on himself. He didn't believe, however, that gods\nand humans could love as equals. Now that she knew his true form,\ntheir hopes for happiness were dashed, so he flew away. Psyche was left in despair until\nthe unseen voice returned and told her that it was indeed possible for her and Cupid \nto love each other as equals. Encouraged, she set out to find him. But Venus intercepted Psyche and said\nshe and Cupid could only wed if she completed a series \nof impossible tasks. First, Psyche was told to sort a huge,\nmessy pile of seeds in a single night. Just as she was abandoning hope, an ant colony took pity on her\nand helped with the work. Successfully passing the first trial, Psyche next had to bring Venus\nthe fleece of the golden sheep, who had a reputation for \ndisemboweling stray adventurers, but a river god showed her how to collect the fleece the sheep \nhad snagged on briars, and she succeeded. Finally, Psyche had to travel\nto the Underworld and convince Proserpina, \nqueen of the dead, to put a drop of her beauty in a box\nfor Venus. Once again, the unseen voice came\nto Psyche's aide. It told her to bring barley cakes for\nCerberus, the guard dog to the Underworld and coins to pay the boatman, Charon\nto ferry her across the river Styx. With her third and final task complete, Psyche returned to the land of the living. Just outside Venus's palace, she opened\nthe box of Proserpina's beauty, hoping to keep some for herself. But the box was filled with sleep,\nnot beauty, and Psyche collapsed in the road. Cupid, now recovered from his wounds,\nflew to his sleeping bride. He told her he'd been wrong and foolish. Her fearlessness in the face\nof the unknown proved that she was more than his equal. Cupid gave Psyche amborsia, the nectar\nof the gods, making her immortal.

{"page": 90, "lesson": 11, "title": "The left brain vs. right brain myth - Elizabeth Waters", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-left-brain-vs-right-brain-myth-elizabeth-waters", "transcript": {"en": "Behold the human brain, it's lumpy landscape visibly split into\na left and right side. This structure has inspired one of \nthe most pervasive ideas about the brain, that the left side controls logic and the right, creativity. And yet, this is a myth unsupported\nby scientific evidence. So how did this misleading idea\ncome about, and what does it get wrong? It's true that the brain has a right\nand a left side. This is most apparent \nwith the outer layer, or the cortex. Internal regions, like the striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brain stem appear to be made from continuous tissue, but in fact, they're also organized\nwith left and right sides. The left and the right sides of the brain\ndo control different body functions, such as movement and sight. The brain's right side controls the motion\nof the left arm and leg and vice versa. The visual system is even more complex. Each eye has a left \nand right visual field. Both left visual fields are sent\nto the right side of the brain, and both right fields \nare sent to the left side. So the brain uses both sides to make\na complete image of the world. Scientists don't know for sure\nwhy we have that crossing over. One theory is it began soon after animals\ndeveloped more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage\nof quicker reflexes. If an animal sees a predator coming\nfrom its left side, it's best off escaping to the right. So we can say that vision \nand movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure, but problems arise when we over-extend\nthat idea to logic and creativity. This misconception began in \nthe mid-1800s when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke, examined patients who had problems\ncommunicating due to injuries. The researchers found damage to\nthe patients' left temporal lobes, so they suggested that language is\ncontrolled by the left side of the brain. That captured the popular imagination. Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea \nof a logical left hemisphere competing with an emotional \nright hemisphere represented by his characters\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But this idea didn't hold up when doctors\nand scientists examined patients who were missing\na hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated. These patients showed a complete\nrange of behaviors, both logical and creative. Later research showed that one side\nof the brain is more active than the other for some functions. Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right. So one side of the brain may do more work, but this varies by system\nrather than by person. There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant \nsides of the brain, or to support the idea \nof a left-right split between logic and creativity. Some people may be particularly logical\nor creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides\nof their brains. And even the idea of logic and creativity\nbeing at odds with each other doesn't hold up well. Solving complex math problems requires\ninspired creativity and many vibrant works of art\nhave intricate logical frameworks. Almost every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain\nfunctioning as one."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which statement below is a myth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The human brain is clearly divided into two parts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The left side of the brain controls logic, and the right controls creativity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The outer layer of the brain is called the cortex"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both a and b are myths"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The right side of the brain controls the movement of the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Right side arm and leg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Left side arm and leg"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both arms and legs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The eyes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When patients who had both hemispheres of their brains separated were tested, what was the result?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "they had no creativity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They had no logic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The patients showed both logical and creative behaviors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Patients lost their eyesight"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Attention is more localized to the ________ side of the brain, while language is more localized to the ________ side of the brain.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Left; right"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Right, left"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

That's equivalent to the weight\nof 14 Eiffel Towers. Most of this caffeine is consumed\nin coffee and tea, but it's also ingested in some sodas, chocolate, caffeine pills, and even beverages labeled decaf. Caffeine helps us feel alert,\nfocused, happy, and energetic, even if we haven't had enough sleep. But it can also raise our blood pressure,\nand make us feel anxious. It's the world most widely used drug. So how does it keep us awake? Caffeine evolved in plants where\nit serves a few purposes. In high doses, as it's found in the leaves\nand seeds of certain species, it's toxic to insects. But when they consume it in lower doses,\nas it's found in nectar, it can actually help them remember\nand revisit flowers. In the human body, caffeine acts as a\nstimulant for the central nervous system. It keeps us awake by blocking one of\nthe body's key sleep-inducing molecules, a substance called adenosine. Your body needs a constant supply\nof energy, which it gets by breaking down\na high-energy molecule called ATP. In the process, it liberates adenosine,\nATP's chemical backbone. Neurons in your brain have receptors\nperfectly tailored to this molecule. When adenosine docks to these receptors, it activates a cascade \nof biochemical reactions that cause neurons to fire more sluggishly and slow the release of important\nbrain-signaling molecules. In other words, you get sleepy. Caffeine is what's called an adenosine\nreceptor antagonist. That means it derails this process\nof slowing your neurons down by blocking adenosine receptors. Caffeine and adenosine have a similar\nmolecular structure, close enough that caffeine can wedge into\nthe adenosine receptors, but not close enough to activate them. To summarize, \nadenosine inhibits your neurons. Caffeine inhibits the inhibitor,\nso it stimulates you. Caffeine can also boost positive feelings. In some neurons, the adenosine receptors are linked to receptors \nfor another molecule called dopamine. One of dopamine's roles in the brain\nis to promote feelings of pleasure. When adenosine docks in one of these\npaired receptors, that can make it harder for dopamine\nto fit in its own spot, interrupting its mood-lifting work. But when caffeine takes adenosine's place,\nit doesn't have the same effect, and dopamine can slide in. There's evidence that caffeine's effects\non adenosine and dopamine receptors can have long-term benefits, too,\nreducing the risk of diseases like Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,\nand some types of cancer. Caffeine can also ramp up the body's\nability to burn fat. In fact, some sports organizations think that caffeine gives athletes \nan unfair advantage and have placed limits on its consumption. From 1972 until 2004, Olympic athletes had to stay below\na certain blood-caffeine concentration to compete. Of course, not all of caffeine's effects\nare so helpful. It might make you feel better\nand more alert, but it can also raise your heart rate\nand blood pressure, cause increased urination or diarrhea, and contribute to insomnia and anxiety. Plus, the foods and beverages\ncaffeine is found in have their own impacts on your body\nthat have to be taken into account. Your brain can adapt to regular\nconsumption of caffeine. If your adenosine receptors \nare perpetually clogged, your body will manufacture extra ones. That way, even with caffeine around, adenosine can still do its job\nof signaling the brain to power down. That's why you may find you need\nto consume more and more caffeine to feel as alert. There are more and more adenosine\nreceptors to block. It's also why if you suddenly \nquit caffeine, you may experience \nan unpleasant withdrawal. With plenty of receptors \nand no competition, adenosine can work overtime, causing symptoms like headaches, tiredness, and depressed moods. But in a few days, the extra adenosine\nreceptors will disappear, your body will readjust, and you'll feel just as alert as ever, even without an infusion of the world's\nmost popular stimulant."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following isn’t a caffeine source?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Some sodas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chocolate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Energy drinks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Decaf coffee"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Adenosine's relationship with caffeine is best described as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Competition on the same receptor binding site"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cooperation on the same receptor binding site"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There is no direct relationship between them"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The relationship isn’t fully understood"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following isn’t manifested after caffeine consumption:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Probable weight reduction by helping body burning fat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reduced risk of Parkinson’s disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Raised heart rate and blood pressure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hydration of human body"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When the brain adapts to regular consumption of caffeine, more caffeine must be consumed to get the same alertness.

A politician tells you their plan\nwill create the most jobs. We're so used to hearing these\nkinds of exaggerations in advertising and politics that we might not even bat an eye. But what about when the claim\nis accompanied by a graph? Afterall, a graph isn't an opinion. It represents cold, hard numbers,\nand who can argue with those? Yet, as it turns out, there are plenty\nof ways graphs can mislead and outright manipulate. Here are some things to look out for. In this 1992 ad, Chevy claimed to make\nthe most reliable trucks in America using this graph. Not only does it show that 98% of all\nChevy trucks sold in the last ten years are still on the road, but it looks like they're twice\nas dependable as Toyota trucks. That is, until you take a closer look\nat the numbers on the left and see that the figure for Toyota\nis about 96.5%. The scale only goes between 95 and 100%. If it went from 0 to 100,\nit would look like this. This is one of the most common\nways graphs misrepresent data, by distorting the scale. Zooming in on a small portion\nof the y-axis exaggerates a barely detectable difference\nbetween the things being compared. And it's especially misleading \nwith bar graphs since we assume the difference\nin the size of the bars is proportional to the values. But the scale can also be distorted\nalong the x-axis, usually in line graphs\nshowing something changing over time. This chart showing the rise\nin American unemployment from 2008 to 2010 manipulates the x-axis in two ways. First of all, the scale is inconsistent, compressing the 15-month span\nafter March 2009 to look shorter than \nthe preceding six months. Using more consistent data points\ngives a different picture with job losses tapering off\nby the end of 2009. And if you wonder why\nthey were increasing in the first place, the timeline starts immediately after\nthe U.S.'s biggest financial collapse since the Great Depression. These techniques are known as\ncherry picking. A time range can be carefully chosen\nto exclude the impact of a major event right outside it. And picking specific data points\ncan hide important changes in between. Even when there's nothing wrong\nwith the graph itself, leaving out relevant data can give\na misleading impression. This chart of how many people watch\nthe Super Bowl each year makes it look like the event's\npopularity is exploding. But it's not accounting \nfor population growth. The ratings have actually held steady because while the number \nof football fans has increased, their share of overall viewership has not. Finally, a graph can't tell you much if you don't know the full significance \nof what's being presented. Both of the following graphs\nuse the same ocean temperature data from the National Centers \nfor Environmental Information. So why do they seem to give\nopposite impressions? The first graph plots the average\nannual ocean temperature from 1880 to 2016, making the change look insignificant. But in fact, a rise of even\nhalf a degree Celsius can cause massive ecological disruption. This is why the second graph, which show the average temperature\nvariation each year, is far more significant. When they're used well, graphs can\nhelp us intuitively grasp complex data. But as visual software has enabled\nmore usage of graphs throughout all media, it's also made them easier to use\nin a careless or dishonest way.

The patient didn't actually\nswallow a stone the size of a coconut. Kidney stones form inside the body, but unfortunately, they're extremely\npainful to get out. A kidney stone is a hard mass\nof crystals that can form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Urine contains compounds \nthat consist of calcium, sodium, potassium, oxalate, uric acid, and phosphate. If the levels of these particles\nget too high, or if urine becomes too acidic\nor basic, the particles can clump together\nand crystallize. Unless the problem is addressed, the crystals will gradually grow\nover a few weeks, months, or even years, forming a detectable stone. Calcium oxalate is the most common\ntype of crystal to form this way, and accounts for about \n80% of kidney stones. Less common kidney stones are made\nof calcium phosphate, or uric acid. A slightly different type of stone made of the minerals magnesium\nammonium phosphate, or struvite, can be caused by bacterial infection. And even rarer stones can result\nfrom genetic disorders or certain medications. A kidney stone can go undetected\nuntil it starts to move. When a stone travels\nthrough the kidney and into the ureter, its sharp edges scratch\nthe walls of the urinary tract. Nerve endings embedded in this tissue\ntransmit excruciating pain signals through the nervous system. And the scratches can send blood flowing\ninto the urine. This can be accompanied \nby symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation while urinating. If a stone gets big enough\nto actually block the flow of urine, it can create an infection,\nor back flow, and damage the kidneys themselves. But most kidney stones \ndon't become this serious, or even require invasive treatment. Masses less than five millimeters\nin diameter will usually pass out \nof the body on their own. A doctor will often simply recommend\ndrinking large amounts of water to help speed the process along, and maybe taking some pain killers. If the stone is slightly larger,\nmedications like alpha blockers can help by relaxing the muscles\nin the ureter and making it easier \nfor the stone to get through. Another medication called\npotassium citrate can help dissolve the stones by creating\na less acidic urine. For medium-sized stones up to about\nten millimeters, one option is pulverizing them\nwith soundwaves. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy\nuses high-intensity pulses of focused ultrasonic energy\naimed directly at the stone. The pulses create vibrations inside\nthe stone itself and small bubbles jostle it. These combined forces crush the stone\ninto smaller pieces that can pass out of the body more easily. But zapping a stone with sound\ndoesn't work as well if it's simply too big. So sometimes, more invasive\ntreatments are necessary. A rigid tube called a stent\ncan be placed in the ureter to expand it. Optical fibers can deliver laser pulses\nto break up the stone. Stones can also be surgically removed\nthrough an incision in the patient's back or groin. What about just avoiding kidney stones\nin the first place? For people prone to them, their doctor may recommend\ndrinking plenty of water, which dilutes the calcium oxalate\nand other compounds that eventually build up \ninto painful stones. Foods like potato chips, spinach, rhubarb, and beets are high in oxalate, so doctors might advise limiting them. Even though calcium \nis often found in stones, calcium in foods and beverages\ncan actually help by binding to oxalate \nin the digestive tract before it can be absorbed\nand reach the kidneys. If you do end up with a kidney stone,\nyou're not alone.

{"page": 90, "lesson": 15, "title": "How fan films shaped The Lego Movie", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/U1towgtz", "transcript": {"en": "This is a 20-minute VHS tape about a LEGO\ncharacter called Jack Stone. When it came out in 2001, it was the first\nreal computer-animated Lego movie. … but it hasn’t aged that well. \"Incredible!\" \"Fantastic.\" Thirteen years later, The Lego Movie looked\nlike this: Let’s watch that again. This is 2001. \"There you have it.\" And this is 2014. \"Yes, that's me.\" That is a huge difference. Here’s how they made it happen. “My name is Grant Freckelton, I’m a production\ndesigner at Animal Logic.” He’s overseen the animation style of movies\nlike Legend of the Guardians, 300, and more recently, The Lego Movie, with co-directors\nChris Miller and Phil Lord. “Chris and Phil were determined to sort\nof make sure the audience was confused about what they were seeing. You know is it actually stop motion, or is\nit CG film?” And that became a big debate. Before the movie came out, there was a lot\nof conversation about whether the movie was stop motion or computer animation. \"It is, I would say 99% CG animation, but\nit respects the rules of stop motion animation, and is designed to emulate that style.” To understand what made that style so unique,\nyou have to look back at what Lego movies used to look like. Early productions for themes like Bionicle,\nStar Wars, and Batman helped establish the whimsical feel of Lego movies — but the\nanimation didn’t fit the physics of the toy itself. “There was this tendency to sort of treat\nthe plastic like it was flexible rubber, which meant that the characters could flex and move\na lot more than they might be able to in real life.” That style is typical of more traditional\ncomputer animation, like what you’d expect to see in a Pixar movie. Take a shot like this, for example. The background isn’t made of actual blocks,\nplastic limbs are bending in ways they couldn’t, and the faces are a bizarre blend of skin-like\ntexture and Lego geometry. It doesn’t look like a scene you could make\nat home with your own Legos. Compare that to scenes from The Lego Movie,\nwhere everything — gunshots, smoke, water, fire, explosions, clouds, even mud on the camera\nlens — are all made up of Lego pieces as they look in real life. “We respected the hardness of the plastic\nby not necessarily bending on the elbow, which you can’t do on a real Lego minifig.” That means that any movement you see onscreen\nsimulates the adjustment or replacement of an individual Lego piece. A joint or facial expression will never actually\nbend or stretch — it’ll either move slightly or be replaced by another piece. Early Lego movies lacked that level of discipline. They struggled because they fought back against the limitations of the medium instead of embracing them. But the creators of the Lego Movie saw things\ndifferently. “Characters that have limitations force you\nto find solutions and charming ways of doing things in different ways. I mean, look at R2-D2: he’s like, the ultimate\nlimited character, he’s basically a bin with wheels that makes beeping noises, and\nthat’s all he's got to work with. And yet he’s a really charming character and everybody loves him. Same with BB-8. And other characters. Same with the Muppets, they’re essentially sock puppets with googly eyes that you don't really have much control over. But it’s from those limitations that you actually get a lot of charm.” Every now and then, the Lego movie animators\nwould let some joints overextend slightly to make room for a nod or a shrug of the shoulders... But overall, sticking to the plastic rule\nmade for a believable movie. You can freeze frame any part of the Lego\nMovie and look at a scene that you could practically make at home. “We were always trying to echo and hark\nback to how a child might make a film. So we would alternate between thinking like\nresponsible filmmakers working on a large-budget Warner Brothers animated film, and then we\nwould suddenly approach a scene as if we were like a kid animating in their basement.” But the history of Lego movies actually does start\nwith kids animating in their basements. In 1973, two Danish cousins, aged 10 and 12,\nshot a short film called Journey to the Moon on Super 8 film. They made it for their grandparents’ 50th\nwedding anniversary — and it’s widely considered to be the first time anyone made\na motion picture with Lego blocks. Note that the “people” in this film are\njust little cylinder blocks — this was before any version of the minifigure design came\nout. Movies like this came to be known as “Brickfilms.” When fans were making these at home, they\nshot them in traditional stop motion. Footage was usually shot “on twos,” which\nmeant that they would take 12 pictures — adjusting the characters every other frame — to make\none second of film. Shooting “on ones” meant taking 24 pictures\nper second — this was usually reserved for making faster movements like running look\nsmoother. When the Danish cousins sent their movie to\nthe managing director of the Lego Group, they were rewarded with a tour of the Lego factory\nand sent home with large Lego sets. But Lego hasn’t always had the most positive\nreaction to homemade fan films like this one. Between 1985 and 1989, a teenage animator\nnamed Lindsay Fleay worked on a 16-minute short called The Magic Portal. He used borrowed equipment to shoot it in\nhis parents’ basement. Before entering festivals and competitions,\nFleay sent the film to Lego to see if they were interested in doing something with it. At first, Lego responded with a letter of\napproval. But soon, the company started expressing legal\nconcerns and issued a letter demanding Fleay surrender all copies of the film within seven\ndays. Lego ultimately backed down, but Fleay had\nalready missed out on most major film festivals by then. Fleay actually went on to work at Animal Logic. He left before production on Lego projects\nbegan, but his movie had a huge influence on the world of Brickfilms. “If you look at the live action portion\nof The Lego Movie, you'll see Finn, the little kid, holds up a sort of cardboard  tube and across the side is written Magic Portal.\" The Lego Movie, of course, was a huge technical\nfeat. There are 15,080,330 animated Lego pieces and 182 unique minifigures in the movie. Early mockups of buildings and vehicles were drafted on a free software called Lego Digital Designer Later on, in the animation software Maya,\neach brick was given profiles for fingerprints, dents, seam lines, scratches, and dust. It’s hard to imagine what The Lego Movie\nwould be if it weren’t for the legacy of these early home experiments. Where most animated films use soft lighting\nmodeled after paintings, The Lego Movie’s lighting was harsh, replicating the actual\nlamps that animators like Fleay used. Playful non-stop motion interludes — like\nlevitation via fishing line — were part of Journey to the Moon long before they appeared\nin The Lego Movie. Even the final break from the Lego world into\nthe real world to meet a human creator parallels The Magic Portal really closely. Ah, my film! It’s easy to miss on-screen, but The Lego\nMovie pays tribute to fan films in the background of this scene — these four clips are shorts\nsubmitted by fans. “Look at all these things that people built!” The homage was a nod to the fans. By doing that, the movie embraced the idea\nthat amateur creators matter — and sometimes, the way they handle source material is far\nbetter than the way major studios are used to doing it. If you want to try any of this at home, you\ncan actually use the same software that the animators of The Lego Movie used. It’s called Lego Digital Designer, it’s\ntotally free off the internet. When I talked to Grant Freckelton, he challenged\nme to make this sort of pig-drawn carriage. I tried. I got the pigs, I got the wheels, but not\nmuch else. It’s very, very difficult."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What style of animation did most fans use to make their Brickfilms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "CGI"}, {"label": "B", "text": "stop motion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "rotoscoping"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Do you take more pictures when you're 'shooting on twos' or 'shooting on ones'?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "ones"}, {"label": "B", "text": "twos"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

If you press on it, it will actually\ngenerate its own electricity. How can this simple crystal \nact like a tiny power source? Because sugar is piezoelectric. Piezoelectric materials \nturn mechanical stress, like pressure, sound waves, and other vibrations into electricity and vice versa. This odd phenomenon was first\ndiscovered by the physicist Pierre Curie \nand his brother Jacques in 1880. They discovered that if they compressed\nthin slices of certain crystals, positive and negative charges would appear\non opposite faces. This difference in charge, or voltage, meant that the compressed crystal\ncould drive current through a circuit, like a battery. And it worked the other way around, too. Running electricity through these crystals\nmade them change shape. Both of these results, turning mechanical energy into electrical, and electrical energy into mechanical, were remarkable. But the discovery went uncelebrated\nfor several decades. The first practical application\nwas in sonar instruments used to detect German submarines\nduring World War I. Piezoelectric quartz crystals \nin the sonar's transmitter vibrated when they were subjected\nto alternating voltage. That sent ultrasound waves\nthrough the water. Measuring how long it took these waves\nto bounce back from an object revealed how far away it was. For the opposite transformation, converting mechanical energy \nto electrical, consider the lights that turn on\nwhen you clap. Clapping your hands send sound vibrations\nthrough the air and causes the piezo element to bend\nback and forth. This creates a voltage that can drive\nenough current to light up the LEDs, though it's conventional sources \nof electricity that keep them on. So what makes a material piezoelectric? The answer depends on two factors: the materials atomic structure, and how electric charge\nis distributed within it. Many materials are crystalline, meaning they're made of atoms or ions arranged in an orderly \nthree-dimensional pattern. That pattern has a building block\ncalled a unit cell that repeats over and over. In most non-piezoelectric \ncrystalline materials, the atoms in their unit cells\nare distributed symmetrically around a central point. But some crystalline materials\ndon't possess a center of symmetry making them candidates \nfor piezoelectricity. Let's look at quartz, a piezoelectric material \nmade of silicon and oxygen. The oxygens have a slight negative charge\nand silicons have a slight positive, creating a separation of charge, or a dipole along each bond. Normally, these dipoles \ncancel each other out, so there's no net separation of charge\nin the unit cell. But if a quartz crystal is squeezed\nalong a certain direction, the atoms shift. Because of the resulting asymmetry\nin charge distribution, the dipoles no longer cancel\neach other out. The stretched cell ends up\nwith a net negative charge on one side and a net positive on the other. This charge imbalance is repeated\nall the way through the material, and opposite charges collect\non opposite faces of the crystal. This results in a voltage that can\ndrive electricity through a circuit. Piezoelectric materials can \nhave different structures. But what they all have in common is unit\ncells which lack a center of symmetry. And the stronger the compression\non piezoelectric materials, the larger the voltage generated. Stretch the crystal, instead,\nand the voltage will switch, making current flow the other way. More materials are piezoelectric\nthan you might think. DNA, bone, and silk all have this ability to turn\nmechanical energy into electrical. Scientists have created a variety\nof synthetic piezoelectric materials and found applications for them\nin everything from medical imaging to ink jet printers. Piezoelectricity is responsible for \nthe rhythmic oscillations of the quartz crystals\nthat keep watches running on time, the speakers of musical birthday cards, and the spark that ignites the gas \nin some barbecue grill lighters when you flick the switch. And piezoelectric devices may become\neven more common since electricity is in high demand\nand mechanical energy is abundant. There are already train stations\nthat use passengers' footsteps to power the ticket gates and displays and a dance club where piezoelectricity\nhelps power the lights. Could basketball players running back\nand forth power the scoreboard? Or might walking down the street\ncharge your electronic devices?

It could be whatever you want made from anything you choose in any shape or size. That kind of creative freedom\nsounds so liberating, doesn't it? Or does it? If you're like most people,\nyou'd probably be paralyzed by this task. Without more guidance,\nwhere would you even begin? As it turns out, boundless freedom\nisn't always helpful. In reality, any project is restricted\nby many factors, such as the cost, what materials you have at your disposal, and unbreakable laws of physics. These factors are called \ncreative constraints, and they're the requirements \nand limitations we have to address \nin order to accomplish a goal. Creative constraints apply \nacross professions, to architects and artists, writers, engineers, and scientists. In many fields, constraints play\na special role as drivers of discovery and invention. During the scientific process \nin particular, constraints are an essential part\nof experimental design. For instance, a scientist studying\na new virus would consider, \"How can I use the tools \nand techniques at hand to create an experiment that tells me\nhow this virus infects the body's cells? And what are the limits of my knowledge\nthat prevent me from understanding \nthis new viral pathway?\" In engineering, constraints have us\napply our scientific discoveries to invent something new and useful. Take, for example, \nthe landers Viking 1 and 2, which relied on thrusters to arrive\nsafely on the surface of Mars. The problem? Those thrusters left foreign chemicals\non the ground, contaminating soil samples. So a new constraint was introduced. How can we land a probe on Mars without introducing chemicals\nfrom Earth? The next Pathfinder mission used\nan airbag system to allow the rover to bounce\nand roll to a halt without burning contaminating fuel. Years later, we wanted to send\na much larger rover: Curiosity. However, it was too large \nfor the airbag design, so another constraint was defined. How can we land a large rover\nwhile still keeping rocket fuel away from the Martian soil? In response, engineers had a wild idea. They designed a skycrane. Similar to the claw machine at toy stores, it would lower the rover \nfrom high above the surface. With each invention, the engineers\ndemonstrated an essential habit of scientific thinking - that solutions must recognize\nthe limitations of current technology in order to advance it. Sometimes this progress is iterative, as in, \"How can I make a better\nparachute to land my rover?\" And sometimes, it's innovative, like how to reach our goal when the best possible \nparachute isn't going to work. In both cases, the constraints \nguide decision-making to ensure we reach each objective. Here's another Mars \nproblem yet to be solved. Say we want to send astronauts\nwho will need water. They'd rely on a filtration system\nthat keeps the water very clean and enables 100% recovery. Those are some pretty tough constraints, and we may not have \nthe technology for it now. But in the process of trying \nto meet these objectives, we might discover other applications\nof any inventions that result. Building an innovative \nwater filtration system could provide a solution for farmers\nworking in drought-stricken regions, or a way to clean municipal water\nin polluted cities. In fact, many scientific advances have occurred when serendipitous failures\nin one field address the constraints of another. When scientist Alexander Fleming\nmistakenly contaminated a Petri dish in the lab, it led to the discovery \nof the first antibiotic, penicillin. The same is true of synthetic dye, plastic, and gunpowder. All were created mistakenly, but went on to address the constraints\nof other problems. Understanding constraints guides\nscientific progress, and what's true in science\nis also true in many other fields.

Spann", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-money-laundering-work-delena-d-spann", "transcript": {"en": "As one of the most notorious gangsters\nin history, Al Capone presided over a vast\nand profitable empire of organized crime. When he was finally put on trial, the most he could be convicted of\nwas tax evasion. The nearly $100 million a year, that's 1.4 billion in today's currency, that Capone had earned from\nillegal gambling, bootlegging, brothels, and extortion, would have served as evidence\nof his crimes. But the money was nowhere\nto be found. Capone and his associates had hidden it\nthrough investments in various businesses whose ultimate ownership\ncouldn't be proven, like cash-only laundromats. In fact, those laundromats are part of\nthe reason for the name of this activity, money laundering. Money laundering came \nto be the term for any process that cleans illegally obtained funds\nof their dirty criminal origins, allowing them to be used within\nthe legal economy. But Capone wasn't the first\nto launder money. In fact, this practice is about\nas old as money itself. Merchants hid their riches from\ntax collecters, and pirates sought to sell their bounty\nwithout drawing attention to how they got it. With the recent arrival \nof virtual currencies, offshore banking, the darknet, and global markets, schemes have become much more complex. Although modern money laundering\nmethods vary greatly, most share three basic steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement is where illegally obtained\nmoney is converted into assets that seem legitimate. That's often done by depositing funds\ninto a bank account registered to an anonymous corporation\nor a professional middleman. This step is where criminals are often\nmost vulnerable to detection since they introduce massive wealth\ninto the financial system seemingly out of nowhere. The second step, layering, involves\nusing multiple transactions to further distance the funds\nfrom their origin. This can take the form of transfers\nbetween multiple accounts, or the purchase of tradable property, like expensive cars, artwork, and real estate. Casinos, where large sums of money\nchange hands every second, are also popular venues for layering. A money launderer may have their\ngambling balance made available at a casino chain's locations \nin other countries, or work with employees\nto rig games. The last step, integration, allows clean\nmoney to re-enter the mainstream economy and to benefit the original criminal. They might invest it into a legal business claiming payment by producing\nfake invoices, or even start a bogus charity, placing themselves \non the board of directors with an exorbitant salary. Money laundering itself wasn't officially recognized as a federal\ncrime in the United States until 1986. Before that point, the government\nneeded to prosecute a related crime, like tax evasion. From 1986 on, they could confiscate\nwealth simply by demonstrating that concealment had occurred, which had a positive effect on prosecuting\nmajor criminal operations, like drug traffickers. However, a legal shift has raised concerns involving privacy \nand government surveillance. Today, the United Nations, national governments, and various nonprofits fight against money laundering, yet the practice continues to play\na major role in global crime. And the most high-profile instances\nof money laundering have involved \nnot just private individuals, but major financial institutions\nand government officials. No one knows for sure the total\namount of money that's laundered on a yearly basis, but some organizations estimate it to be\nin the hundreds of billions of dollars."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "___________ was convicted of tax evasion in the 1930’s.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Alexander Hamilton"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Albert Einstein"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Al Capone"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What act, pertaining to money laundering, was significant in the year 1986?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Money Laundering Suppression Act"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Bank Secrecy Act"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Money Laundering Control Act"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Money laundering is a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hate crime"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Financial crime"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Identity Theft crime"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "___________ is the third stage of the money laundering process.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Layering"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Integration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Placement"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "With the rise of virtual currency what is another method used to launder money?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Second line"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arts & War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bitcoin"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Maranto", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/history-s-deadliest-colors-j-v-maranto", "transcript": {"en": "In 1898, Marie and Pierre Curie \ndiscovered radium. Claimed to have restorative properties, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, water, and food. A glowing, luminous green, it was also used in beauty products\nand jewelry. It wasn't until the mid-20th century we realized that radium's harmful\neffects as a radioactive element outweighed its visual benefits. Unfortunately, radium isn't the only\npigment that historically seemed harmless or useful but turned out to be deadly. That lamentable distinction includes\na trio of colors and pigments that we've long used to decorate ourselves\nand the things we make: white, green, and orange. Our story begins with white. As far back as the 4th century BCE, the Ancient Greeks treated lead to make\nthe brilliant white pigment we know today. The problem? In humans, lead is directly absorbed\ninto the body and distributed to the blood, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. Once in the nervous system, lead mimics and disrupts the normal\nfunctions of calcium, causing damages ranging \nfrom learning disabilities to high blood pressure. Yet the practice \nof using this toxic pigment continued across time and cultures. Lead white was the only practical choice\nfor white oil or tempera paint until the 19th century. To make their paint, artists would grind\na block of lead into powder, exposing highly toxic dust particles. The pigment's liberal use resulted\nin what was known as painter's colic, or what we'd now call lead poisoning. Artists who worked with lead complained\nof palseys, melancholy, coughing, enlarged retinas, and even blindness. But lead white's density, opacity,\nand warm tone were irresistible to artists like Vermeer,\nand later, the Impressionists. Its glow couldn't be matched, and the pigment continued to be widely\nused until it was banned in the 1970s. As bad as all that sounds, white's dangerous effects \npale in comparison to another, \nmore wide-spread pigment, green. Two synthetic greens called \nScheele's Green and Paris Green were first introduced in the 18th century. They were far more vibrant and flashy than the relatively dull greens\nmade from natural pigments, so they quickly became popular choices\nfor paint as well as dye for textiles, wallpaper, soaps, cake decorations, toys, candy, and clothing. These green pigments were made from\na compound called cupric hydrogen arsenic. In humans, exposure to arsenic can damage the way cells \ncommunicate and function. And high levels of arsenic have been\ndirectly linked to cancer and heart disease. As a result, 18th century fabric\nfactory workers were often poisoned, and women in green dresses \nreportedly collapsed from exposure to arsenic on their skin. Bed bugs were rumored not to live\nin green rooms, and it's even been speculated that\nNapoleon died from slow arsenic poisoning from sleeping in his green \nwallpapered bedroom. The intense toxicity of these green\nstayed under wraps until the arsenic recipe was published\nin 1822. And a century later, it was repurposed\nas an insecticide. Synthetic green was probably the most\ndangerous color in widespread use, but at least it didn't share radium's\nproperty of radioactivity. Another color did, though - orange. Before World War II, it was common\nfor manufacturers of ceramic dinnerware to use uranium oxide in colored glazes. The compound produced brilliant\nreds and oranges, which were appealing attributes,\nif not for the radiation they emitted. Of course, radiation was something\nwe were unaware of until the late 1800s, let alone the associated cancer risks,\nwhich we discovered much later. During World War II, the U.S. government confiscated all uranium\nfor use in bomb development. However, the atomic energy commission\nrelaxed these restrictions in 1959, and depleted uranium returned to ceramics\nand glass factory floors. Orange dishes made during \nthe next decade may still have some hazardous qualities\non their surfaces to this day. Most notably, vintage fiestaware\nreads positive for radioactivity. And while the levels are low enough that\nthey don't officially pose a health risk if they're on a shelf, the U.S. EPA warns against eating food\noff of them. Though we still occasionally run \ninto issues with synthetic food dyes, our scientific understanding has helped us\nprune hazardous colors out of our lives."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When first discovered, radium was added to toothpaste, medicine, beauty products, jewelry, water, and food because of claimed ____________ and its _____________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Restorative properties"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Longevity and persistence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Color"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Taste"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A and C"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Lead, while helping to produce a bright white pigment, can be dangerous to humans.

But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor \nof agriculture, highlights tea's importance \nto ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea\nwas first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built\nthe Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown \naround the world today, yet it was originally consumed\nvery differently. It was eaten as a vegetable\nor cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food\nto drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination\nof heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste\nout of the leafy green. After hundreds of years of variations\nto the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage \ncalled muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct\nChinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures\nin the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art\nyou might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th century \nduring the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first\ntea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed\ntheir own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation \nof the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century \nduring the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor \nshifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes\nto loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a\nvirtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three \nessential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power\nand economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. That spread began in earnest\naround the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe\nin large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza,\na Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with\nthe English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the\nmidst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew,\ninterest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times\nthe price of coffee and the plant was still \nonly grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat, \nthe clipper ship, was born out of intense competition\nbetween Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea\nback to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid\nfor all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea \nfor another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem\nwithin China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official \nordered his men to destroy massive \nBritish shipments of opium as a statement against \nBritain's influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War\nbetween the two nations. Fighting raged up and down \nthe Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded\nthe port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing\nfor over a century. The British East India company also\nwanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned \nbotanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China \nin a covert operation. He disguised himself \nand took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees \nand experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there, \nthe plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth\nas an everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed\nbeverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways\nof preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When was tea first consumed as a beverage?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1500 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1300 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "20000 years ago"}, {"label": "D", "text": "15000 years ago"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Along with tea, what are the other two essential goods China exported?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Opium and silk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Opium and porcelain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Silk and porcelain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Silk and jade"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In what dynasty did the Emperor change tea making from pressed form to the loose leaves we use today?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tang"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Qing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ming"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Yuan"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The British traded what for tea?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gold"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Opium"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wool"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Silver"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Both B and D"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "In what Chinese dynasty was the tea plant first transported to Japan?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tang"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Qing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ming"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Yuan"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Gaw", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-does-asthma-work-christopher-e-gaw", "transcript": {"en": "It starts with a cough, or a wheeze. Soon, your chest feels tight. Your breathing speeds up\nand gets shallower, making you feel short of breath. These are common symptoms\nof an asthma attack. Around the world, more than 300 million\npeople suffer from asthma, and around 250,000 people \ndie from it each year. But why do people get asthma\nand how can this disease be deadly? Asthma affects the respiratory system, particularly the smaller airways, such as the bronchi and bronchioles. These airways have an inner lining\ncalled the mucosa that's surrounded \nby a layer of smooth muscle. In people with asthma, the airways\nare chronically inflamed, which can make them hyper-responsive\nto certain triggers. Some of the many asthma triggers\ninclude tobacco smoke, pollen, dust, fragrances, exercise, cold weather, stress, and even the common cold. When people with asthma are exposed\nto these triggers, an asthma attack, or exacerbation,\ncan occur. But how exactly do such everyday factors\nlead to an asthma attack? If an asthmatic is exposed to a trigger, the smooth rings of muscle that circle\nthe small airways in their lungs contract and become narrow. Simultaneously, the trigger\nworsens inflammation, causing the mucosal lining\nto become more swollen and secrete more mucus. Under normal conditions, the body uses this mucus to trap\nand clear particles, like pollen or dust, but during an asthma attack, it blocks the narrowed airways,\nmaking it even harder to breathe. These effects lead \nto this symptoms of asthma. Smooth muscle constriction results\nin the feeling of chest tightness. Excess mucus and increased inflammation\ncan cause coughing. And the wheezing noise? That happens because \nas the airways constrict, air whistles as it passes through\nthe narrowed space. These symptoms may make a person\nfeel like they're running out of air. Yet counterintuitively, \nduring an asthma attack, the inflammation can make it harder\nto exhale than inhale. Over time, this leads to an excess\nof air in the lungs, a phenomenon known as hyperinflation. The trapping of air inside the lungs\nforces the body to work harder to move air in and out of them. Over time, this can lead to reduced oxygen\ndelivery to the body's organs and tissues. Sometimes, in untreated \nsevere asthma attacks, the body can't keep up, which can lead to death from\nlack of oxygen. So how do we prevent these uncomfortable\nand potentially fatal attacks in people who have asthma? One way is to reduce the presence\nof triggers. Unfortunately, the world \nis an unpredictable place and exposure to triggers can't\nalways be controlled. This is where inhalers, the primary\ntreatment for asthma, come in. These medications help asthmatics both\ncontrol and prevent their asthma symptoms. Inhalers transport medication along\nthe affected airways using a liquid mist or fine powder\nto treat the problem at its source. They come in two forms. There are reliever medications, which treat symptoms immediately\nand contain beta-agonists. Beta-agonists relax constricted muslces, allowing the airways to widen so more air\ncan travel into and out of the lungs. The other form of inhalers serve\nas preventive medications, which treat asthma symptoms\nover the long term, and contain corticosteroids. Corticosteroids reduce airway sensitivity\nand inflammation, so asthma can be kept under control. They're also crucial in preventing\nlong-term damage from chronic inflammation, which can cause scarring of the airways. Inhalers are known to be very effective, and have helped many people\nlive better lives. Although we've come a long way\nin improving how we treat and diagnose asthma, we still don't know its exact causes. We currently believe that a combination\nof genetic and environmental factors play a role, potentially acting during early childhood. Recent research has even linked\npoverty to asthma incidents. This may be due to reasons ranging from exposure to additional pollutants\nand environmental irritants to difficulties in obtaining medical care\nor treatment.

Ramana and Sajan Saini", "category": "Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-are-the-challenges-of-nuclear-power-m-v-ramana-and-sajan-saini", "transcript": {"en": "On a December afternoon in Chicago\nduring the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus\nat the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy\nover and over again. They did this by creating \nfor the first time a chain reaction inside a new\nengineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great\namounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian\nsource of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough\nelectricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household\nfor nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global\nelectricity market, nuclear power has declined from\nan all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further\nin the coming decades. What happened to the great promise\nof this technology? It turns out nuclear power \nfaces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie \na series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission\nof uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting\nin many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed\nwith protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total\nof 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140\nlacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less\ntightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits\nthe U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements\ncalled fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass\ntransforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy\npowers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second \nlarger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons\nstrike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even\nlarger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed\nusing control rods made of elements that capture excess \nneutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily\nand stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction\nis a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands \non the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted\nfrom fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low\nand the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago\nused graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down \nneutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium\nand raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use\npurified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still\na little too fast. To compensate \nand keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times \nits natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by\npassing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235 \nfrom heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued\nto highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction\nin a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing\nmust be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction \nof the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the\nkinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor\nas heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive\nan electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical \nnot only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded\ntype of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe\ncarrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly\nand melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape \ninto the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building\nis the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure\nis too high, containment fails and the gasses\nescape into the air, spreading as far \nand wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products\nin these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds \nof thousands of years. The greatest challenge \nfor a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans\nor the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering\nonce the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater\nstorage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water \nthat cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium\nthat failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material\nnot found in nature. This mix must be isolated from\nthe environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage\nin tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about\ntheir long-term security. How can a nation that has existed\nfor only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium\nthrough its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants\nsit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an\neven greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste\nto make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only\na safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years\nof the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap \nthe tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source\nwith incredible potential. But their successors have learned\nhumbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian\nindustrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for\ncomplex, expensive, and risky engineering."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A sub-atomic event in which a uranium nucleus splits into lighter radioactive materials, neutrons, gamma rays, and neutrinos is called a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fusion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chain reaction"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Enrichment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fission reaction"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The series of events in which neutrons from split uranium nuclei lead to the splitting of more uranium nuclei is called a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fission products"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A chain reaction"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Isotopes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neutrinos"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The concentration of the lighter isotope of uranium, uranium-235, is very low in nature relative to the abundance of the heavier uranium-238.

A long, sharp claw reminded him of a lion, but the arm bones \nsuggested a larger animal, one about three meters long. Thinking it might be huge unknown\nspecies of North American lion, Jefferson warned explorers Lewis and Clark to keep an eye out \nfor this mysterious predator. But Jefferson's box of bones didn't\ncome from a lion. They came from an extinct giant sloth. Prehistoric ground sloths first appeared\naround 35 million years ago. Dozens of species lived across\nNorth, Central and South America, alongside other ancient creatures\nlike mastodons and giant armadillos. Some ground sloths, like the megalonychid,\nwere cat-sized, but many were massive. Jefferson's sloth, Megalonyx,\nweighed about a ton, and that was small \ncompared to megatherium, which could reach six metric tons,\nas much as an elephant. They ambled through the forests\nand savannas using their strong arms and sharp claws to uproot plants and climb trees, grazing on grasses, leaves,\nand prehistoric avocados. In fact, we might not have avocados\ntoday if not for the giant sloths. Smaller animals couldn't swallow\nthe avocado's huge seed, but the sloths could, and they spread avocado trees\nfar and wide. Ground sloths flourished for millions\nof years, but around 10,000 years ago,\nthey started disappearing along with the Western Hemisphere's\nother giant mammals. Researchers think that ground sloths\ncould have been pushed out by an oncoming ice age, or competition with other species,\nmaybe humans, who arrived in the region around the time\nmost of the sloths went extinct. Some of the smaller sloths did survive\nand migrated to the treetops. Today, there are six species left\nliving in the rainforest canopies of Central and South America. Hanging out in the trees is a good way\nto avoid predators, and there are plenty of leaves to eat. But this diet has its drawbacks. Animals extract energy from food\nand use that energy to move around, maintain their body temperature, keep their organs working, and all the other activities necessary\nfor survival. But leaves don't contain much energy, and that which they do have\nis tough to extract. Most herbivores supplement a leafy diet\nwith higher energy foods like fruit and seeds. But sloths, especially three-toed sloths,\nrely on leaves almost exclusively. They've evolved finely tuned strategies\nfor coping with this restricted diet. First, they extract as much energy from\ntheir food as possible. Sloths have a multi-chambered stomach\nthat takes up a third of their body, and depending on the species, they can spend five to seven days,\nor even weeks, processing a meal. The other piece of the puzzle\nis to use as little energy as possible. One way sloths do this is, of course,\nby not moving very much. They spend most of their time eating,\nresting, or sleeping. They descend from the canopy just once\na week for a bathroom break. When sloths do move, it's not very fast. It would take a sloth about five minutes\nto cross an average neighborhood street. This unhurried approach to life means\nthat sloths don't need very much muscle. In fact, they have about 30% less\nmuscle mass than other animals their size. Sloths also use less energy \nto keep themselves warm because their body temperature\ncan fluctuate by about five degrees Celsius, less than a cold-blooded reptile,\nbut more than most mammals. These physical and behavioral adaptations \nminimize the sloth's energy expenditure, or metabolic rate. Three-toed sloths have the slowest \nmetabolism of any mammal. The giant panda is second slowest, and two-toed sloths come in third. Moving slowly has allowed sloths\nto thrive in their treetop habitat. But it's also made the sloths themselves\na great habitat for other organisms, including algae, which provides a little\nextra camouflage, and maybe even a snack. Sloths may not be giant anymore, but that doesn't make \nthem any less remarkable."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Thomas Jefferson received a box of giant ground sloth bones he couldn’t identify.
