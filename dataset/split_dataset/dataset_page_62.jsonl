Today's digital cameras do a lot for us, but there's no replacement for the human eye. It's important to learn how cameras work with light to create an image, that way we'll know what's going on when it's time to capture a moment. There are three variables that determine if you're getting the right amount of light for the correct exposure. With a manual camera, we're able to change any of the variable ourselves. Different settings can result in really different pictures. Let's look at the process together. First, see this here? This is the aperture. It's the hole that light passes through. If we make the aperture big, we'll have more light, true, but the sharpness of your photo will decrease very quickly from your focus point, backward and forward. This is what we call shallow depth of field. If we have a very small aperture, we'll have less light but a deeper depth of field. For portraits, it can be nice to have a sharp figure separate from a somewhat blurry background so I would suggest a large aperture. Aperture is measured in f-stops. This can get a little confusing because lower numbers mean bigger apertures and higher numbers mean smaller apertures. Next, there's shutter speed to think about. The shutter acts like a curtain that covers the sensor, and it only opens when you release the shutter button. If we want less light, we open the shutter for a shorter time. If we want more light, we open it for a longer time, but we run the risk of getting a motion-blurred picture. The speed is measured in seconds and fractions of seconds. For shooting sports or anything with a lot of movement, we'll need faster speeds. For taking awesome night landscapes, longer exposures will be better, but we'll need a tripod to steady the shot and prevent motion blur. Another cool thing we can do with light exposures is light painting, drawing in the dark with a torch or the light of a cell phone. Lastly, ISO sensitivity controls how sensitive the sensor is to light. If we use low sensitivity, we'll need more light to register a photo. With a higher sensitivity, we'll be able to get a picture with less available light. 100 ISO is a low sensitivity, while 6400 ISO is a high one. If we increase sensitivity, we'll be able to use faster speeds and smaller apertures, but we'll get noisier images. Good thing we have something to tell us if we're getting the correct amount of light to get a good exposure, the light meter. Sound good to you? Now it's time to get out there and practice taking pictures under different conditions, so you know what to do any time you want to take the best picture."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many variables are we able to change in a manual camera for getting the right exposure?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "With a very small aperture we will get", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shallow depth of field"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Deep depth of field"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If we want to get a sharp figure separate from a blurry background we should choose", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A small aperture"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A large aperture"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The aperture is measured in", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fractions"}, {"label": "B", "text": "F-stops"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A-stops"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "For shooting sport we should use", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fast speeds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Slow speeds"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "ISO controls", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The aperture"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The speed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The sensitivity"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these ISO options will give us a noisier image?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "ISO 200"}, {"label": "B", "text": "ISO 800"}, {"label": "C", "text": "ISO 3200"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

{"page": 62, "lesson": 4, "title": "The terrors of sleep paralysis - Ami Angelowicz", "category": "Medical Conditions", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-terrors-of-sleep-paralysis-ami-angelowicz", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine this: You're fast asleep when all of a sudden you're awoken! And not by your alarm clock. Your eyes open, and there's a demon sitting on your chest, pinning you down. You try to open your mouth and scream, but no sound comes out. You try to get up and run away, but you realize that you\nare completely immobilized. The demon is trying to suffocate you, but you can't fight back. You've awoken into your dream, and it's a nightmare. It sounds like a Stephen King movie, but it's actually a medical condition called sleep paralysis, and about half of the population has experienced this strange phenomenon at least once in their life. This panic-inducing episode of coming face-to-face with the creatures from your nightmares can last anywhere from seconds to minutes and may involve visual\nor auditory hallucinations of an evil spirit or an out-of-body feeling\nlike you're floating. Some have even mistaken sleep paralysis for an encounter with a ghost or an alien abduction. In 1867, Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell was the first medical professional to study sleep paralysis. \"The subject awakes to consciousness of his environment but is incapable of moving a muscle. Lying to all appearance, still asleep. He's really engaged\nfor a struggle for movement, fraught with acute mental distress. Could he but manage to stir, the spell would vanish instantly.\" Even though Dr. Mitchell was the first to observe patients in a state\nof sleep paralysis, it's so common that nearly every culture throughout time has had some kind of paranormal explanation for it. In medieval Europe, you might\nthink that an incubus, a sex-hungry demon in male form, visited you in the night. In Scandinavia, the mare, a damned woman, is responsible for visiting sleepers and sitting on their rib cages. In Turkey, a jinn holds you down and tries to strangle you. In Thailand, Phi Am bruises\nyou while you sleep. In the southern United States, the hag comes for you. In Mexico, you could blame subirse el muerto,\nthe dead person, on you. In Greece, Mora sits upon your chest and tries to asphyxiate you. In Nepal, Khyaak the ghost resides under the staircase. It may be easier to blame sleep paralysis on evil spirits because what's actually\nhappening in your brain is much harder to explain. Modern scientists believe\nthat sleep paralysis is caused by an abnormal overlap of the REM, rapid eye movement, and waking stages of sleep. During a normal REM cycle, you're experiencing\na number of sensory stimuli in the form of a dream, and your brain is unconscious\nand fully asleep. During your dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles. That's called REM atonia. It's what keeps you\nfrom running in your bed when you're being chased in your dreams. During an episode of sleep paralysis, you're experiencing\nnormal components of REM. You're dreaming and your muscles\nare paralyzed, only your brain is conscious\nand wide awake. This is what causes you to imagine that you're having an encounter with a menacing presence. So this explains the hallucinations, but what about the feelings of panic, strangling, choking, chest pressure that so many people describe? Well during REM, the function that keeps you from acting out your dreams, REM atonia, also removes voluntary control of your breathing. Your breath becomes more shallow and rapid. You take in more carbon dioxide and experience a small\nblockage of your airway. During a sleep paralysis episode, a combination of your body's fear response to a perceived attack by an evil creature and your brain being wide awake while your body is in an REM sleep state triggers a response for you\nto take in more oxygen. That makes you gasp for air, but you can't because REM atonia has removed control of your breath. This struggle for air\nwhile your body sleeps creates a perceived sensation of pressure on the chest or suffocation. While a few people experience sleep paralysis regularly and it may be linked to sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, many who experience\nan episode of sleep paralysis do so infrequently, perhaps only once in a lifetime. So you can rest easy, knowing that an evil entity is not trying to haunt, possess, strangle, or suffocate you. Save that for the horror films!"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Scientists think sleep paralysis is caused by an overlap of what two stages of sleep?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Slow-wave sleep and REM"}, {"label": "B", "text": "REM and waking"}, {"label": "C", "text": "REM and slow-wave sleep"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Theta sleep and waking"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "During a normal dream, special neurotransmitters are released, which paralyze almost all of your muscles and keep you from acting out the movements in your dreams.

You know that icebergs\nare mostly underwater, their immense bulk hidden\nbeneath the water. But why is that so? Well, the density of pure ice is less than that of sea water. Usually only 1/9\nof the volume of an iceberg is above the water. The shape of the underwater portion is difficult to discern by looking at the above-surface portion. This has led to the expression, \"tip of the iceberg.\" Here are some thing you might not know about the icy islands. The life of an iceberg begins many thousands of years before it reaches the ocean. Unlike sea ice or pack ice, which form when the ocean freezes, glaciers are made of fresh water. For thousands of years, these glaciers build\nlayer upon layer of ice, constantly compressing, moving, adding snow, compressing, and moving again as they inch along like a frozen river. It is the force of gravity that pulls them towards the sea, where a glacier may calve\noff to become an iceberg or continue to spread up as an ice shelf or an ice tongue. Once an iceberg breaks away from the glacier or ice shelf, it will usually live\nfor three to six years, floating around, carried by the currents and tidal movements of the ocean. As it floats along, it is battered by waves, melts, and smashes into land and sometimes other icebergs. Some icebergs are so unstable that they have more dramatic ends, heaving up, collapsing, and sometimes even exploding. And as they fall apart, many icebergs make all sorts\nof strange sounds. When a piece of iceberg melts, it makes a fizzing sound, called Bergie Seltzer. This sound is made when\nthe water-ice interface reaches compressed air\nbubbles trapped in the ice. As this happens, each bubble bursts, making a popping sound. There are six official size\nclassifications for icebergs. The smallest icebergs are called growlers. They can be up the size of your car and are very dangerous for ships and boats because usually they sit\njust at the waterline where they are not easy to spot. Next are the bergy bits - yes, that is their scientific name - which can be up to the size of your home. The other four sizes are small, medium, large, and very large. So just how big is a very large iceberg? Officially, any iceberg looming larger than 270 feet high above sea level and 670 feet long is considered very large. That's 27 stories of looming, blue ice. And how do icebergs get\nthat blue color anyways? When snow on the glacier is compressed over many hundreds of years, the weight of the snow forces the air bubbles out of the ice, creating pure ice with very\nlittle air trapped inside. This compression is seen when the glacier calves, creating a blue iceberg. An iceberg that has not experienced as much compression and has a large amount\nof air and surface edges reflects light as white. Although they form in far\nnorthern or southern areas, icebergs can float thousands of miles. An iceberg from the Arctic floated as far south as Bermuda. Antarctic icebergs are mostly trapped in the Circumpolar Current, never giving them a chance to float north. However, they have been known to interrupt shipping lanes between Australia, South America, and South Africa. For all their travelling, many people think that these slabs of ice\nare barren of life, but these seemingly sterile ice slabs also harbor their own complex ecosystems and they shape the ecosystems that they pass through. They become mobile, floating ecosystems. Even in the coldest seas, icebergs are always melting, at least a little bit. This melting has a major impact on the ocean around an iceberg. The fresh water from the berg creates a pool of fresh water that can extend a nautical\nmile away from the iceberg. This water is colder\nthan the surrounding sea water, and the temperature variation\ncreates thermal currents in the vicinity of the iceberg. Life thrives on and around an iceberg. Young icefish hide in small\nice holes to avoid predators, while a variety of invertebrates, like jellyfish and siphonophores, congregate in the area. Many of them come to feed on krill, tiny shrimp-like creatures. Snow petrels nest on the icebergs and feed on the sea life nearby. Whales and seals and penguins\nseem to like them too. And even now that you know all this, we're still at the tip of the iceberg. There are all sorts of things we don't know about icebergs. Perhaps you'll be\nthe one to see a little deeper."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does the term “tip of the Iceberg” refer to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "I way to say hello in the old days"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The fact the the majority an icebergs mass is hidden under the surface of the water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A way of saying there is more to something than you can see"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A game Arctic people play in winter"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is a glacier?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A frozen river of ice that carves valleys over many thousands of years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A place in Switzerland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A piece of ice that floats around for a long time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A really blue iceberg"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What force pulls a glacier toward the sea?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gravity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Solar power"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The moon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Little fish under the ice"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How long will an average iceberg last floating around before it melts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1-2 days"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A thousand years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3-6 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "36 years"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 62, "lesson": 6, "title": "A rare, spectacular total eclipse of the sun - Andy Cohen", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-creates-a-total-solar-eclipse-andy-cohen", "transcript": {"en": "On August 21, 2017 the shadow of the Moon will pass from the west coast\nto the east coast of the U.S. Our blue sky will turn black as night and fill with stars, and there will be a hole in the sky where the Sun used to be, surrounded by the fiery\nring of the Sun's corona, a total eclipse of the Sun. This will truly be a historic event. Accounts of solar eclipses date way back on the written record. The early Mesopotamians wrote that the Sun was put to shame during the solar eclipse\nof the 14th century B.C.E. and it may have started the Sun worship of the Egyptian\npharaoh Akhenaten. Ancient Chinese astrologers\npaid with their lives if they failed to predict\nthe solar eclipse and portend the fate of their emperors whose symbol was the Sun. The earliest date of a specific\nevent in human history, a battle between the armies\nof Lydia and Media, occurred on May 28, 535 B.C.E. when a solar eclipse caused the soldiers to lay down their arms\nand declare a truce. So how does it happen? During a total solar eclipse, the Moon moves\nbetween the Earth and the Sun. When this happens, the disc of the Moon appears to perfectly cover\nthe disc of the Sun even though the Sun is much\nlarger than the Moon. But how is this possible? The Sun is 400 times bigger than the Moon, but by sheer coincidence, the Moon is 390 times closer to Earth. Size and distance cancel each other out so that the Moon and Sun appear to be almost the exactly same size. Every time the Moon orbits the Earth, once every 27.3 days, it has to pass\nbetween the Earth and the Sun, a stage called the new moon phase. And every time it passes, the New Moon has a chance\nto block out the Sun. Most of the time, the Moon passes a little above or a little below the Sun, but if they align perfectly, the shadow of the Moon will make a narrow path across Earth and those in the shadows\nwill see a total solar eclipse. Just like on night side of the Earth, the sky during a total eclipse is black and filled with stars. But while the moon perfectly covers the surface of the Sun, it doesn't block\nout the Sun's outer atmosphere, its corona, which appears as a fiery ring around the dark disc of the moon. Solar eclipses occur several times a year, but most often they are partial eclipses where the Moon doesn't quite\nline up with the Sun. And, when the Moon and Sun\nare perfectly aligned, the Moon is usually too far\nfrom Earth in its orbit to completely cover the Sun, creating an annular eclipse. During an annular or partial eclipse, the sky remains bright. Even on those rare occasions\nof a total eclipse, the Moon's shadow is most likely to fall on the 70% of Earth\nthat is covered by water, and few people, if any, will see it. The eclipse of 2017 will be\nremarkable on a larger scale because the Moon is slowly\nmoving away from Earth. If a furry ancestor of ours\nhad bothered to look up during a solar eclipse\na hundred million years ago, it wouldn't have seen\nthe fiery corona of the Sun. It would have just been dark. Eventually, the Moon will have\nmoved too far from Earth to completely cover the disc of the Sun. It is only during our little wink\nof Earth's history that the Moon is at just\nthe right distance to cause a total solar eclipse yet not block the Sun's corona. So on August 21, 2017, when the Moon exactly\nlines up with the Sun and the Moon is close enough to the Earth, its shadow will cross the U.S. and, if you happen to be\nin its narrow path, you will witness one of the most awe-inspiring sights in the universe. But, as incredible as this event will be, total eclipses\nare one of the most dangerous as well. Only specially tinted filters, specifically designed to observe the Sun, should be used.

Our Lesson was created by Gayle Danley, a veteran slam poet who spent decades teaching children to express themselves\nthrough spoken words, a Lesson, which offers\na guide to creating poetry with immediacy and power, also serves as a great\nexample of exactly that. It's a story told in the form of a poem that packs a real emotional punch. She introduces Tyler, who's sitting in an 11th\ngrade writing class, struggling with the assignment\nof having to write a poem based on a personal experience. The story is told from two perspectives, one external and one internal. Miss Gayle's narration sets the stage of the outside world, and spoken word artist Pages D. Matan performs Tyler's inner voice. To set these two realms of inner- and outer-experience apart, a different animation technique was used to illustrate each. The real world was animated\nby rotoscoping, with a frame-by-frame tracing\nof live-action footage in black and white line art. The animation depicting the inner-stream of consciousness world of Tyler's memories was traditionally drawn on paper, featured watercolored backgrounds and a more expressionistic design. Once deciding on this general approach, the project went right\ninto pre-production. In animation, pre-production\nis the planning stage. It's all the decisions\nthat need to be made before going and actually making the thing in its final form. This can include developing the look or design of the piece, experimenting with colors\nand camera angles, revising the script, and so on. All these decisions are important because they determine\nhow much work and time the production will take. Extra time spent here figuring things out can often save a lot\nof time down the road. For our project, a storyboard\nwas first created, in which the framing,\ncomposition, and imagery for each shot was determined. Then an animatic was made, which is basically a movie\nof the storyboard. This helped us figure\nout the timing of each shot. It also helped us get an idea of how well everything\nwould flow together visually between our rotoscoped and traditionally animated scenes once they were assembled. For the rotoscoped shots,\nwe first had to create the live action footage to be traced. Working with what we had\nin our humble office, we created a classroom of desks using only one small table. We shot this multiple times from each angle the storyboard called for, each time with a different volunteer from among our co-workers. Our source footage elements then needed to be composited, or assembled and arranged together, before we could rotoscope them. A composite is a special effects term for a shot that combines\ntwo or more elements in it that were created separately. To do this, we used After Effects, a digital compositing\nand motion graphics program. The first step was to isolate the part of the frame we needed by masking off the unnecessary\nnegative space, or parts of the frame we didn't need. The individual shots\nwere then each layered into one composite shot, resized and arranged appropriately to create the illusion of them all being there in perspective\nat the same time. Every third frame was then exported as an image sequence, ready to be rotoscoped. The tracing was done digitally, drawn directly on a Cintiq monitor. The rest of the animation was done by hand on paper. Unlike rotoscoping, here the timing and motion\nof the animation was all planned out by the animator\nahead of time. An appropriate number\nof drawings were then done to accomplish the movement. Each animation drawing is then scanned, registered, and sequenced together in the computer. That animation sequence is then composited with the layered background art. Camera moves are then\nplotted out and executed. One way that poetry uses language to communicate emotions and ideas is through the use of metaphor. \"Mama's lies are footsteps\ntoo many to count making excuses on black snow.\" Animation's a medium that's also\nuniquely well-suited to communicating emotions and ideas through visual metaphor. Applying the dual techniques of rotoscoped and traditional animation, each with their own inherent looks, allowed us to visually represent the dual nature of the creative process described in the Lesson. There's the internal aspect\nof experience and memory, which is mined for inspiration, and there's the external aspect of revealing it to the world through a structured presentation. We combined both techniques\nfor the last shots of Tyler delivering his poem to the world, allowing us to convey\nin a direct, visual way the power of that moment of communication when internal becomes external, which, in both poetry and animation, is where the magic happens."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What best describes Gayle Danley?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "veteran slam poet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "medical doctor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "film director"}, {"label": "D", "text": "animation expert"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which animation style was not used in this video?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "traditional animation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rotoscoping"}, {"label": "C", "text": "claymation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is a composite?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a series of related images appear in a thematic sequence"}, {"label": "B", "text": "a stiff material used to create figures in claymation animation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the technical term for splicing together film footage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "separately-created elements are combined in one image"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The definition of fizzle likely links back to the Old English word fist, which meant stink. In the mid-fifteenth century, fist developed into the verb fisten, to break wind, which eventually lead to the modern word feisty, but that's another story. In its earliest form, as a variant of fisten, fizzle had a very specific meaning: to break wind without noise. Surprisingly, considering this initial definition, by the 1800s, the word fizzle referred instead to a specific sound, rather graphically, to the sputtering or hissing of a gas or liquid being forced out of a narrow opening. The figurative sense of the word, a weak ending, is thus understandable within the context of a flame consuming the last drops of oil in a lantern or a valve drawing out the contents of the bottom of a cask. Though perhaps not derived directly from this subsiding verb, our modern meaning of fizzle developed as slang in the 1800s. Originally used on college campuses to describe failure, specifically on an exam, it wasn't long before the word came to mean exactly what it does today and was quickly and widely adopted."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the original meaning of the word fist?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a tiny ball"}, {"label": "B", "text": "a tightly wound coil"}, {"label": "C", "text": "to stink"}, {"label": "D", "text": "a barb or thorn"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

But what if our world\nwere two-dimensional? We would be squashed down to occupy a single plane of existence, geometrically speaking, of course. And what would that world\nlook and feel like? This is the premise of Edwin Abbott's 1884 novella, Flatland. Flatland is a fun, mathematical\nthought experiment that follows the trials\nand tribulations of a square exposed to the third dimension. But what is a dimension, anyway? For our purposes,\na dimension is a direction, which we can picture as a line. For our direction to be a dimension, it has to be at right angles\nto all other dimensions. So, a one-dimensional\nspace is just a line. A two-dimensional space is defined by two perpendicular lines, which describe a flat plane like a piece of paper. And a three-dimensional space adds a third perpendicular line, which gives us height and the world we're familiar with. So, what about four dimensions? And five? And eleven? Where do we put these new\nperpendicular lines? This is where Flatland can help us. Let's look at our square\nprotagonist's world. Flatland is populated by geometric shapes, ranging from isosceles trianges to equilateral triangles to squares, pentagons, hexagons, all the way up to circles. These shapes are all scurrying\naround a flat world, living their flat lives. They have a single eye\non the front of their faces, and let's see what the world looks like from their perspective. What they see is essentially\none dimension, a line. But in Abbott's Flatland, closer objects are brighter, and that's how they see depth. So a triangle looks\ndifferent from a square, looks different a circle, and so on. Their brains cannot comprehend\nthe third dimension. In fact, they vehemently\ndeny its existence because it's simply not\npart of their world or experience. But all they need, as it turns out, is a little boost. One day a sphere shows up in Flatland to visit our square hero. Here's what it looks like when the sphere passes through Flatland from the square's perspective, and this blows his little square mind. Then the sphere lifts the square into the third dimension, the height direction where no\nFlatlander has gone before and shows him his world. From up here, the square\ncan see everything: the shapes of buildings, all the precious gems hidden in the Earth, and even the insides of his friends, which is probably pretty awkward. Once the hapless square comes to terms with the third dimension, he begs his host to help him visit the fourth and higher dimensions, but the sphere bristles\nat the mere suggestion of dimensions higher than three and exiles the square back to Flatland. Now, the sphere's indignation\nis understandable. A fourth dimension is very difficult to reconcile with our experience\nof the world. Short of being lifted\ninto the fourth dimension by visiting hypercube, we can't experience it, but we can get close. You'll recall that when the sphere first visited the second dimension, he looked like a series of circles that started as a point when he touched Flatland, grew bigger until he was halfway through, and then shrank smaller again. We can think of this visit as a series of 2D\ncross-sections of a 3D object. Well, we can do the same thing in the third dimension\nwith a four-dimensional object. Let's say that a hypersphere is the 4D equivalent of a 3D sphere. When the 4D object passes\nthrough the third dimension, it'll look something like this. Let's look at one more way of representing a four-dimensional object. Let's say we have a point, a zero-dimensional shape. Now we extend it out one inch and we have a one-dimensional\nline segment. Extend the whole line segment by an inch, and we get a 2D square. Take the whole square\nand extend it out one inch, and we get a 3D cube. You can see where we're going with this. Take the whole cube and extend it out one inch, this time perpendicular\nto all three existing directions, and we get a 4D hypercube, also called a tesseract. For all we know, there could be four-dimensional lifeforms somewhere out there, occasionally poking their heads into our bustling 3D world and wondering what all the fuss is about. In fact, there could be whole other four-dimensional worlds beyond our detection, hidden from us forever by the nature of our perception.

Now add bleach, acid and sandpaper - Mary Koga", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/got-seeds-just-add-bleach-acid-and-sandpaper-mary-koga", "transcript": {"en": "So, the apocalypse has happened. The zombies have come and gone, and all plant life\non Earth has died somehow. All you have are some basic supplies and some seeds of a few types\nof essential plants. So, what should you do to make absolutely sure they grow, seeing how rebuilding human civilization absolutely depends on it? Well, you'd probably think the last thing you should do with these crucially important seeds is something like poking holes in them, or grinding them with sandpaper, or throwing them in acid or hot water. But, in fact, all of these are methods that are commonly used to help seeds start growing. A typical seed consists of a plant embryo encased in a hard seed coat. To start growing, it needs to emerge or sprout from inside this shell. This process is called germination. But just as it would be hard for you to get out of a jail cell with no windows and no doors, the embryo might need a little help escaping from its seed prison, and any process that makes this easier by wearing down the seed coat is called scarification. This lets moisture and nutrients get through the seed coat, making the embryo start growing until it breaks through. Now, you might be wondering why it is that plants would need humans to do all these weird\nthings to their seeds in order to grow, and, in fact, they don't. In natural environments, seed coats are worn\ndown by cold temperatures, bacteria, or even animal digestion. Our scarification methods just mimick and accelerate these natural processes to increase the chances\nof successful germination. One technique we can\nuse is called nicking. To do this, we make a small cut or scratch into the seed coat. Be careful not to cut too deep! You don't want to damage\nthe plant embryo inside. Another way is to file down the seed coat using sandpaper or a nail file. Once again, you don't\nwant to file too much, just enough to wear\ndown some of the seed coat. After applying either of these methods, you'll want to spray the seeds with bleach to prevent mold. Seeds can also be soaked in water to soften the coat. One way to do this is to place the seeds in a nylon bag, then place the bag into hot water. Turn off the heat immediately and allow the water to cool\nto room temperature before removing the seeds. It's important not to heat\nthe seed for too long as this will kill the embryo. Again, you'll want to spray them with bleach afterwards. Finally, you can try immersing the seeds in a sulfuric acid solution. Make sure you're wearing\nprotective goggles and gloves any time you work with such\na dangerous substance. Place the seeds into a wire mesh pouch and immerse the pouch\nin the solution for ten minutes. Then take out the pouch and rinse it with clean water. Take out the seeds and, as before, spray them with bleach\nso they don't get moldy. If you try all of these methods, you will see that some of them are more effective than others, and some work best\nfor different types of plants that have harder or thicker coats. So, knowing what seed scarification\ntechniques work best will be useful if you ever\nneed to survive a cataclysm, start a farm, or just want to plant in your own garden."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do we call the sprouting of an embryo from a seed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Scarification"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germination"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cotyledon"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Birth"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the choices below are NOT requirements for sprouting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Air"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Light"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Soil"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What do we call any method that breaks down the hard seed coat?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Scarification"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Germination"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sprouting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Boiling"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the purpose of spraying the seeds with bleach?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To keep them moist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To clean them"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To prevent mold"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To decrease the smell"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does the method of placing them in acid simulate in nature?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Acid rain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stomach acid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Animal saliva"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fertilizer"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-moral-dangers-of-non-lethal-weapons-stephen-coleman", "transcript": {"en": "what I want to talk to you about today is some of the problems that the military of the Western world Australia United States UK and so on face in some of the deployments that they're dealing with in the modern world at this time if you think about the sorts of things that we've said Australian military personnel - in recent years we've got obvious things like Iraq and Afghanistan but you've also got things like East Timor and the Solomon Islands and so on and a lot of these deployments that were actually sending military personnel to these days aren't traditional Wars in fact a lot of the jobs that we're asking the military personnel to do in these situations are ones that in their own countries in Australia the knight estates and so on would actually be done by police officers and so there's a bunch of problems that come up for military personnel in these situations because they're doing things that they haven't really been trained for and they're doing things that those who do them in their own countries are trained very differently for and equipped very differently for now there's a bunch of reasons why we actually do send military personnel rather than police to do these jobs if Australia had to send a thousand people tomorrow to West Papua for example we don't have a thousand police officers hanging around that could just go tomorrow and we do have a thousand soldiers that could go so when we have to send someone we send the military because they're there they're available and heck they're used to going off and doing these things and living by themselves and not having all this extra support so they are able to do it in that sense but they aren't trained in the same way that police officers are and they're certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are and so this has raised a bunch of problems for them when dealing with these sorts of issues one particular thing that's come up that I am especially interested in is the question of whether when we're sending military personnel to do these sorts of jobs we ought to be equipping them differently and in particular whether we ought to be giving them access to some of the sorts of non-lethal weapons that police have since they're doing some of these same jobs maybe they should have some of those things and of course there's a range of places where you'd think these things would be really useful so for example when you've got military checkpoints if people are approaching these checkpoints and the military personnel they are unsure whether this person's hostile or not so this person approaching here and they say well is this a suicide bomber or not have they got something hidden under their clothing what's going to happen they don't know whether this person's hostile or not if this person doesn't follow directions then they may end up shooting them and then find out afterwards either guess we shot the right person or no this was just an innocent person who didn't understand what was going on so if they had normally four weapons then they would say well we can use them in that sort of situation if we shoot someone who wasn't hostile at least we haven't killed them another situation this photo is actually from one of the missions in the Balkans in the late 1990s situations a little bit different where perhaps they know someone is hostile where they've got someone shooting at them or doing something else that's clearly hostile throwing rocks whatever but if they respond there's a range of other people around who are innocent people who might also get hurt you know the collateral damage that the military often doesn't want to talk about so again they would say well hey if we have access to non-lethal weapons if we've got someone we know is hostile we can do something to deal with them and know that if we hit anyone else around the place at least again we're not going to kill them another suggestion has been since we're putting so many robots in the field we can see the time coming where they're actually going to be sending robots out in the field that are autonomous they're going to make their own decisions about who to shoot and who not to shoot without human-in-the-loop and so the suggestion is well hey if we're going to send robots out and allow them to do this maybe it would be a good idea again with these things if they were armed with non-lethal weapons so that if the robot makes a bad decision and shoots the wrong person again they haven't actually killed them now there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons some of which are obviously available now some of which they're developing so you've got traditional things like pepper spray OC spray up the top there or tasers over here the one on the top right here is actually a dazzling laser intended to just blind the person momentarily and disorient them you've got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones and this one in the middle here the large truck is actually called the Active Denial system something the US military is working on at the moment it's essentially a big microwave transmitter it's sort of your classic idea of a heat it goes out to a really long distance compared to any of these other sorts of things and anybody who is hit with this feels this sudden burst of heat and just wants to get out of the way it is a lot more sophisticated than a microwave oven but it basically is boiling the water molecules in the very surface level of your skin so you feel this massive heat and you go I want to get out of the way and then they're thinking well this will be really useful in places like where we need to clear a crowd out of a particular area if the crowd is being hostile if we need to keep people away from a particular place where we can do that with these sorts of things so obviously there's a whole range of different sorts of non-lethal weapons we could give military personnel and there's a whole range of situations where they're looking at them and saying hey these things would be really useful but as I said the military and the police are very different yes you don't have to look very hard at this to recognize the fact that they might be very different in particular the attitude to the use of force and the way they're trained to use force is especially different the police and as I knowing because I've actually helped to train police police in particularly in western jurisdictions at least are trained to de-escalate force to try and avoid using force wherever possible and to use lethal force only as an absolute last resort military personnel are being trained for war so they're trained that as soon as things go bad their first response is lethal force the moment the fecal matter hits the rotating turbine you can start shooting at people so their attitudes to the use of lethal force are very different and I think it's fairly obvious that their attitude to the use of non-lethal weapons would also be very different from what it is with the police and since we've already had so many problems with police use of non-lethal weapons in various ways I thought it would be a really good idea to look at some of those things and try and relate it to the military context and I was really surprised when I started to do this to see that in fact even those people who are advocating the use of non-lethal weapons by the military hadn't actually done that they generally seem to think we'll why would we care what's happened with the police you know we're looking at something different and didn't seem to recognize in fact they were looking at pretty much the same stuff so I actually started to investigate some of these issues and have a look at the way that police used non-lethal weapons when they're introduced in some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them and of course being Australian I started looking at stuff in Australia knowing again from my own experience about various times when non-lethal weapons have been introduced in Australia so one of the things I particularly looked at was the use of OC spray or lor is IAM capsicum spray pepper spray by Australian police and seeing when that had been introduced what had happened and those sorts of issues and one study that I found a particularly interesting one was actually in Queensland because they had a trial period for the use of pepper spray before they actually introduced it more broadly and I went and had a look at some of the figures here now when they introduced OC spray in Queensland they're really explicit the police minister and all whole heap of other public statements made about it they was saying this is explicitly intended to give police an option between shouting and shooting yeah this is something they can use instead of a firearm in those situations where they would have previously had to shoot someone so I went and looked at all of these police shooting figures and it's you can actually find them very easily for individual Australian states I could only find these ones this is from a Australian Institute of Criminology report as you can see from the Friant period if you can read it at the top police shooting deaths means not just people who have been shot by police but people who have shot themselves in the presence of police but this is the figures across the entire country and the red arrow represents the point where Queensland actually said yes okay this is where we're going to give all police officers across the entire state access to OC spray so you can see there were six deaths sort of leading up to it every year for a number of years there was a spike of course a few years before but that wasn't actually Queensland anyone know where that was wasn't Port Arthur no Victoria yes correct that spike was all Victoria so it wasn't the Queensland had a particular problem with deaths from police shootings and so on so six shootings across the whole country fairly consistently over the years before so the next two years was the years they study 2001 2002 anyone want to take a stab at the number of times given how they've introduced this the number of times police in Queensland used OC spray in that period hundreds 1 3 thousands getting better explicitly introduced as an alternative to the use of lethal force an alternative between shouting and shooting I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that if Queensland Police didn't have OC spray they wouldn't have shot 2226 people in those two years in fact if you have a look at the studies that they were looking at that the material they were collecting and examining you can see the suspects were only armed in about 15% of cases where OC spray was used right it was routinely being used in this period and of course still is routinely used because there were no complaints about it you cannot within this in the context of this study anyway it was routinely being used to deal with people who were violent who were potentially violent and also quite frequently used to deal with people who were simply passively non-compliant right this person is not doing anything violent but they just won't do what we want them to they're not obeying the directions that we're giving them so we'll give them a shot of the OC spray they don't speed them up everything will work out better that way all right this was something explicitly introduced to be an alternative to firearms but it's being routinely used to deal with a whole range of other sorts of problems now one of the particular issues that comes up with military use of non-lethal weapons and people when they're actually saying well hey there might be some problems there's a couple of particular problems that get focused on one of those problems is that non-lethal weapons may be used indiscriminately one of the fundamental principles of military use of forces that you have to be discriminant you have to be careful about who you're shooting at so one of the problems that's been suggested with non-lethal weapons is that they be used indiscriminately that you use them against a whole range of people because you don't have to worry so much anymore and in fact one particular instance where I think that actually happens where you can look at it was the Braga theater surge in Moscow in 2002 which probably a lot of you unlike most of my students had ad for actually old enough to remember so Chechens had come in and taken control of the theater they had were holding something like 700 people hostage they'd released a bunch of people but they still had about 700 people hostage and the Russian special Military Police Special Forces spec Knapp's came in and actually stormed the theater and the way they did it was to pump the whole thing full of anaesthetic gas and it turned out that lots of these hostages actually died as a result of inhaling the gas right it was used indiscriminately they pumped the whole theater full of the gas and it's no surprise that people died because you don't know how much of this gas each person is going to inhale what position they're going to fall in when they come unconscious and so on they were in fact only a couple of people who got shot in this episode so when they had a look at it afterwards there are only a couple of people who'd apparently been shot by armed by the hostage takers or shot by the police forces coming in and trying to deal with the situation virtually everybody that got killed got killed from you know inhaling the gas the final toll of hostages is a little unclear but it's certainly a few more than that because there are other people that died over the next few days so this was one particular problem they talked about that it might be used indiscriminately second problem that people sometimes talk about with military use of non-lethal weapons and it's actually the reason why in the chemical weapons convention it's very clear that you can't use riot control agents as a weapon of warfare the problem with that is that it seemed that sometimes non-lethal weapons might actually be used not as an alternative to lethal force but as a little lethal force multiplier that you used non-lethal weapons first so that your lethal weapons will actually be more effective the people you're shooting out aren't going to be able to get out of the way they're not going to be aware of what's happening and you can kill them better and in fact that's exactly what happened here the hostage takers who had been rendered unconscious by the gas were not taken into custody they were simply shot in the head so this non-lethal weapon was being used in fact in this case as a non as a lethal force multiplier to make killing more effective in this particular situation now the problem that I just want to quickly mention is that there's a whole heap of problems with the way that people actually get taught to use normal ether weapons and get trained about them and they get tested and so on because they get tested in nice safe environments and people get taught to use them in nice safe environments like this you can see exactly what's going on the person who's spraying the OC spray is wearing a rubber glove to make sure they don't get contaminated and so on but they don't ever get used like that they get used out in the real world like in Texas like this I confess this particular case was actually one that piqued my interest in this it happened while I was working as a research fellow at the u.s. Naval Academy and news reports started coming up about this situation where this woman was arguing with the police officer she wasn't violent in fact he was probably six inches taller than me and she was about this tall and eventually she said to him well you know I'm going to get back in my car and he says if you get back in your car I'm going to tase you and she said huh go ahead tase me he does yeah and it's all captured by the video camera running in the in the front of the police car so you know she's 72 and it seemed that this is the most appropriate way of dealing with that and other examples are the same sorts of things with other people where you think well is this really an appropriate way to use non-lethal weapons yeah police chief fires taser into fourteen-year-old girl's head she was running away what else was I supposed to do or Florida police tase a six-year-old boy at elementary school and they clearly learnt a lot from it because in the same district police reviewed policy after children shocked second child shocked by Taser stun gun within weeks same police district another child within weeks of tasering the six-year-old boy just in case you think it's only going to happen in the United States it happened in Canada as well and a colleague of mine sent me this one from London but my personal favorite of these ones I have to confess does actually come from the United States officers taser 86 year old disabled woman in her bed I checked the reports on this one I looked at it I was really surprised apparently she took up a more threatening position in her bed I kid you not that's exactly what it's it she took up a more threatening position in her bed okay but I'd remind you what I'm talking about I'm talking about military uses of non-lethal weapons so why is this relevant because police are actually more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to be more restrained in the use of force in the military are they're trained to think more to try and deescalate so if you have these problems with police officers with non-lethal weapons what on earth would make you think it's going to be better with military personnel the last thing that I would just like to say when I'm talking to the police about what a perfect non-lethal weapon would look like they almost inevitably to say the same thing they say well it's going to be something that's nasty enough that people don't want to be hit with this weapon so if you threaten to use it people are going to comply with it but it's also going to be something that doesn't leave any lasting effects in other words your perfect non lethal weapon is something that's perfect for abuse what would these guys have done if they'd had access to tasers or to a man-portable version of the Active Denial system a small heat ray that you can use on people and not worry about so I think yes there may be ways that non-lethal weapons are going to be great in those situations but there's also a whole heap of problems that need to be considered as well thanks very much"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Although many of the jobs that military personnel do on deployments are similar to the jobs that police officers do in their own countries, what is a major difference between how they are prepared for these positions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Military personnel have access to many more non-lethal weapons than police officers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Military personnel are not equipped with the same non-lethal weapons as police officers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Military personnel receive less training than police officers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Military personnel are prepared identically to police officers but are willing to be sent on more dangerous missions"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a non-lethal weapon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Active Denial System"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Taser"}, {"label": "C", "text": "O.C.

a thousand words but we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true so we assembled a team of experts spanning Harvard MIT the American Heritage dictionary the encyclopedia britanica and even our proud sponsors the Google and we cogitated about this for about four years and we came to a startling conclusion ladies and gentlemen a picture is not worth a thousand words in fact we found some pictures that are worth 500 billion words so how did we get to this conclusion so Aras and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history change over time so many books actually have been written over the years so we're thinking well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books now of course if there's a scale for how awesome that is that has to rank extremely extremely high now the problem is there's an x-axis for that which is a practical axis this is very very low now now people tend to use an alternative approach which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully this is extremely practical but not so awesome what you really want to do what you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical uh part of this space so it turns out there's a company across the river called Google who has started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach they have digitized millions of books so what that means is one could use computational methods to read all of the books in the click of a button that's very practical and extremely awesome let me tell you a little bit about where books come from since time immemorial there have been authors these authors have been striving to write books and this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago since then the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions publishing books now if those books are not lost the history than they are somewhere in a library and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the library and digitized by Google which has scanned 15 million books to date now when Google digitizes a book they put it into a really nice format now we've got the data plus we have metadata we have information about things like where was it published who's the author when was it published and what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data what we're left with is a collection of 5 million books 500 billion words a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome a text which when written out would stretch from here to the moon and back 10 times over a veritable Shard of our cultural Genome of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole was what any self-respecting researchers would have done we took a page out of XKCD and we said stand back we're going to try science now of course we're thinking well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it now um we're thinking what data can we release well of course you want to take the books and release the full text of these F millions of books now Google and John orand in particular told us little equation that we should learn so we have 5 million books that's 5 million authors that is 5 million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit so although that would be really really awesome again that's extremely extremely impractical it's pretty now uh again we can caved in and we did the very practical approach a bit less awesome we said well instead of releasing the full text we're going to release statistics about the books so we're going to take for instance a glim of Happiness it's four words we call it a forr we're going to tell you how many times a particular forr appeared in books published in 1801 1802 1803 all the way up to 2008 that gives us a Time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time we do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing so those two billion lines we call them two billion engrams what do they tell us well the individual engrams measure cultural Trends let me give you an example let's suppose that I am thriving then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did and so I might say yesterday I throve alternatively I could say yesterday I thrived well which one should I use hm how to know well as of about 6 months ago the State ofthe art in this field is that you would for instance go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair and you'd say Steve you're an expert on the irregular verbs what should I do and he'd tell you well most people say Thrive but some people say throve now you also knew more or less that if you were to go back in time 200 years and ask the following Statesmen with equally fabulous hair Tom what should I say he'd say well in my day most people throve but some thrived so now what I'm just going to show you is raw data two rows from this table of two billion entries what you're seeing is year-by-year frequency of thrived and throve over time now this is just two out of two billion rows so the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide [Applause] now there are many other pictures that are worth 500 billion words for instance this one if you just type in influenza you will see Peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were actually killing millions of people around the globe if you were not yet convinced sea levels are rising so is atmospheric CO2 and Global temperature you might also want to have a look at this particular engram and ask and tell Nichi that God is Not dead although you might agree that he might need a better publicist yes you can get some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing for instance let me tell you the history of the year 1950 pretty much for the vast majority of history no one gave a damn about 1950 in 1700 and 1800 and 1900 no one cared through the 30s and 40s no one cared suddenly in the mid 40s there stting to be a buzz people realized that 1950 was going to happen and it could be big but nothing got people interested in 1950 like the year 1950 people were walking around obsessed they couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in 1950 all the things they were planning to do in 1950 all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in 1950 in fact 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened in 51 52 53 finally in 1954 someone woke up and realized that 1950 had gotten somewhat p a and just like that the bubble burst now the story of 1950 is the story of every year that we have on record with a little twist because now we've got these nice charts and because we have these nice charts we can measure things we can say well how fast does the bubble burst and it turns out that we can measure that very precisely equations were derived graphs were produced and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year we are losing interest in the past more rapidly now a little piece of career advice so for those of you who seek to be famous you can learn from the most famous 25 most famous political figures authors actors and so on so if you want to become famous early on you should be an actor because then Fame starts Rising by the end of your 20s you're still young it's really great now if you can wait a little bit you should be an author because then you rise to very great Heights like Mark Twain for instance is extremely famous but if you want to reach the very top you should delay gratification and of course become a politician right so here you will become famous by the end of your 50s and become very very famous afterwards so scientists also tend to get famous when they're much much more old like for instance biologists and physicists can be almost as famous as actors one mistake you should not do is become a mathematician if you if you do that you might think oh great I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my 20s but guess what nobody will really care there are more sobering notes among the engrams for instance here's the trajectory of Mark shagal an artist born in 1887 and this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person he gets more and more and more and more famous um except if you look in German if you look in German you see something completely bizarre something you pretty much never see uh which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets going through a nater between 1933 and 1945 before rebounding afterwards and of course what we're seeing is the fact that Mark shagal was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany now these signals are actually so strong that that we don't need to know that someone was censored we can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing here's a simple way to do it uh well a reasonable expectation is that somebody's Fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their Fame before and their Fame after so that's sort of what we expect and we compare that to the fame that we observe and we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index if the suppression index is very very very small then you very might be being suppressed if it's very large maybe you're benefiting from propaganda now you can actually look at the distribution of separtion indices over a whole population so for instance here uh distribution indices for 5,000 people picked in the English books where there's no known suppression would be like this basically tightly centered around one what you expect is basically What You observe this is a distribution you see in Nazi Germany it's very different it's shifted to the left people are talked about tce less as it should have been but much more importantly the distribution is much wider there are many people who end up on the far left of this distribution who are talked about 10 times fewer than they should have been and then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit for propaganda this picture here is the Hallmark of censorship in the book record so culturomic is what we call this method it's kind of like genomics except genomics is kind of a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome culturomic is similar it's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture here instead of through the lens of a genome through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record the great thing about cultur roic is that everyone can do it why can everyone do it everyone can do it because uh three guys John orwant Matt Gray and will Brockman over at Google saw the Prototype of the engram viewer and they said this is so fun uh we have to uh make this available for people and so in two weeks flat the two weeks before our paper came out they coded up a version of the engram viewer for the general public and so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its engram immediately and also browse examples of all the various books in which your engram appears now this was used over a million times in the first day and this is really the be of all the queries right so people want to be their best put their best food forward but it turns out in the 18th century people didn't really care about that at all they didn't want to be their best they want to be their be so what happens is of course this is just a mistake right it's not that they stbe for mediocrity is just that the S used to be written differently kind of like a f now of course Google's I didn't pick this up at the time so we know we reported this in the sence article that we wrote uh but it turns out that this should just stand as a reminder that although this is a lot of fun when you interpret these graphs you have to be very careful and you have to adopt the best standards in The Sciences people have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes actually we're not going have to to talk we'll just show you all the slides and remain silent this person was interested in the of frustration uh there's various various types of frustration if you stub your toe that's a 1 a ARG if the planet Earth is annihilated uh by the Vogons to make room for an Interstellar bypass that's an 8A ARG this person studied all the args from 1 through 8 A's and uh it turns out that the less frequent args are of course the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating except oddly in the early 80s uh we think that might have something to do with Reagan all right the bottom line is okay there are many usages of this data but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized Google has started to digitize 15 million books that's 12% of all the books that have ever been published it's pretty big it's a sizable chunk of human culture there's much more to human culture there's manuscripts there's newspapers there's things that are not text like art and paintings this will happen to be on our computers on computers across the world and when that happens that will transform the way we have to understand our past our present and human culture thank you very much [Applause]"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Of the books that had been scanned and digitized

{"page": 62, "lesson": 13, "title": "Making a TED-Ed Lesson: Animating zombies with puppets", "category": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/making-a-ted-ed-lesson-animating-zombies-with-puppets", "transcript": {"en": "You might remember\na pair of TED-Ed Lessons written and performed by two educators, Brad Voytek and Tim Verstynen. These two scientists used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions. For example, they spent time debating whether the zombie's stiff gait was caused by basal ganglia damage, like that in Parkinson's patients, or by severe damage to the cerebellum, which can cause ataxia. In each Lesson, Brad and Tim\ncertainly showed us how the walking dead can help us understand neuroscience, but how can the walking dead help us understand animation? Or, more simply put, how did this one-eyed, decaying, and very much dead pile of pixels walk? Puppet animation\nis a relatively quick solution to creating 2-D animation\nof a hand-drawn character. Since the character does not need to be drawn over and over again, it can be animated by moving\neach element individually. Aside from their portrayal in a few great modern zombie flicks, these concocted carcasses\nare generally known for limited, stiff movements. Their traditional stride is perfect for puppet-style animation. When designing a 2-D zombie puppet, or any other type of puppet, it is important to find a design that is both fun and functional\nin a flat environment. For example, you might not\nwant to puppetize, say, Julie Andrews in the \"Sound of Music\" as she spins in circles. We used rotoscoping for her, but that's another lesson. Always begin by sketching\nand designing your puppet in a neutral pose like this. This will allow it to easily transition into and out of a variety\nof extreme positions. Once a character transitions from concept stetches to final design, the next step is to break up the pieces in order to assemble a puppet, keeping in mind that each element needs to have an appropriate\namount of overlap so that the Zombie can bend at his joints. An understanding of anatomy\nis an integral part of designing any 2-D\nor 3-D animated character that needs to move realistically in the context of its environment. Regardless of the number\nof dimensions your character has, you'll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms\nis known as a rig. Once the rig is finalized and the range of motion is determined, the next step is to choose anchor points. Each piece of artwork has\nits own anchor point, which essentially assigns\nthe limb a hinge, which in this case is a joint. Next, line the artwork up so that the anchor point\nfor the forearm-elbow sits on the upper arm's elbow area. Once all the artwork is in place, you can use an expression script that creates links between the body parts. In this case, we used the expressions provided in After Effects. By parenting one layer to another, you could teach the forearm to follow the upper arm and the hand to follow the forearm. This is what's called forward kinematics. The alternative is inverse kinematics, in which a separate set\nof scripts control the motions. In this case, a controller is attached to the anchor point of the hand. The animator then uses the controller to position the hand. The scripts will then use an algorithm to make sure that the rest of the arm and body follows along. Once the character is rigged, we can start animating. Often times, puppet animation is done as straight-ahead action, which means moving\na character frame-by-frame from beginning to end. Another approach\nis pose-to-pose animation, which involves choosing\nyour key poses first, and then filling in the intervals, or in-betweens, later. Regardless of the method of motion, it's important to think of your 2-D puppet as a piece of paper. It can move across a surface in a variety of poses, but it cannot move in perspective. If your character needs to turn its head, then you will need\nto create additional art. We created three different zombie heads and six different hands to achieve different movements and angles that the neutral pose\ncouldn't accommodate. You can recreate almost everything you've seen in this Lesson with a pen, paper, and a camera. The method is called cut-out animation, and it was around well\nbefore the age of software. To create a stumbling 2-D zombie, or a speeding narwhal, or even an abstract character with some semblance of joints, simply print, cut, and fasten your character's limbs together in a neutral pose. You can use fasteners, string, or even just place\nand move them each time. All the same rules and theories that we use in the computer apply to cut-out animation, except under the camera, the only way to animate is straight ahead."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The two educators used a drooling, hag-faced, animated zombie as a mechanism to model the symptoms and medical diagnosis process for various neurological conditions.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Because zombies are known for their limited, stiff movements, what kind of animation would be best to use for them?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It's impossible to animate zombies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Live action"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Puppet animation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All styles of animation are equally as easy"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Always begin by sketching and designing your puppet in a ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Squatting position"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lying down position"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neutral pose"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Arms raised position"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Regardless of the number of dimensions your character has, you’ll need to create a skeleton, which in animation terms is known as what?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A rig"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An aperature"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A scale-eton"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A mistake"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the process called where you create animation by drawing, cutting out the drawing, and taking pictures of it after you move it?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cuppet animation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pixilation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Claymation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cut-out animation"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 62, "lesson": 14, "title": "Animation basics: The optical illusion of motion - TED-Ed", "category": "Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/animation-basics-the-optical-illusion-of-motion-ted-ed", "transcript": {"en": "Take a series of still, sequential images. Let's look at them one by one. Faster. Now, let's remove the gaps, go faster still. Wait for it ... Bam! Motion! Why is that? Intellectually, we know we're just looking\nat a series of still images, but when we see them change fast enough, they produce the optical illusion\nof appearing as a single, persistent image that's gradually changing\nform and position. This effect is the basis\nfor all motion picture technology, from our LED screens of today to their 20th-century\ncathode ray forebearers, from cinematic film projection\nto the novelty toy, even, it's been suggested,\nall the way back to the Stone Age when humans began painting on cave walls. This phenomenon of perceiving\napparent motion in successive images is due to a characteristic\nof human perception historically referred\nto as \"persistence of vision.\" The term is attributed to the English-Swiss physicist\nPeter Mark Roget, who, in the early 19th century, used it to describe\na particular defect of the eye that resulted in a moving object appearing to be still\nwhen it reached a certain speed. Not long after, the term\nwas applied to describe the opposite, the apparent motion of still images, by Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau,\ninventor of the phenakistoscope. He defined persistence of vision\nas the result of successive afterimages, which were retained\nand then combined in the retina, making us believe that what we were seeing\nis a single object in motion. This explanation was widely accepted\nin the decades to follow and up through the turn\nof the 20th century, when some began to question\nwhat was physiologically going on. In 1912, German psychologist\nMax Wertheimer outlined the basic primary stages\nof apparent motion using simple optical illusions. These experiments led him to conclude the phenomenon was due to processes\nwhich lie behind the retina. In 1915, Hugo Münsterberg, a German-American pioneer\nin applied psychology, also suggested that the apparent motion\nof successive images is not due to their being\nretained in the eye, but is superadded\nby the action of the mind. In the century to follow,\nexperiments by physiologists have pretty much confirmed\ntheir conclusions. As it relates to the illusion\nof motion pictures, persistence of vision\nhas less to do with vision itself than how it's interpreted in the brain. Research has shown that different aspects\nof what the eye sees, like form, color, depth, and motion, are transmitted to different areas\nof the visual cortex via different pathways from the retina. It's the continuous interaction of various computations\nin the visual cortex that stitch those different\naspects together and culminate in the perception. Our brains are constantly working, synchronizing what we see,\nhear, smell, and touch into meaningful experience in the moment-to-moment\nflow of the present. So, in order to create the illusion\nof motion in successive images, we need to get the timing of our intervals close to the speed at which our brains\nprocess the present. So, how fast is the present\nhappening according to our brains? Well, we can get an idea by measuring how fast\nthe images need to be changing for the illusion to work. Let's see if we can figure it out\nby repeating our experiment. Here's the sequence presented\nat a rate of one frame per two seconds with one second of black in between. At this rate of change, with the blank space\nseparating the images, there's no real motion perceptible. As we lessen the duration of blank space, a slight change in position\nbecomes more apparent, and you start to get an inkling\nof a sense of motion between the disparate frames. One frame per second. Two frames per second. Four frames per second. Now we're starting\nto get a feeling of motion, but it's really not very smooth. We're still aware of the fact\nthat we're looking at separate images. Let's speed up. Eight frames per second. 12 frames per second. It looks like we're about there. At 24 frames per second,\nthe motion looks even smoother. This is standard full speed. So, the point at which we lose\nawareness of the intervals and begin to see apparent motion seems to kick in at around\neight to 12 frames per second.

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/4-lessons-from-robots-about-being-human-ken-goldberg", "transcript": {"en": "I know this is gonna sound strange but I think robots can inspire us to be better humans see I grew up in Bethlehem Pennsylvania the home of Bethlehem Steel my father was an engineer and when I was growing up he would teach me how things worked we would build projects together like model rockets and slot cars here's the go-kart that we built together that's me behind the wheel my sister and my best friend at the time and one day he came home when I was about 10 years old and at the dinner table he announced that for our next project we were gonna build a robot a robot now I was thrilled about this because at school there was a bully named Kevin and he was picking on me because I was the only Jewish kid in class so I couldn't wait to get started to work on this so that I could introduce Kevin to my robot but that wasn't the kind of robot my dad had in mind see he owned a chromium plating company and they had to move heavy steel parts between tanks of chemicals and so he needed an industrial robot like this that could basically do the heavy lifting but my dad didn't get the kind of robot he wanted either he and I worked on it for several years but it was the 1970s and the technology that was available to amateurs just wasn't there yet so dad continued to do this kind of work by hand and appears later he was diagnosed with cancer you see the what the robot we were trying to build was telling him was not about doing the heavy lifting it was a warning about his exposure to the toxic chemicals he didn't recognize that at the time and he contracted leukemia and he died at the age of 45 I was devastated by this and I never forgot the robot that he and I tried to build when I was a college I decided to study engineering like him and I went to Carnegie Mellon and I earned my PhD in robotics I've been studying robots ever since so what I'd like to tell you about our four robot projects and what they how they've inspired me to be a better human by 1993 I was a young professor at Kearney at USC and I was just building up my own robotics lab and this was the year that the World Wide Web came out and I remember my students were the ones who told me about it and we would we were just amazed and we started playing with this and that afternoon we realized that we could use this new universal interface to allow anyone in the war to operate the robot in our lab so rather than have it fight or do industrial work we decided to build a planter put the robot into the center of it and we called it the telecard and we put a camera in the gripper of the hand of the of the robot and we wrote some special scripts and software so that anyone in the world could come in and by clicking on the screen they could move the robot around and visit the garden but we also allowed have setup some other software that lets you participate and help us water the garden remotely and if you wanted a few times we'd give you your own seed to plant and this was a project an engineering project and we published some papers on me on the design the system design of it but we also thought of it as an art installation it was invited after the first year by the ARS electronica museum in Austria to have it installed in their Lobby and I'm happy to say it remained online there 24 hours a day for over almost nine years that robot was operated by more people than any other robot in history now one day I got a call out of the blue from a student who asked a very simple but profound question he said is the robot real now everyone else had assumed it was and we knew it was because we were working with it but I knew what he meant because it would be possible to take a bunch of pictures and flowers in a garden and then basically index them in a computer system such that it would appear that there was a real robot when there wasn't and the more I thought about it I couldn't think of a good answer for how could he could tell the difference this was right about this time that I was offered a position here at Berkeley and when I got here I looked up Hubert Dreyfus he was a world-renowned professor of philosophy and I talked with him about this and he said this is one of the oldest and most central problems in philosophy it goes back to the sceptics and up through Descartes it's the issue of of epistemology the study of how do we know that something is true so he and I started working together and we coined a new term tell epistemology the study of knowledge at a distance we invited leading artists engineers and philosophers to write essays about this and the result the results are collected in this book from MIT press so thanks to this student who questions what everyone else had assumed to be true this project taught me an important lesson about life which is to always question assumptions now for the second project I'll tell you about grew out of the teller garden as it was operating my students and I were very interested in how people were interacting with each other and what they were doing with the garden so we started thinking what if the robot could leave the garden and go out into some other interesting environment like for example what if I could go to a dinner party at the white house so because we were interested more in the system design and the user interface than in the hardware we decided that rather than have a robot replaced the human to go to the party we'd have a human replaced the robot we called it the telly actor we got a human someone who's very outgoing and gregarious and she was outfitted with a helmet with various equipment cameras and microphones and then a backpack with wireless internet connection and the idea was that she could go into a remote and interesting environment and then over the Internet people could experience what she was experiencing so they could see what she was seeing but then more importantly they could participate by interacting with each other and coming up with ideas about what she should do next and where she should go and then conveying those to the telly actor so we got a chance to take the telly actor to the Webby Awards in San Francisco and that year Sam Donaldson was the host just before the curtain went up I had about 30 seconds to explain to mr. Donaldson what we were gonna do I said the telly actor is a is going to be joining you on stage and this is a new experimental project and people are watching her on their screens and she's got there's cameras involved and there's a there's microphones and she's got an earbud in her ear and people over the network are giving her advice about what to do next and he said wait a second that's what I do so he loved the concept and when the tele actor walked on stage she walked right up to him and she gave him a big kiss right on the lips we were totally surprised we had no idea that would happen and he was great he just gave her a big hug and returned and it worked out great but that night as we were packing up I asked a Tele actor how did the toilet directors decide that they would give a kiss to Sam Donaldson and she said they hadn't said when she was just about to walk onstage the teller directors still were trying to agree on what to do and so she just walked onstage and did what felt most natural so the success of the telly actor that night was that it was due to the fact that she was a wonderful actor she knew when to trust her instincts and so that project taught me another lesson about life which is that when in doubt improvise now the third project grew out of the my experience when my father was in the hospital he was undergoing a treatment chemotherapy treatments and there's a related treatment called brachytherapy where tiny radioactive seeds are placed into the body to treat cancerous tumors and the way it's done as you can see here is that surgeons insert needles into the body to deliver the seeds and all this all these needles are inserted in parallel so it's very common that some of the needles penetrate sensitive organs and as a result the the needles damaged these organs cause damage which leads to trauma and side effects so my students and I wondered what if we could modify the system so that the needles could come in at different angles so we simulated this and we developed some optimization algorithms and we simulated this and we were able to show that we are able to avoid the delicate organs and yet still achieve the coverage of the of the tumors with the can't with the radiation so now we're working with doctors at UCSF and engineers at Johns Hopkins and we're building a robot that has a number of it's a specialized design with different joints that can allow the needles to come in at an infinite variety of angles and as you can see here they can avoid delicate organs - and still reach the targets they're aiming for so by questioning this assumption that all the needles have to be parallel this project also taught me an important lesson when in doubt when your path is blocked pivot and the last project also has to do with medical robotics and this is something that's grown out of a product out of a system called The Da Vinci Surgical robot and this is a commercially available device that's being used in over 2,000 hospitals around the world and the ideas that allows the surgeon to operate comfortably in its own coordinate frame and it's but many of the subtasks in surgery are very routine and tedious like suturing and currently all these are performed under the specific and immediate control of the surgeon so the surgeon becomes fatigued over time and we've been wondering what if we could program the robot to perform some of these subtasks and thereby free the surgeon to focus on the more complicated parts of the of the surgery and also cut down on the time that the surgery would take if we could get the robot to do them a little bit faster now it's hard to program robot to do delicate things like this but it turns out my colleague Peter ABEO who's here at Berkeley has developed a new set of techniques for teaching robots from example so he's gotten robots to fly helicopters to incredibly interesting beautiful acrobatics by watching human experts fly them so we got one of these robots we started working with Peter and his students and we asked a surgeon to perform a task and what we do is we Swift the robot so what we're doing is asking the robot the surgeon to perform the task and we record the motions of the robot so here's an example I'll use a figure eight tracing out a figure eight as an example so here's what it looks like when the robot this is what the robots path looks like those three examples now those are much better than what a novice like I could do but they're still jerky and imprecise so we record all these examples the data and then we we go through a sequence of steps first we used a technique called dynamic time warping from speech recognition and this allows us to temporally align all the examples and then we apply common filtering a technique from control theory that allows us to statistically analyze all the noise and extract the desired trajectory that underlies them now so what we're doing is we take those human demonstrations are all noisy and perfect and we extract from them an inferred task trajectory and control sequence for the robot we then execute that on the robot we observe what happens then we adjust the controls using a sequence of techniques called iterative learning then we do is we increase the velocity a little bit we observe the results adjust the controls again and observe what happens we go through this several rounds and here's the result that's the inferred trijet task trajectory and here's the robot moving at this compute slew speed of the human here's four times the speed of the human here's seven times and here's the robot operating at ten times the speed of the human so we're able to get a robot to perform a delicate task like I got a surgical sub task at 10 times the speed of a human so this project also because of its involves practicing and learning doing something over and over again this project also has a lesson which is if you wanted to if you want to do something well there's no substitute for practice practice practice so these are for the lessons that I've learned from robots over the years and 10 and robotics the field of robotics has gotten much better over time nowadays high school students can build robots like the industrial robot my dad and I tried to build but it's very it now and now I have a daughter named Odessa she's eight years old and she likes robots too maybe it runs in the family I wish she could meet my dad and I and now I get to teach her how things work we get to build projects together and I wonder what kind of lessons that she'll learn from them robots are the most human of our machines they can't solve all of the world's problems but I think they have something important to teach us I invite all of you to think about the innovations that you're interested in the machines that you wish for and think about what they might be telling you because I have a hunch that many of our technological innovations the devices we dream about can inspire us to be better humans thank you you"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the Telegarden?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Telegarden was an

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/toward-a-new-understanding-of-mental-illness-thomas-insel", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] [Music] so let's start with some good news and the good news has to do with what do we know based on biomedical research that actually has changed the outcomes for many very serious diseases start with leukemia acute lymphoblastic leukemia all most common cancer of children when I was a student the mortality rate was about 95% today some 25 30 years later we're talking about a mortality rate that's reduced by 85% 6,000 children each year who would have previously died of this disease are cured if you want the really big numbers look at these numbers for heart disease heart disease used to be the biggest killer particularly for men in their 40s today we've seen a 63% reduction in mortality from heart disease remarkably 1.1 million deaths averted every year AIDS incredibly has just been named in the past month a chronic disease meaning that a 20-year-old who becomes infected with HIV is expected not to live weeks months or a couple of years as we said only a decade ago but is thought to live decades probably to die in his 60s or 70s from other causes altogether these are just remarkable remarkable changes in the outlook for some of the biggest killers and one in particular that you probably wouldn't know about stroke which has been along with heart disease one of the biggest killers in this country is a disease in which now we know that if you can get people into the emergency room within 3 hours of the onset some 30% of them will be able to leave the hospital without any disability whatsoever remarkable stories good news stories all of which boil down to understanding something about the diseases that has allowed us to detect early and intervene early early detection early intervention that's the story for these successes unfortunately the news is not all good let's talk about one other story which has to do with suicide now this is of course not a disease per say it's a condition or it's a situation that leads to mortality what you may not realize is just how prevalent it is there are 38,000 suicides each year in the United States that means one about every 15 minutes third most common cause of death amongst people between the ages of 15 and and 25 it's kind of an extraordinary story when you realize that this is twice as common as homicide and actually more common as a source of death than traffic fatality ities in this country now when we talk about suicide there is also a medical contribution here because 90% of suicides are related to a mental illness depression bipolar disorder schizophrenia anorexia borderline personality there's a long list of disorders that contribute and as I mentioned before often early in life but it's not just the mortality from these disorders it's also morbidity if you look at DIS dis ability is measured by the World Health Organization with something they call the disability adjusted life years it's kind of a metric that nobody would think of except an economist except it's one way of trying to capture what is lost in terms of disability from medical causes and as you can see virtually 30% of all disability from all medical causes can be attributed to mental disorders neuros psychiatric syndromes you're probably thinking that doesn't make any sense I mean cancer seems far more serious heart disease seems far more serious but you can see actually they're further down this list and that's because we're talking here about disability what drives the disability for these disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar and depression why are they number one here well there are probably three reasons one is that they're highly prevalent about one in five people will suffer from one of these disorders in the course of their lifetime the second of of course is that for some people these become truly disabling and it's about four to 5% perhaps one in 20 but what really drives these numbers this High morbidity and to some extent the high mortality is the fact that these start very early in life 50% will have onset by age 14 75% by age 24 a picture that is very different than what one would see if you're talking about cancer or heart disease diabetes hypertension most of the major illnesses that we think about as being sources of morbidity and mortality these are indeed The Chronic disorders of young people now I started by telling you that there were some good news stories this is obviously not one of them this is the part of it that is perhaps most difficult and in in a sense this is a kind of confession for me my job is to actually make sure that we make progress on all of these disorders I work for the federal government actually I work for you you pay my salary and and maybe at this point when you know what I do or maybe what I fail to do you'll think that I probably ought to be fired and I could certainly understand that but what I want to suggest and the reason I'm here is to tell you that I think we're about to be in a very different world as we think about these these illnesses what I've been talking to you about so far is mental disorders diseases of the mind that's actually becoming a rather unpopular popular term these days and people feel that for whatever reason it's politically better to use the term behavioral disorders and to talk about these as disorders of behavior fair enough they are disorders of behavior and they are disorders of the mind but what I want to suggest to you is that both of those terms which have been in play for a century or more are actually now impediments to progress that what we need conceptually to make progress here is to rethink these disorders as brain disorders now for some of you you're going to say oh my goodness here we go again we're going to hear about a biochemical imbalance or we're going to hear about drugs or we're going to hear about some very simplistic notion that will take our subjective experience and turn it into molecules or maybe into some sort of uh very flat unid dimensional understanding of what it is to have depression or schizophrenia when we talk about the brain it is anything but unidimensional or simplistic or reductionistic it depends of course on what scale or what scope you want to think about but this is an organ of surreal complexity and we are just beginning to understand how to even study it whether you're thinking about the 100 billion neurons that are in the cortex or the 100 trillion synapses that make up all the connections we have just begun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information processing and and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that supports it supports our own minds it's a it's actually a kind of cruel trick of evolution that we simply don't have a brain that seems to be wired well enough enough to understand itself in a sense it actually makes you feel that when you're in the safe zone of studying Behavior or cognition something you can observe that in a way feels more simplistic and reductionistic than trying to engage this very complex mysterious organ that we're beginning to try to understand now already in the case of the brain disorders that I've been talking to you about depression obsessive compulsive disorder post-traumatic stress disorder while we don't have a an indepth understanding of how they are abnormally processed or what the brain is doing in these illnesses we have been able to already Identify some of the connectional differences or some of the ways in which the circuitry is different for people who have these disorders we call this the human connectome and you can think about the connectome sort of as the wiring diagram of the brain you'll hear more about this in a few minutes the important piece here is that as you begin to look at people who have these disorders the one in five of us who struggle in some way you find that there's a lot of variation in the way that the brain is wired but there are some predictable patterns and those patterns are risk factors for developing one of these disorders it's a little different than the way we think about brain disorders like Huntington's or Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease where you have a bombed out part of your cortex here we're talking about traffic jams or sometimes detours or sometimes problems with just the way that things are connected and the way that the brain functions you could if you want compare this to on the one hand a myocardial infarction a heart attack where you have dead tissue in the heart versus an arhythmia where the organ simply isn't functioning because of the communication problems within it either one would kill you then only one of them will you find a major lesion as we think about this probably it's better to actually go a little deeper into one particular disorder and that would be schizophrenia because I think that's a good case for helping to understand why thinking of this as a brain disorder matters these are scans from Judy Rapaport and her colleagues at the National Institute of Mental Health in which they studied children with very early onset schizophrenia and you can see already in the top there areas that are red or orange yellow are places where there's less gray matter and as they follow them over 5 years comparing them to age match controls you can see that particularly in areas like the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex or the superior temporal gyrus there's a profound loss of gray matter and it's important if you try to model this you can think about normal development as a loss of cortical Mass loss of cortical gray matter and what's happening in schizophrenia is that you overshoot that Mark and at some point when you overshoot you cross a threshold and it's that threshold where we talk we say this is a person who has this disease because they have the behavioral symptoms of hallucinations and delusions that's something we can observe but look at this closely and you can see that actually they've crossed a different threshold they' crossed a brain threshold much earlier that perhaps not at age 22 or 20 but even by age 15 or 16 you can begin to see the trajectory for development is quite different at the level of the brain not at the level of behavior why does this matter well first because for brain disorders behavior is the last thing to change we know that for Alzheimer's for Parkinson's for huntingtons there are changes in the brain a decade or more before you see the first signs of a behavioral change the tools that we have now allow us to detect these brain changes much earlier long before the symptoms emerge but most important go back to where we started the good news stories in medicine are early detection early intervention if we waited until the heart attack we would be sacrificing 1.1 million lives every year in this country to heart disease that is precisely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain disorders brain circuit disorders has a behavioral disorder we wait until the behavior becomes manifest that's not early detection that's not early intervention now to be clear we're not quite ready to do this we don't have all the facts we don't actually even know what the tools will be nor what to precisely look for in every case to be able to get there before the behavior emerges as different but this tells us how we need to think about it and where we need to go are we going to be there soon I think that this is something that will happen over the course of the next few years but I'd like to finish with a quote about trying to predict how this will happen by somebody who's thought a lot about changes in Concepts and changes in technology we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next 10 Bill Gates thanks very much"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What link is there between AIDS, ALL (acute

Until relatively recently, gemstones were believed to have magical, medicinal properties, and nothing was more effective at treating a kidney disorder than jade.

It quickly became popular\nthroughout Europe, both as a cure for internal ailments and as a decorative ornament and was renamed jade by the French, a word that was borrowed by the English and remains in use to this day. In the 19th century, French mineralogists discovered that jade was being used to describe two distinct minerals: jadeite, which takes its name from jade, and the more common nephrite, the root of which is the Greek\nword nephros, meaning kidney. In addition to describing\nthese two minerals, jade also has an English homonym. With roots that predate the popularity of the lustral gemstone, jade was used to refer to either a disreputable woman or a broken-down horse.

And like many ideas of the ancient world, it was given new life\nduring the Renaissance. As it turns out, this problem\nis impossible to solve because of the nature of pi, but that's another story. Leonardo's sketch, which is influenced by the writings\nof the Roman architect, Vitruvius, places a man firmly at the center\nof a circle and a square. Vitruvius claimed the navel\nis the center of the human body and that if one takes a compass\nand places the fixed point on the navel, a circle can be drawn\nperfectly around the body. Additionally, Vitruvius recognized\nthat arm span and height have a nearly perfect correspondence\nin the human body, thus placing the body\nperfectly inside a square as well. Leonardo used the ideas of Vitruvius to solve the problem\nof squaring a circle metaphorically using mankind as the area for both shapes. Leonardo wasn't just thinking\nabout Vitruvius, though. There was an intellectual movement\nin Italy at the time called Neoplatonism. This movement took an old concept\nfrom the 4th century developed by Plato and Aristotle, called \"The Great Chain of Being.\" This belief holds that the universe\nhas a hierarchy resembling a chain, and that chain starts at the top with God, then travels down through the angels,\nplanets, stars, and all lifeforms before ending with demons and devils. Early in this philosophic movement, it was thought that mankind's place\nin this chain was exactly in the center. Because humans have a mortal body\naccompanied by an immortal soul, we divide the universe nicely in half. Around the time Leonardo\nsketched the Vitruvian Man, however, a Neoplatonist named Pico Della Mirandola\nhad a different idea. He pried mankind off the chain and claimed that humans\nhave a unique ability to take any position they want. Pico claimed that God desired\na being capable of comprehending the beautiful and complicated\nuniverse he had created. This led to the creation of mankind, which he placed\nat the center of the universe with the ability\nto take whatever form he pleases. Mankind, according to Pico, could crawl down the chain\nand behave like an animal or crawl up the chain\nand behave like a god, it's our choice. Looking back at the sketch, we can see that by changing\nthe position of the man, he can fill the irreconcilable areas\nof a circle and a square. If geometry is the language\nthe universe is written in, then this sketch seems to say\nwe can exist within all its elements. Mankind can fill whatever shape\nhe pleases geometrically and philosophically as well. In this one sketch,\nLeonardo was able to combine the mathematics, religion,\nphilosophy, architecture, and artistic skill of his age. No wonder it has become such an icon\nfor the entire time period."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Vitruvian man is named after", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A Roman General"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A friend of Leonardo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A Roman Architect"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Sketch shows a proportional relationship of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Legs to arms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Height to arm span"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Torso to foot size"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What can be found at the top of the Great Chain of Being?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "God"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Leonardo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Vitruvian Man"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How can a circle be drawn around a man, according to Vitruvius?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By connecting points formed by the head, hands and feet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By placing the fixed end of a compass in the navel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Placing ones pencil on the mans head, and spinning the paper very quickly"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Let's talk about evolution. You've probably heard that some people consider\nit controversial, even though most scientists don't. But even if you aren't one of those people and you think you have a pretty\ngood understanding of evolution, chances are you still believe\nsome things about it that aren't entirely right, things like, \"Evolution is organisms\nadapting to their environment.\" This was an earlier, now discredited, theory of evolution. Almost 60 years before Darwin\npublished his book, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed that creatures evolve by developing certain traits over their lifetimes and then passing those\non to their offspring. For example, he thought that because giraffes spent their lives stretching to reach leaves\non higher branches, their children would be\nborn with longer necks. But we know now that's not\nhow genetic inheritance works. In fact, individual organisms\ndon't evolve at all. Instead, random genetic mutations cause some giraffes to be\nborn with longer necks, and that gives them\na better chance to survive than the ones who weren't so lucky, which brings us to \"survival of the fittest\". This makes it sound\nlike evolution always favors the biggest, strongest, or fastest creatures, which is not really the case. For one thing, evolutionary\nfitness is just a matter of how well-suited\nthey are to their current environment. If all the tall trees suddenly died out and only short grass was left, all those long-necked giraffes would be at a disadvantage. Secondly, survival is not\nhow evolution occurs, reproduction is. And the world if full of creatures like the male anglerfish, which is so small and ill-suited\nfor survival at birth that it has to quickly find\na mate before it dies. But at least we can say that if an organism dies\nwithout reproducing, it's evolutionarily useless, right? Wrong! Remember, natural selection happens not at the organism level, but at the genetic level, and the same gene\nthat exists in one organism will also exist in its relatives. So, a gene that makes an animal\naltruistically sacrifice itself to help the survival\nand future reproduction of its siblings or cousins, can become more widespread than one that is solely concerned\nwith self-preservation. Anything that lets more copies of the gene pass on to the next generation will serve its purpose, except evolutionary purpose. One of the most difficult things\nto keep in mind about evolution is that when we say things like, \"Genes want to make more\ncopies of themselves,\" or even, \"natural selection,\" we're actually using metaphors. A gene doesn't want anything, and there's no outside mechanism that selects which genes\nare best to preserve. All that happens is that random\ngenetic mutations cause the organisms carrying them to behave or develop in different ways. Some of those ways result in more copies of the mutated gene being passed on, and so forth. Nor is there any predetermined plan progressing towards an ideal form. It's not ideal for the human\neye to have a blind spot where the optic nerve exits the retina, but that's how it developed, starting from a simple photoreceptor cell. In retrospect, it would have been much more advantageous for humans to crave nutrients and vitamins rather than just calories. But over the millenia, during which our ancestors evolved, calories were scarce, and there was nothing to anticipate that this would later change so quickly. So, evolution proceeds blindly, step by step by step, creating all of the diversity\nwe see in the natural world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which metaphor best describes evolution?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An architect building from blueprints"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Random chaos and explosions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An improv comedy routine"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How can organisms that die without reproducing still propagate their genes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Their genes are absorbed into the soil when they die"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They can help the survival or reproduction of relatives who carry copies of the same genes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They can’t"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why do some non-‘ideal’ traits exist in organisms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are helpful in mate selection rather than directly beneficial to survival"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are secondary ‘baggage’ that has accompanied more beneficial traits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why do some genes get passed on but not others?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A guiding force selects the best genes in each generation to pass on"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mutations in some genes affect organism traits and behaviors in ways that affect their reproductive success"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It’s completely random"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why are humans not ideally adapted to their current environment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because our environment has been changing more quickly than it takes for evolution to occur"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because the rules of evolution don’t apply to intelligent beings"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because there are too many of them"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Synesthesia is a neurological condition in which two or more\nsenses are paired together to create a completely new experience. For example, many synesthetes see letters and numbers in colors, even when they are printed in black. Or they can taste certain words. For instance, jail tastes like bacon. Because synesthesia generally involves the brain pairing up two or more senses, we paired up playing cards with unique, colorful, and visceral symbols. We then used an animation technique called stop motion to manipulate the cards in ways that would be otherwise\nphysically impossible. And as the cards were flipping, shuffling, and sliding, we used a mixture of animation and reality to ensure that the symbols on the cards did their part to explain\nthe nuances of synesthesia. This type of animation is very\ndifficult to pull off without some planning first. A storyboard is a series of still images that basically serve as a road map for an animation from beginning to end. An animatic is a storyboard in motion. By making the animatic, we were able to review the digital\nmotion for each shot, which allowed us to progressively\nwork out timing, camera positioning, and, most importantly, any challenges we anticipated in the final animation process. How many hands do you need\nto shuffle a deck of cards? Here, we wanted to emphasize\neach nucleotide in the DNA sequence and stop motion allows for more control. By shuffling between individual frames, we could ensure that each card had a controlled amount of screen time, in this case, three frames, and that the card's placement\nwas consistent. But sometimes four hands\njust isn't enough. We use this trick a lot in this lesson, all thanks to one secret ingredient: Play-Doh! By molding the Play-Doh\ninto different sized pyramids, the cards can be held\nin different positions, always keeping the pyramid big enough to support the card, but small enough to not be seen and to not cast its own revealing shadow. Making an animated movie is like making a delicious layer cake. It's up to the animators to create the many planes, or layers. The use of green screen enables us to shoot\nindividual elements moving, and to later assemble those layers one on top of the other. Using software, we key\nout the green color, both on the background and Play-Doh. Layer the cards, add the hands, insert a background, and if you planned\nyour ingredients carefully, everything should come\ntogether just right. So, grab some fishing wire, glue, masking tape, chopsticks, and whatever else you can find.

Carlson", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/free-falling-in-outer-space-matt-j-carlson", "transcript": {"en": "Have you ever been floating\nin a swimming pool, all comfy and warm, thinking, \"Man, it'd be cool to be an astronaut! You could float out in outer space,\nlook down at the Earth and everything. It'd be so neat!\" Only that's not how it is at all. If you are in outer space,\nyou are orbiting the Earth: it's called free fall. You're actually falling towards the Earth. Think about this for a moment:\nthat's the feeling you get if you're going over the top\nof a roller coaster, going, like, \"Whoa!\" Only you're doing this the whole time you're orbiting the Earth, for two, three, four hours, days. Whatever it takes, right? So, how does orbiting work? Let's take a page from Isaac Newton. He had this idea,\na little mental experiment: You take a cannon, you put it on top of a hill. If you shoot the cannonball, it goes a little bit away. But if you shoot it harder, it goes far enough so that it lands a little bit past the curvature of Earth. Well, you can imagine if you shot\nit really, really, hard, it would go all the way around the Earth and come back -- boom! -- and hit you\nin the backside or something. Let's zoom way back\nand put you in a little satellite over the North Pole of the Earth and consider north to be up. You're going to fall down\nand hit the Earth. But you are actually moving\nsideways really fast. So when you fall down, you're going to miss. You're going to end up on the side\nof the Earth, falling down, and now the Earth is pulling\nyou back in sideways. So it's pulling you back in\nand you fall down, and so you miss the Earth again,\nand now you're under the Earth. The Earth is going to pull you up,\nbut you're moving sideways still. So you're going to miss the Earth again. Now you're on the other side\nof the Earth, moving upward, and the Earth's pulling you sideways. So you're going to fall sideways, but you're going to be moving up\nand so you'll miss. Now you're back on top of the Earth\nagain, over the North Pole, going sideways and falling down, and yep -- you guessed it. You'll keep missing\nbecause you're moving so fast. In this way, astronauts orbit the Earth. They're always falling towards the Earth, but they're always missing, and therefore,\nthey're falling all the time. They feel like they're falling,\nso you just have to get over it. So technically, if you ran\nfast enough and tripped, you could miss the Earth. But there's a big problem. First, you have to be going\neight kilometers a second. That's 18,000 miles an hour, just over Mach 23! The second problem: If you're going that fast, yes, you would orbit the Earth\nand come back where you came from, but there's a lot of air in the way, much less people and things. So you would burn up\ndue to atmospheric friction.

It's been estimated that the Plague decimated\nat least one-third of Europe's population. In a vain effort to stave off infection, the Italian-speaking port city of Ragusa, in what is now Croatia, mandated that ships arriving from Plague-infested areas remain isolated on the water until it was deemed likely that they weren't carrying a disease. This meant that the entire\ncontents of a ship and all of its passengers were often forced to remain on board for five or six weeks\nbefore being let ashore.

I can ignore most of the\ntime that Gary's shell is not a logarithmic spiral. But what I cannot forgive is\nthat SpongeBob's pineapple house is a mathematical\nimpossibility. There's three easy ways to\nfind spirals on a pineapple. There's the ones that\nwind up it going right, the ones that spiral\nup to the left, and the ones that go almost\nstraight up-- keyword almost. If you count the number\nof spirals going left and the number of\nspirals going right, they'll be adjacent\nFibonacci numbers-- 3 and 5, or 5 and 8, 8 and\n13, or 13 and 21. You claim that\nSpongeBob Squarepants lives in a pineapple under\nthe sea, but does he really? A true pineapple would\nhave Fibonacci spiral, so let's take a look. Because these\nimages of his house don't let us pick it\nup and turn it around to count the number of\nspirals going around it, it might be hard to figure out\nwhether it's mathematically a pineapple or not. But there's a huge clue in the\nthird spiral, the one going upwards. In this pineapple there's 8\nto the right, 13 to the left. You can add those\nnumbers together to get how many spirals\nare in the set spiraling steeply upwards. In this case, 21. The three sets of\nspirals in any pineapple are pretty much always\nadjacent Fibonacci numbers. The rare mutant cases might\nshow Lucas numbers or something, but it will always be three\nadjacent numbers in a series. What you'll never have\nis the same number of spirals both ways. Pineapples, unlike people,\ndon't have bilateral symmetry. You'll never have\nthat third spiral be not a spiral, but just\na straight line going up a pineapple. Yet, when we look at\nSpongeBob's supposed pineapple under the sea, it\nclearly has lines of pineapple things\ngoing straight up. It clearly has\nbilateral symmetry.
