Dombrowski", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-dark-history-of-iq-tests-stefan-c-dombrowski", "transcript": {"en": "In 1905, psychologists \nAlfred Binet and Théodore Simon designed a test for children \nwho were struggling in school in France. Designed to determine which children\nrequired individualized attention, their method formed \nthe basis of the IQ test. Beginning in the late 19th century, researchers hypothesized that cognitive\nabilities like verbal reasoning, working memory, and visual-spatial skills reflected an underlying \ngeneral intelligence, or g factor. Simon and Binet designed a battery of \ntests to measure each of these abilities and combine the results \ninto a single score. Questions were adjusted \nfor each age group, and a child’s score reflected how they \nperformed relative to others their age. Dividing someone’s score by their age \nand multiplying the result by 100 yielded the intelligence quotient, or IQ. Today, a score of 100 represents \nthe average of a sample population, with 68% of the population \nscoring within 15 points of 100. Simon and Binet thought the skills \ntheir test assessed would reflect general intelligence. But both then and now, there’s no single agreed upon \ndefinition of general intelligence. And that left the door open \nfor people to use the test in service of their own preconceived \nassumptions about intelligence. What started as a way to identify \nthose who needed academic help quickly became used to sort \npeople in other ways, often in service of deeply flawed \nideologies. One of the first large-scale \nimplementations occurred in the United States during WWI, \nwhen the military used an IQ test to sort recruits and screen \nthem for officer training. At that time, many people \nbelieved in eugenics, the idea that desirable \nand undesirable genetic traits could and should be controlled \nin humans through selective breeding. There were many problems \nwith this line of thinking, among them the idea that intelligence\nwas not only fixed and inherited, but also linked to a person’s race. Under the influence of eugenics, scientists used the results \nof the military initiative to make erroneous claims \nthat certain racial groups were intellectually superior to others. Without taking into account \nthat many of the recruits tested were new immigrants to the United States who lacked formal education \nor English language exposure, they created an erroneous \nintelligence hierarchy of ethnic groups. The intersection of eugenics and IQ\ntesting influenced not only science, but policy as well. In 1924, the state of Virginia \ncreated policy allowing for the forced sterilization \nof people with low IQ scores— a decision the United States \nSupreme Court upheld. In Nazi Germany, the government \nauthorized the murder of children based on low IQ. Following the Holocaust \nand the Civil Rights Movement, the discriminatory uses of IQ tests were challenged on both \nmoral and scientific grounds. Scientists began to gather evidence \nof environmental impacts on IQ. For example, as IQ tests were periodically\nrecalibrated over the 20th century, new generations scored consistently\nhigher on old tests than each previous generation. This phenomenon, \nknown as the Flynn Effect, happened much too fast to be caused \nby inherited evolutionary traits. Instead, the cause was likely \nenvironmental— improved education, \nbetter healthcare, and better nutrition. In the mid-twentieth century, psychologists also attempted \nto use IQ tests to evaluate things other than \ngeneral intelligence, particularly schizophrenia, depression,\nand other psychiatric conditions. These diagnoses relied in part on \nthe clinical judgment of the evaluators, and used a subset of the tests \nused to determine IQ— a practice later research found does \nnot yield clinically useful information. Today, IQ tests employ many similar\ndesign elements and types of questions as the early tests, though we have better techniques for\nidentifying potential bias in the test. They’re no longer used to diagnose\npsychiatric conditions. But a similarly problematic practice \nusing subtest scores is still sometimes used to diagnose\nlearning disabilities, against the advice of many experts. Psychologists around the world \nstill use IQ tests to identify intellectual disability, and the results can be used \nto determine appropriate educational support,\njob training, and assisted living. IQ test results have been used \nto justify horrific policies and scientifically baseless ideologies. That doesn’t mean the test itself \nis worthless— in fact, it does a good job of measuring\nthe reasoning and problem-solving skills it sets out to. But that isn’t the same thing \nas measuring a person’s potential. Though there are many complicated\npolitical, historical, scientific, and cultural issues wrapped up \nin IQ testing, more and more researchers \nagree on this point, and reject the notion that individuals\ncan be categorized by a single numerical score."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Intelligence tests (IQ tests) were used by the US military during WWI for what purpose?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To create a master race"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To determine who had officer potential"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To determine whether women should enter the military"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To determine the maximum age to be drafted"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "IQ tests were originally created by Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon for what purpose?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To determine which race was intellectually superior"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To determine who should become a military officer or a private on the front lines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To determine which groups of people were genetically superior"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To determine who could benefit from education"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following statements about IQ tests is INACCURATE?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "During the 1920’s it was thought that IQ tests could be used to make decisions about individuals who should be sterilized"}, {"label": "B", "text": "During the 1920’s it was thought that IQ tests could be used to determine which groups of people were genetically superior"}, {"label": "C", "text": "During the 1920’s it was thought that IQ tests yielded results that were predominantly genetically determined, fix, and immutable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "During the 1920’s IQ tests were used to predict who might run for president"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In the past, IQ tests have been used inappropriately for which purpose?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Placement on athletic teams"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Determine hair color"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Diagnose depression and other psychiatric conditions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Determine who might be a good parent"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the is an appropriate use for an IQ test?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Determine who should receive a classification of intellectual disability"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Determine who should receive a classification of learning disabilities"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Determine who is destined for a life full of success"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Determine who is likely to receive a psychiatric classification such as depression or ADHD"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Rhode Island Main New Hampshire Massachusetts people came mainly from England for Religious Freedom to practice their religion the way they needed but to raise a family and try to feed them could prove to be difficult and for a few reasons soil was Rocky the climate cold they could barely grow more food than the bellies could hold so to make money they wailed and fished and from All the lumber there they built ships and since they needed a trade Boston became a port city that's how they got paid hey in New England had Town meetings in the meeting house that's where people found seating the men discussed the issues of the town and the meeting hous is where church services went down now religion was a major inspiration and it was integrated in kids education lastly for black people living

work okay and it hurts when we mention blacks some were free some were slave laborers breaking their backs and the climate was more mild it was wild the wheat and many grain stockpile plus they had Factory supplying the people with paper textiles and iron and big cities like New York and Philly had merchants and Artisans of all kinds really now Maryland Virginia North and South Carolina and Georgia the southern colonies where you'll find a climate that's much warmer than up north and with rich soil they GRE crops of all sorts of course in the southern colonies plantations were the base of their economy large Farms where cash crops were produced like cotton rice and tobacco and they used the labor of African slaves who were taken from their home countries and forced on the plantation

This first text structures is called Description it described the topic and its characteristics You'll se \"such as\" and \"for example\" and details and adjectives like in this sample Leaning tower of pisa is located in Italy Mamma, Mia It stands over 180 feet tall, tilted four degrees like it's starting to fall That's description. The author described [describe] the tower so you have the image in your mind now peep this, the structure called sequence it gives events from way back to most recent. Construction began in 1173, but 1173 but it was halted when war was decreed. Building stoped for a while, then resumed Many years later in 1272. Sequence contains dates and the words Next then before first second and third. Cause and effect is another way to organize Its when authors tell what happened and why Soft soil made the tower settle unevenly. As a result, it leaned increasingly. Builders tried to balance it with more floors But due to extra [weight] it [leans] [even] [more] [words] like [because] since if then due to Right to you. In text, I find description Sequence, cause and effect. We can compare and contrast all day, all day There's a problem and solution I bet. all day, all day. There's a problem and solution. And I bet if you heard the hook you already know there's two more tech structures to go sometimes the author introduces a problem and then Explains how somebody solved it, the tower leans more With each [passing] century. The tilt increased to more than five degrees. The people feared it would collapse into ruins. Now we know the problem what's the solution? [Earth] was removed from under the monument and weights were added to balance out the top of it They directed the lean- at least a little bit that problem and solution not a riddle, kid. Just look out for the words involved. Since question question problem solution and solve. I got another text you don't have to ask and its text structure? Compare and contrast. It explains how things are different in the same with the words in bold I'm about to say both the tower of Pisa's construction and the Washington monument saw disruption. The Washington monument, Named after George, had constuction paused for the Civil War. But the purposes of the buildings were different One was erected as a church bell tower while the other honored a Founding Father There we compared the two differenct structures thats five text structures in 1/16 of an hour In text, I find description, sequence, cause and effect.

{"page": 14, "lesson": 6, "title": "The wildly complex anatomy of a sneaker - Angel Chang", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-life-cycle-of-a-sneaker-angel-chang", "transcript": {"en": "Australians call them “runners.\" \nThe British know them as “trainers.\" Americans refer to them as “tennis shoes” \nor “sneakers.\" Whatever you call them, \nthese rubber-soled, casual shoes are worn by billions of people \naround the world. Originally invented \nin the late 19th century, these simple canvas and rubber creations \nhave changed a lot since they first hit the pavement. Today, sneaker consumption \nis at an all-time high. No country buys more sneakers \nthan the United States, where people purchase 3 pairs \na year on average. To meet this demand, roughly 23 billion \nshoes are produced each year, mostly in factories \nacross China and Southeast Asia. But making shoes has become \nmore complicated, more labor-intensive, and in some ways, more dangerous, for the workers involved \nand for our planet. Shoe manufacturing \naccounts for roughly one-fifth of the fashion industry’s \ncarbon emissions. Sneakers alone generate 313 million \nmetric tons of carbon dioxide every year, which is equivalent to the annual \nemissions of 66 million cars. To better understand \nyour shoe’s carbon footprint, let’s dive into the anatomy of a sneaker. For starters, the heel, insole, \nmidsole, and upper layer are usually made from synthetic textiles \nlike polyester, nylon, latex, and polyurethane. Mining the fossil fuels that make up these\nmaterials emits tons of greenhouse gases. And processing those raw ingredients \ninto synthetic textiles also uses a lot of energy,\nfurther compounding that pollution. Some sneaker tops are made from \nnatural sources like leather, but tanning this material \nrelies on chromium; a carcinogenic chemical that can damage \nfreshwater ecosystems. The outer soles of most shoes \nare made of rubber that’s gone through a process \ncalled vulcanization. This technique adds sulfur to superheated \nraw rubber to create a material that’s both elastic and sturdy. Until recently, sneakers used \nnatural rubber for this process. But today, most outer soles are made \nwith a synthetic blend of natural rubber and byproducts from coal and oil. Producing these materials accounts \nfor 20% of a sneaker’s carbon footprint. But more than two-thirds of the shoe’s \ncarbon impact comes from the next step: manufacturing. A typical sneaker is comprised \nof 65 discrete parts, each of which is produced \nby specialized machinery. This means it’s cheaper for factories \nto mass-produce each piece separately rather than manufacturing \nevery part under one roof. But the transportation \nrequired to ship these pieces to one assembly plant emits even more CO2. Once the components arrive \nat the assembly line, they undergo cutting, pouring, melting, \nbaking, cooling, and gluing, before the final products \ncan be stitched together. The assembly of a typical sneaker \nrequires more than 360 steps, and accounts for the remaining 20% \nof a sneaker’s environmental impact. The dispersion of factories fuels \nanother problem as well: labor abuse. Most brands don’t own \nor operate their factories, so the plants they work with \nare in countries with little to no worker protection laws. As a result, many laborers \nearn below the living wage, and are exposed to harmful chemicals, \nlike toxic glue fumes. When manufacturing is complete, the shoes are packaged and transported \nto stores around the globe. For many, these shoes could last years. But for someone running 20 miles a week, a pair of running shoes will start \nwearing out after roughly 6 months. Since the shoes are made of \nso many different materials, they’re almost impossible to break down \ninto recyclable components. 20% of these shoes are incinerated, \nwhile the rest are tossed into landfills where they can take up to 1,000 years \nto degrade. So, how can we balance \nour love of sneakers with the need for sustainability? First, designers should streamline \ndesign elements and focus on eco-friendly materials. Factories need to develop energy efficient\nmanufacturing processes that consolidate steps and sneaker parts. And consumers should support \ncompanies using clean energy and ethical manufacturing processes. We can also buy fewer shoes, \nwear them for longer, and donate those we no longer need. So no matter what your style, we can all \ntake steps towards a sustainable future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which step in the shoe production process contributes to the majority of a sneaker’s carbon footprint?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Materials"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Manufacturing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Assembly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Shipping"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries on the planet.

I don't know anything else about him, except that he once saved my life by putting his own life in danger. This man ran across four lanes of freeway\ntraffic in the middle of the night to bring me back to safety after a car accident\nthat could have killed me. And the whole thing\nleft me really shaken up, obviously, but it also left me with this\nkind of burning, gnawing need to understand why he did it, what forces within him\ncaused him to make the choice that I owe my life to, to risk his own life\nto save the life of a stranger? In other words, what are the causes of his\nor anybody else's capacity for altruism? But first let me tell you what happened. That night, I was 19 years old and driving back to my home\nin Tacoma, Washington, down the Interstate 5 freeway, when a little dog\ndarted out in front of my car. And I did exactly\nwhat you're not supposed to do, which is swerve to avoid it. And I discovered why\nyou're not supposed to do that. I hit the dog anyways, and that sent the car into a fishtail, and then a spin across the freeway, until finally it wound up\nin the fast lane of the freeway faced backwards into oncoming traffic and then the engine died. And I was sure in that moment\nthat I was about to die too, but I didn't because of the actions\nof that one brave man who must have made the decision within a fraction of a second\nof seeing my stranded car to pull over and run\nacross four lanes of freeway traffic in the dark to save my life. And then after he got my car working again and got me back to safety\nand made sure I was going to be all right, he drove off again. He never even told me his name, and I'm pretty sure\nI forgot to say thank you. So before I go any further, I really want to take a moment to stop and say thank you\nto that stranger. (Applause) I tell you all of this because the events of that night changed\nthe course of my life to some degree. I became a psychology researcher, and I've devoted my work to understanding\nthe human capacity to care for others. Where does it come from,\nand how does it develop, and what are the extreme forms\nthat it can take? These questions are really important\nto understanding basic aspects of human social nature. A lot of people,\nand this includes everybody from philosophers\nand economists to ordinary people believe that human nature\nis fundamentally selfish, that we're only ever really motivated\nby our own welfare. But if that's true, why do some people,\nlike the stranger who rescued me, do selfless things,\nlike helping other people at enormous risk and cost to themselves? Answering this question requires exploring the roots\nof extraordinary acts of altruism, and what might make people\nwho engage in such acts different than other people. But until recently, very little work\non this topic had been done. The actions of the man who rescued me meet the most stringent\ndefinition of altruism, which is a voluntary, costly behavior motivated by the desire\nto help another individual. So it's a selfless act\nintended to benefit only the other. What could possibly\nexplain an action like that? One answer is compassion, obviously, which is a key driver of altruism. But then the question becomes, why do some people\nseem to have more of it than others? And the answer may be that the brains\nof highly altruistic people are different in fundamental ways. But to figure out how, I actually started from the opposite end, with psychopaths. A common approach to understanding\nbasic aspects of human nature, like the desire to help other people, is to study people\nin whom that desire is missing, and psychopaths are exactly such a group. Psychopathy is a developmental disorder with strongly genetic origins, and it results in a personality\nthat's cold and uncaring and a tendency to engage in antisocial\nand sometimes very violent behavior. Once my colleagues and I\nat the National Institute of Mental Health conducted some of the first ever\nbrain imaging research of psychopathic adolescents, and our findings, and the findings\nof other researchers now, have shown that people\nwho are psychopathic pretty reliably exhibit\nthree characteristics. First, although they're not generally\ninsensitive to other people's emotions, they are insensitive to signs\nthat other people are in distress. And in particular, they have difficulty recognizing\nfearful facial expressions like this one. And fearful expressions convey\nurgent need and emotional distress, and they usually elicit\ncompassion and a desire to help in people who see them, so it makes sense that people\nwho tend to lack compassion also tend to be insensitive to these cues. The part of the brain that's the most important\nfor recognizing fearful expressions is called the amygdala. There are very rare cases of people\nwho lack amygdalas completely, and they're profoundly impaired\nin recognizing fearful expressions. And whereas healthy adults and children usually show big spikes\nin amygdala activity when they look at fearful expressions, psychopaths' amygdalas\nare underreactive to these expressions. Sometimes they don't react at all, which may be why they have\ntrouble detecting these cues. Finally, psychopaths' amygdalas\nare smaller than average by about 18 or 20 percent. So all of these findings\nare reliable and robust, and they're very interesting. But remember that my main interest is not understanding\nwhy people don't care about others. It's understanding why they do. So the real question is, could extraordinary altruism, which is the opposite of psychopathy in terms of compassion\nand the desire to help other people, emerge from a brain that is also\nthe opposite of psychopathy? A sort of antipsychopathic brain, better able to recognize\nother people's fear, an amygdala that's more reactive\nto this expression and maybe larger than average as well? As my research has now shown, all three things are true. And we discovered this by testing a population\nof truly extraordinary altruists. These are people who have given\none of their own kidneys to a complete stranger. So these are people who have volunteered\nto undergo major surgery so that one of their own\nhealthy kidneys can be removed and transplanted into a very ill stranger that they've never met and may never meet. \"Why would anybody do this?\"\nis a very common question. And the answer may be that the brains of these\nextraordinary altruists have certain special characteristics. They are better at recognizing\nother people's fear. They're literally better at detecting\nwhen somebody else is in distress. This may be in part because their amygdala\nis more reactive to these expressions. And remember, this is the same part\nof the brain that we found was underreactive\nin people who are psychopathic. And finally, their amygdalas\nare larger than average as well, by about eight percent. So together, what these data suggest is the existence of something\nlike a caring continuum in the world that's anchored at the one end\nby people who are highly psychopathic, and at the other by people\nwho are very compassionate and driven to acts of extreme altruism. But I should add that what makes\nextraordinary altruists so different is not just that they're\nmore compassionate than average. They are, but what's even more unusual about them is that they're compassionate\nand altruistic not just towards people\nwho are in their own innermost circle of friends and family. Right? Because to have compassion for people\nthat you love and identify with is not extraordinary. Truly extraordinary altruists' compassion\nextends way beyond that circle, even beyond their wider\ncircle of acquaintances to people who are outside\ntheir social circle altogether, total strangers, just like the man who rescued me. And I've had the opportunity now\nto ask a lot of altruistic kidney donors how it is that they manage to generate\nsuch a wide circle of compassion that they were willing to give\na complete stranger their kidney. And I found it's a really difficult\nquestion for them to answer. I say, \"How is it that\nyou're willing to do this thing when so many other people don't? You're one of fewer than 2,000 Americans who has ever given a kidney to a stranger. What is it that makes you so special?\" And what do they say? They say, \"Nothing. There's nothing special about me. I'm just the same as everybody else.\" And I think that's actually\na really telling answer, because it suggests that the circles\nof these altruists don't look like this, they look more like this. They have no center. These altruists literally\ndon't think of themselves as being at the center of anything, as being better or more inherently\nimportant than anybody else. When I asked one altruist\nwhy donating her kidney made sense to her, she said, \"Because it's not about me.\" Another said, \"I'm not different. I'm not unique. Your study here is going to find out\nthat I'm just the same as you.\" I think the best description\nfor this amazing lack of self-centeredness is humility, which is that quality\nthat in the words of St. Augustine makes men as angels. And why is that? It's because if there's\nno center of your circle, there can be no inner rings\nor outer rings, nobody who is more or less worthy\nof your care and compassion than anybody else. And I think that this is what really\ndistinguishes extraordinary altruists from the average person. But I also think that this is a view\nof the world that's attainable by many and maybe even most people. And I think this\nbecause at the societal level, expansions of altruism and compassion\nare already happening everywhere. The psychologist Steven Pinker\nand others have shown that all around the world people\nare becoming less and less accepting of suffering in ever-widening\ncircles of others, which has led to declines\nof all kinds of cruelty and violence, from animal abuse to domestic violence\nto capital punishment. And it's led to increases\nin all kinds of altruism. A hundred years ago, people\nwould have thought it was ludicrous how normal and ordinary it is for people to donate\ntheir blood and bone marrow to complete strangers today. Is it possible that\na hundred years from now people will think\nthat donating a kidney to a stranger is just as normal and ordinary as we think donating blood\nand bone marrow is today? Maybe. So what's at the root\nof all these amazing changes? In part it seems to be increases in wealth\nand standards of living. As societies become\nwealthier and better off, people seem to turn\ntheir focus of attention outward, and as a result, all kinds of altruism\ntowards strangers increases, from volunteering to charitable donations\nand even altruistic kidney donations. But all of these changes also yield a strange and paradoxical result, which is that even as the world is\nbecoming a better and more humane place, which it is, there's a very common perception\nthat it's becoming worse and more cruel, which it's not. And I don't know exactly why this is, but I think it may be\nthat we now just know so much more about the suffering\nof strangers in distant places, and so we now care a lot more about the suffering\nof those distant strangers. But what's clear is the kinds\nof changes we're seeing show that the roots of altruism and compassion are just as much a part of human nature\nas cruelty and violence, maybe even more so, and while some people do seem\nto be inherently more sensitive to the suffering of distant others, I really believe that the ability\nto remove oneself from the center of the circle and expand the circle of compassion\noutward to include even strangers is within reach for almost everyone.

{"page": 14, "lesson": 13, "title": "Better know the Mona Lisa", "category": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/7bvFFKkl", "transcript": {"en": "NARRATOR: Jay-Z and\nBeyonce posed with her. Kardashians posed with her. So did Tony Danza,\nCara Delevingne, even Richard Simmons. Nat King Cole sang about\nher; so did will.i.am. She was famously stolen in 1911. Marcel Duchamp\nparodied her in 1919. Someone more recently\nmade a towel out of her. But who is she? Why, after centuries, do we\ncontinue to flock to her? Let's better know the Mona Lisa. Leonardo da Vinci-- yep, the\noriginal Renaissance man, who painted \"The Last\nSupper\" and was also an inventor, architect,\nengineer, and scientist-- began the portrait in 1533,\nwhile living in Florence. It was the height of\nthe Italian Renaissance, when a mounting interest in\nhumanism, as well as a growing merchant class with\ndisposable income, had popularized\nportrait-painting. We call it the \"Mona\nLisa,\" \"Mona\" being short for \"Madonna,\" or\n\"lady,\" and his subject is almost definitely Lisa del\nGiocondo, a Florentine who married a cloth merchant\nat the age of 15 and would have been about\n24 when it was painted. Italians call the painting \"La\nGioconda,\" the feminine form of her married name. And the French likewise\ncall it \"La Joconde,\" which conveniently invokes\nthe Latin \"jocundus\" and its derivatives, meaning\n\"pleasant\" or \"agreeable.\" Lisa's husband,\nFrancesco, likely commissioned the portrait on\nthe occasion of their moving into a new home, or\npossibly after the birth of one of their children. But the portrait never\nactually got to them. Francesco might not\nhave paid for it, or Leonardo could have\nput off finishing it for a more important commission. But the painting remained\nin the artist's possession until his death\nin 1519, after he had joined the royal court of\nKing Francois I. From there, the painting became the\nproperty of the king. And, after a stay at\nVersailles, it eventually made its way to the Louvre,\nin the late 18th century. There it has remained-- except\nwhen this guy walked it out of the museum, under his\nshirt, hid it for two years, and then tried to\nreturn the painting to an Italian museum which he\nfelt was its rightful home. Then it was back to the Louvre,\nuntil World War II came along, and it was shuffled around\nFrance for safekeeping, sometimes even on a\nstretcher in an ambulance. It went from a chateau\nin the Loire valley, to an abbey in the\nsouth of France, to museums farther south,\nuntil it could finally be returned to Paris\nafter the end of the war. While many portraits of\nthe time were more closely cropped and painted\nin profile, Lisa is oriented more frontally\nand shown in half length. Her hands are included, with\nher right resting delicately over top the left. And she's dressed\nfairly unremarkably-- not trying to show off\nwith the latest trends. She's seated in a chair, in a\nloggia, or an open-air room, which looks out\nover a landscape. It was made with oil paint on\nwood panel, using a technique Leonardo liked\ncalled \"sfumato\"-- what a great word! Say it with me-- \"sfumato\"-- which is the kind\nof smudgy, smoky haziness you see, especially\naround her eyes and mouth. It contributes to the\nsoftness and realness of Lisa but also gives an\natmospheric effect that is almost otherworldly. He used the same effect\nin some biblical scenes. You see it here in the shading\naround the Virgin Mary's neck. But our decidedly\nsecular subject, Lisa, while rendered hazily, is\nlooking directly out at us-- and with her famous\nsmile, if that's what you call this expression. In 2005, researchers\nran the image through emotion-recognition\nsoftware, which rated features like curvature around the lips\nand crinkles around the eyes, finding the expression to\nbe 83% happy, 9% disgusted, 6% fearful, 2% angry, less than\n1% neutral, and 0% surprised. So it's a smile, but\nit's not an empty smile. There's a knowingness to it--\na smile in spite of everything, as if she knows she's\ncaught in this painting, in her own turbulent time,\nlooking out at us, whoever we are, in our turbulent time. Which is perhaps what makes\nit so indelible an image. It has always been one of\nthe treasures of the Louvre collection, but it wasn't\nuntil after its 1911 theft that it reached superstardom. In the two days after\nit was returned, more than 100,000\npeople came to see it. And they really haven't\nstopped since then, with millions meeting\nher gaze each year. Many copies of the\npainting exist, and much debate about\nwho painted them. Researchers recently found\nthat one version, at the Prado, was probably painted\nby an artist sitting right next to Leonardo,\nfollowing his actions, stroke by stroke. But even that one,\nwhile striking, doesn't capture the mystery\nand majesty of the original. There are nude Mona Lisas\nand, of course, many plays on the original, with\nartists from Botero, who painted a Lisa at\nage 12 and as an adult, and Warhol, who\ndrew the connection between this original celebrity\nand the subjects of more recent paparazzi. It doesn't appear that our\nattention to this painting is waning. In fact, it might even be\nrising, as the internet offers us countless reproductions,\nreinterpretations, merchandisfications,\nand bastardisations. Which raises the question\nof whether, at this point, the \"Mona Lisa\" is\nfamous primarily because it's a masterpiece\nor famous primarily because it's famous. It may be that our\nidentification with Lisa is more intense than\never, as we see around us more and more\nimages of ourselves looking out, staring into\nthe eyes of unknown millions.

{"page": 14, "lesson": 15, "title": "Helping others makes us happier— but it matters how we do it - Elizabeth Dunn", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/G6OhrUdU", "transcript": {"en": "So, I have a pretty fun job, which is to figure out\nwhat makes people happy. It's so fun, it might almost seen\na little frivolous, especially at a time where\nwe're being confronted with some pretty depressing headlines. But it turns out that studying happiness\nmight provide a key to solving some of the toughest\nproblems we're facing. It's taken me almost a decade\nto figure this out. Pretty early on in my career, I published a paper in \"Science\"\nwith my collaborators, entitled, \"Spending Money\non Others Promotes Happiness.\" I was very confident in this conclusion, except for one thing: it didn't seem to apply to me. (Laughter) I hardly ever gave money to charity, and when I did, I didn't feel that warm glow\nI was expecting. So I started to wonder if maybe\nthere was something wrong with my research or something wrong with me. My own lackluster emotional response\nto giving was especially puzzling because my follow-up studies revealed\nthat even toddlers exhibited joy from giving to others. In one experiment, my colleagues\nKiley Hamlin, Lara Aknin and I brought kids just under\nthe age of two into the lab. Now, as you might imagine, we had to work with a resource\nthat toddlers really care about, so we used the toddler equivalent of gold, namely, Goldfish crackers. (Laughter) We gave kids this windfall\nof Goldfish for themselves and a chance to give\nsome of their Goldfish away to a puppet named Monkey. (Video) Researcher: I found\neven more treats, and I'm going to give them all to you. Toddler: Ooh. Thank you. Researcher: But, you know,\nI don't see any more treats. Will you give one to Monkey? Toddler: Yeah.\nResearcher: Yeah? Toddler: Yeah. Here. Researcher: Ooh, yummy. Mmmm. Toddler: All gone, he ate it. Elizabeth Dunn: Now, we trained\nresearch assistants to watch these videos and code toddlers' emotional reactions. Of course, we didn't tell them\nour hypotheses. The data revealed that toddlers\nwere pretty happy when they got this pile\nof Goldfish for themselves, but they were actually even happier when they got to give\nsome of their Goldfish away. And this warm glow of giving\npersists into adulthood. When we analyzed surveys\nfrom more than 200,000 adults across the globe, we saw that nearly a third\nof the world's population reported giving at least some money\nto charity in the past month. Remarkably, in every\nmajor region of the world, people who gave money to charity\nwere happier than those who did not, even after taking into account\ntheir own personal financial situation. And this correlation wasn't trivial. It looked like giving to charity made about the same\ndifference for happiness as having twice as much income. Now, as a researcher, if you're lucky enough\nto stumble on an effect that replicates around the world\nin children and adults alike, you start to wonder: Could this be part of human nature? We know that pleasure\nreinforces adaptive behaviors like eating and sex that help perpetuate our species, and it looked to me like giving\nmight be one of those behaviors. I was really excited about these ideas, and I wrote about them\nin the \"New York Times.\" One of the people who read this article was my accountant. (Laughter) Yeah. At tax time, I found myself\nseated across from him, watching as he slowly tapped his pen on the charitable giving line\nof my tax return with this look of, like, poorly concealed disapproval. (Laughter) Despite building my career\nby showing how great giving can feel, I actually wasn't doing very much of it. So I resolved to give more. Around that time, devastating stories about\nthe Syrian refugee crisis were everywhere. I really wanted to help, so I pulled out my credit card. I knew my donations would probably\nmake a difference for someone somewhere, but going to the website\nof an effective charity and entering my Visa number still just didn't feel like enough. That's when I learned\nabout the Group of Five. The Canadian government\nallows any five Canadians to privately sponsor a family of refugees. You have to raise enough money\nto support the family for their first year in Canada, and then they literally\nget on a plane to your city. One of the things that I think\nis so cool about this program is that no one is allowed to do it alone. And instead of a Group of Five, we ended up partnering\nwith a community organization and forming a group of 25. After almost two years\nof paperwork and waiting, we learned that our family\nwould be arriving in Vancouver in less than six weeks. They had four sons and a daughter, so we raced to find them a place to live. We were very lucky to find them a house, but it needed quite a bit of work. So my friends came out\non evenings and weekends and painted and cleaned\nand assembled furniture. When the big day came, we filled their fridge\nwith milk and fresh fruit and headed to the airport\nto meet our family. It was a little overwhelming for everyone, especially the four-year-old. His mother was reunited with her sister who had come to Canada earlier\nthrough the same program. They hadn't seen each other in 15 years. When you hear that more than\n5.6 million refugees have fled Syria, you're faced with this tragedy that the human brain hasn't really\nevolved to comprehend. It's so abstract. Before, if any of us had been asked\nto donate 15 hours a month to help out with the refugee crisis, we probably would have said no. But as soon as we took our family\nto their new home in Vancouver, we all had the same realization: we were just going to do whatever it took\nto help them be happy. This experience made me think\na little more deeply about my research. Back in my lab, we'd seen the benefits of giving spike when people felt a real sense\nof connection with those they were helping and could easily envision\nthe difference they were making in those individuals' lives. For example, in one experiment, we gave participants an opportunity\nto donate a bit of money to either UNICEF or Spread the Net. We chose these charities intentionally, because they were partners and shared\nthe same critically important goal of promoting children's health. But I think UNICEF is just\nsuch a big, broad charity that it can be a little hard to envision how your own small donation\nwill make a difference. In contrast, Spread the Net\noffers donors a concrete promise: for every 10 dollars donated, they provide one bed net\nto protect a child from malaria. We saw that the more money\npeople gave to Spread the Net, the happier they reported\nfeeling afterward. In contrast, this emotional\nreturn on investment was completely eliminated\nwhen people gave money to UNICEF. So this suggests that just\ngiving money to a worthwhile charity isn't always enough. You need to be able to envision how, exactly, your dollars\nare going to make a difference. Of course, the Group of Five program\ntakes this idea to a whole new level. When we first took on this project, we would talk about when\nthe refugees would arrive. Now, we just refer to them as our family. Recently, we took the kids ice skating, and later that day,\nmy six-year-old, Oliver, asked me, \"Mommy, who is the oldest\nkid in our family?\" I assumed he was talking\nabout his plethora of cousins, and he was talking about them, but also about our Syrian family. Since our family arrived, so many people and organizations\nhave offered to help, providing everything\nfrom free dental fillings to summer camps. It's made me see the goodness\nthat exists in our community. Thanks to one donation, the kids got to go to bike camp, and every day of the week, some member of our group\ntried to be there to cheer for them. I happened to be there the day the training wheels\nwere supposed to come off, and let me tell you, the four-year-old\ndid not think this was a good idea. So I went over and talked to him about the long-term benefits\nof riding without training wheels. (Laughter) Then I remembered that he was four\nand barely spoke English. So I reverted to two words\nhe definitely knew: ice cream. You try without training wheels,\nI'll buy you ice cream. Here's what happened next. (Video) ED: Yes. Yeah! Kid: I'm gonna try. ED: Oh my God! Look at you go! (Squealing) Look at you go!\nYou're doing it all by yourself! (Audience) (Laughter) (Video) ED: Good job! (Audience) (Laughter) (Applause) ED: So this is the kind of helping\nthat human beings evolved to enjoy, but for 40 years, Canada was the only country in the world that allowed private citizens\nto sponsor refugees. Now -- Canada! (Applause) It's pretty great. Now Australia and the UK\nare starting up similar programs. Just imagine how different\nthe refugee crisis could look if more countries made this possible. Creating these kinds of meaningful\nconnections between individuals provides an opportunity\nto deal with challenges that feel overwhelming. One of those challenges lies just blocks\nfrom where I'm standing right now, in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. By some measures, it's the poorest\nurban postal code in Canada. We actually debated whether\nto bring over a family of refugees, because there are so many people\nright here already struggling. My friend Evan told me\nthat when he was a kid and his parents drove\nthrough this neighborhood, he would duck down in the back seat. But Evan's parents\nnever would have guessed that when he grew up, he would open up the doors\nof a local restaurant and invite this community inside\nto enjoy three-course dinners. The program that Evan helped build\nis called \"Plenty of Plates,\" and the goal is not just\nto provide free meals but to create moments of connection between people who otherwise\nmight never make eye contact. Each night, a local business\nsponsors the dinner and sends a team of volunteers who help make and serve the meal. Afterward, the leftovers get distributed\nto people who are out on the street, and importantly, there's enough money left to provide a thousand free lunches\nfor this community in the days that follow. But the benefits of this program\nextend beyond food. For the volunteers, it provides\nan opportunity to engage with people, to sit down and hear their stories. After this experience,\none volunteer changed his commute so that instead of avoiding\nthis neighborhood, he walks through it, smiling or making eye contact\nas he passes familiar faces. All of us are capable\nof finding joy in giving. But we shouldn't expect this\nto happen automatically. Spending money helping others\ndoesn't necessarily promote happiness. Instead, it matters how we do it. And if we want people to give more, we need to subvert the way we think\nabout charitable giving. We need to create opportunities to give that enable us to appreciate\nour shared humanity. If any of you work for a charity, don't reward your donors\nwith pens or calendars. (Applause) Reward them with the opportunity to see the specific impact\nthat their generosity is having and to connect with the individuals\nand communities they're helping. We're used to thinking about giving\nas something we should do. And it is. But in thinking about it this way, we're missing out on one of\nthe best parts of being human: that we have evolved to find joy\nin helping others. Let's stop thinking about giving\nas just this moral obligation and start thinking of it\nas a source of pleasure. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Researchers argue that the warm glow of giving may be a fundamental part of human nature.

This torrent flows from the Bradbarrier\nall the way to Huxenborg. There an entire city’s worth of factories build the robots \nand house the Node of Memory, the last of the three powerful artifacts \nEthic needs to collect. After a long day and a longer night they find themselves \nin a canyon of brick and steel. Just when they’re about to reach \nthe end of the line, a rope catches them. Their savior, Lemma, \nhas been waiting for them. When Ethic claimed the Node of Creation \nfrom the forest tower, radios all across the land \ncame back to life. Adila, the resistance leader, \nimmediately started contacting her allies, none more important than Lemma, a brilliant scientist working from within\nHuxenborg to bring down the machines. Unfortunately, the radios \nalso tipped off the robots. So they’ve taken defensive measures to protect the final artifact in its home \nin the very heart of the city. There’s only one way to get there: \nthe gauntlet of forking paths. It’s a deadly series of luminous conveyors\nthat wind underneath Huxenborg. Starting from the current position, each section runs for a distance, \nthen splits in two. Every branch does the same thing, \nagain and again. There are thousands of branches. Only one path leads to the artifact; \nall the others to destruction. Fortunately, the Node of Creation \nhas granted Hedge a strange power: he can produce slightly smaller versions \nof himself. Each version can do only two things: \nradio information back to its parent, and produce slightly smaller \nversions of itself… which can do the same two things, \nas can their children, for as many generations as needed. A patrol is closing in on their position, \nso Ethic’s time is limited. What instructions should she give \nHedge to find the one safe path? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Hint in 3 Hint in 2 Hint in 1 Programmers have an elegant tool \nin their arsenal called recursion. Recursion is when you have a set of \ninstructions that refers back to itself. It’s like using a word \nin its own definition, except where that’s frowned upon,\nthis is incredibly effective. Recursion involves repetition, \nbut in a different way than loops. Where a loop takes one action \nand repeats it again and again, recursion will start an action, \nand before it’s finished, use it again, and before that’s finished, \nuse it again, and so on. It keeps doing this until \nsome end state is reached. It then passes the information back up,\nlayer after layer, until it reaches the top \nand ends the cycle. Recursion is ideal for problems \nthat involve self-similarity, where each part resembles \nthe larger whole. Like, for example, a deadly defense \nsystem designed to end any person or thing who dares tread upon it. Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Solution in 3 Solution in 2 Solution in 1 Ethic’s conundrum seems sprawling \non the surface, but there’s a remarkably simple\nsolution to it using recursion. In order to find it, let’s first look \nat the simplest version of this puzzle: what if the entire maze \nwere just two paths? If Hedge copies himself, the copy \nthat goes the wrong way will be destroyed. So the other one, \nwhich will reach the artifact, can radio back the path it took,\nand then no matter which way is correct, that’s the answer Hedge will receive. This is called the \"base case\"\nof the recursion. Now, suppose the maze \nbranches twice from the starting point, and at every intersection, \nHedge’s copies— let’s call them Twig 1 and Twig 2— make more copies— \nlet’s call them Leaves 1 through 4. Three Leaves will be destroyed. The one that reaches the artifact \nwill radio back the right answer, but only to its parent. So if Twig 1 or 2 is waiting \nat an intersection and hears something over the radio, that’s the right way to go \nto the artifact from where it is. To tell Hedge the right answer \nfrom his perspective, the Twig should say which way it went, and then the route \nit just heard over the radio. This same process will work no matter \nhow many times the maze branches. Any answer a copy hears on the radio must be the way to the control room \nfrom its location, and if it then adds the branch it took, it can tell its parent \nhow to get there as well. We can sum up the instructions \nin an action called Pathfinder that every version of Hedge will follow: 1. If you’ve reached the artifact, radio to your parent whether \nyou got there by going left or right. 2. When you reach an intersection, \nmove off the conveyor and send new copies down the left \nand right paths. Have them each run Pathfinder. This is where recursion comes in, and this may happen many times before\nthe last instruction triggers, which is: 3. If you hear anything over the radio,\nyou should radio to your parent whether you got to your spot \nby going left or right, then repeat everything you just heard. Pathfinder is an example \nof what programmers call functions, subroutines, or procedures. No matter the terminology, \nthe idea is the same— it’s a set of instructions given a label \nso that it can be easily reused— perhaps even by itself. And in our case that’ll work perfectly— an entire network of paths mapped\nusing just three instructions. So here's what happens. By the time the patrol rounds the corner,\nEthic and Lemma have improvised disguises. They try to confuse the bots \nlong enough to buy Hedge time. Finally, Hedge’s radio crackles to life \nwith a series of directions. The three dive onto the conveyor\nand flee for their lives, with a squadron of enforcer bots \nin hot pursuit."}, "multiple-choice": []}

The suckers are incredibly strong. And while we only have two hands to grab things,\nan octopus holds on with hundreds of suckers running up and down each arm. Suckers come in pretty handy to get around. Or to grab a bite to eat. Or to hang onto your keeper’s arm. So how do suckers stick so well? It’s not super glue. It’s water pressure. Each sucker has a ring called an infundibulum. It creates a water-tight seal. Inside the sucker there’s a chamber, like\na cup, called the acetabulum. It’s full of water. When the octopus expands the chamber, it lowers\nthe pressure inside. The higher pressure outside pushes against\nthe sucker creating a powerful grip. Suckers get such a workout that their skin\nsloughs off every few weeks. See that ring-shaped piece of skin floating\nby? It used to be the bottom of a sucker. Suckers have another super-power. They actually can smell and taste. That helps the octopus tell there’s no snail\ninside this shell. Hundreds of suckers tasting and smelling,\nand flexible arms moving every which way, create a huge amount of information -- a lot\nfor the octopus’ central brain to process. So each arm has a mind of its own. In fact, two thirds of an octopus’ neurons\nare in its arms. That means the central brain isn’t really\ncalling all the shots. The central brain tells the arms how fast\nto move. But the instructions on how to reach come\nfrom each arm. It’s a nifty way to process all that information,\nmaking the octopus the well-choreographed creature we know. AMY: Hi. This is Amy Standen.

That's as many humans as in the next 20 most\npopulous countries combined, or in the whole other 170 countries in the world. Over the last 300 years, India and China each\nadded more than a billion people to their populations, way more than any other country,\nbut they have actually been growing at about the same rate as the rest of the world. They have a lot more people today because\nthey had a lot more people a few hundred years ago, when the world began its period of modern,\nand rapid, population growth. It's like comparing a big bank account and\na small one. If they both grow at about the same rate over\nmany years, the big one gains a lot more money, simply because it started with more. So the billion-dollar, er, billion-person\nquestion, is why did India and China have so many people when they started their rapid\ngrowth? We can’t know for sure, since so many variables\nfactor into long-term population dynamics, but the two most plausible explanations are\nfood and area. Having lots of fertile land and good access\nto fresh water makes it possible to grow lots of food, which in turn makes it possible to\nnourish a lot of people. Even today, the 10 most populated countries\nin the world all have a relatively large amount of farmland. And Asia - and in particular south and east\nAsia - has tons of farmland, lots of river valleys, and the ability to grow food year-round. Plus, domestication of plants and animals\nessentially started in Asia, giving populations an early leg - or wing - up. As such, Asia’s been the most densely populated\nregion of the world for a really long time. Area matters too; countries like Pakistan\nand Bangladesh may be filled with farms and densely-populated, but because they’re smaller\nin area than India and China, they simply cannot contain as many people. Of course, a few other things happened in\nIndia and China in the last few thousand years, and some of them helped the populations grow,\nand some of them shrank the populations, but through it all, the large and fertile lands\nof India and China were able to sustain lots of people, such that when the era of modern\npopulation growth came around, they had a head start. Or rather, a hundred-million-head start.

Mabel is an aphid, a small insect \nin the same order as cicadas, stink bugs, and bed bugs. All these bugs pierce their prey \nand suck out vital fluids. Aphids’ prey are plants. And what aphids are after \nis buried within the plant, flowing in tubes made from single cells \nstrung end-to-end. These are called sieve tubes and together \nthey form the plumbing system for a plant’s most valuable resource: sap. Sap is mostly water and sugar. Some species’ sap has as much sugar \nper liter as a can of soda. Photosynthesis is constantly \nproducing sugar. You can think of it as a chemical “pump” \nwhich generates incredibly high pressure— up to 9 times that of a car tire— \nin the sieve tubes. To feed, Mabel uses her stylet,\nwhich is a long, flexible needle. She slowly worms it into the tissue, \nbetween the plant’s cells, until she pierces \none of those sieve tubes. Because the sap \nis under so much pressure, Mabel doesn’t even have to suck it out \nof the plant. She just opens a valve in her head \nand lets the pressure push the sap through her digestive system. We’ll come back to what comes out \nof her butt, but for now, you should know that plants don’t want \nto be punctured and sipped. So they try to defend themselves. One defense is the sap itself. To see how that works, let’s \nhypothetically hook up some other insect’s digestive tract \nto a steady stream of sap. When that sap touches the insect’s cells, \nits high sugar content encourages the water in the cells \nto come out by osmosis… exactly like salt encourages water \nto come out of a slug. The more sap that passes through \nthe insect, the more water it loses. Eventually, it shrivels up and dies. Mabel’s gut, however, is packed \nwith an enzyme called sucrase, which takes two molecules of sucrose \nand converts them into one molecule of fructose and one of… \nthis three-unit sugar. Mabel burns the fructose for energy, \nleaving the three-unit-sugar behind. Now, how does that help her? The more molecules of sugar \nthat are dissolved in the sap, the more water it can suck out \nof Mabel’s cells. By reducing the number of molecules \nof sugar in the sap, Mabel reduces its ability to suck water \nout of her cells. Plant sap neutralized. Now that means Mabel can feed for days, \ngetting all the energy she needs to reproduce. Some aphid species \nhave an incredible life cycle. For example, the green peach aphid. During the fall, males and females mate, \nand the females lay eggs. But in the spring, when the eggs hatch, \nall the nymphs that emerge are female. When those females reach maturity, \nthey don’t lay eggs. Instead, they give birth to live young… \nthat are clones of themselves… and already pregnant… \nwith their own clones. So, these female aphids have \ntwo generations of baby aphid clones forming inside themselves \nat the same time. Scientists call this \ntelescopic development. That means that aphids can make \nmore of themselves fast— there can be 20 generations \nwithin a single season— and that means lots of aphid poop. Mabel can poop her entire body weight \nevery two hours, making her one of the most prolific \npoopers on the planet. Some aphid populations can produce \nhundreds of kilograms of poop per acre. Now, aphid poop is not like your poop. Chemically, it’s not all that different \nfrom sap; it’s a clear and colorless sweet, \nsyrupy liquid. You might already know it \nby a different name: honeydew. Other species love honeydew. Some species of ants love it so much \nthey sort of herd and defend entire aphid colonies. In return, the ants get a steady supply \nof sweet honeydew, which they can drink directly \nfrom the aphids’ butts. Bottom’s up! Humans love honeydew, too. Several Native American tribes \nused to harvest it from tall reeds and make it into cake. And some species of bee make honey \nfrom honeydew, which humans then harvest and eat. So plants make the sap, \nwhich is eaten and pooped out by aphids, regurgitated by bees, \nharvested by humans, and dolloped into a cup of Earl Grey tea."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The ___ sugar dissolved in a plant’s sap, the more water it encourages to come out of an insect’s digestive tract by osmosis.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "less"}, {"label": "B", "text": "more"}, {"label": "C", "text": "doesn’t matter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "it depends on the insect"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these type of bug are aphids not in the same order as?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "cicadas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "stink bugs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "mosquitos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "bed bugs"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Pressure in a plant’s sieve tubes can reach as high as ____ times that of a car tire.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "9"}, {"label": "D", "text": "25"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "An aphid’s stylet does which of the following:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "helps it write"}, {"label": "B", "text": "helps it eat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "helps it sleep"}, {"label": "D", "text": "helps it fly"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The enzyme sucrase (in aphids’ guts) converts two molecules of sucrose into:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "one molecule of fructose and one molecule of a 3-unit sugar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "four molecules of fructose"}, {"label": "C", "text": "one molecule of glucose and one molecule of a 3-unit sugar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "four molecules of glucose"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

The story goes like this: our solar system\nformed from the collapse of a large cloud of dust and gas. The dense blob of gas at\nthe center ignited to form the sun, which as a young, unstable star unleashed a fierce\nsolar wind. Over time this stream of charged particles pushed the remaining gas cloud farther\nand farther out, leaving only solid particles behind to clump together into rocks, planetesimals,\nand finally, the rocky planets of the inner solar system that we know today. And here's the problem: water, in the form\nof ice, couldn't have been one of the solid particles that stuck around, because the early\ninner solar system was far too hot for frozen water, and any water vapor would have been\nblasted away by the solar wind. So if Earth didn't start off with water, how\ndid we end up with such splendid oceans? We know H2O wasn't manufactured here over the\neons, because natural processes like combustion, breathing and photosynthesis create and destroy\nroughly equal amounts of water - and either way, the amounts in question are so miniscule\nthat they can't account for the abundance of water on the planet. Since Earth's water was neither part of the\noriginal package nor manufactured here, it must have flown in from far away, on meteoroids\nor comets or other bodies originating in the outer solar system where they were far enough\nfrom the Sun for frozen water to survive. Comets, being dirty iceballs, are a logical\ncandidate for the source of our water, but were ruled out when we discovered that they\nare far richer in heavy hydrogen (that's hydrogen with a neutron as well as a proton in its\nnucleus) than Earth water. For every million hydrogen atoms in Earth water, about 150 are\nheavy ones, while typical comet water has twice that many. These mismatched chemical\nsignatures suggest that Earth's water could not have arrived on comets. It turns out that the most likely source for\nEarth's water is a type of meteorite called a carbonaceous chondrite. \"Chondrite\" is just\nthe name given to the class of stony meteoroids that most commonly strike the Earth. But only\nthe carbonaceous chondrites contain water - as well as lots of carbon, if you couldn't\ntell from their name. They have water in them because they formed out beyond the sun's \"frost\nline\", and what's more, their water has levels of heavy hydrogen similar to that of earth\nwater, strongly suggesting that these earth-crashers are the source of our ice caps, clouds, rivers,\nand oceans.

that were in our house i like this no not those no not harry potter's broom no we'll get sued for that anyway oh here it is tada that was acting by the way i am abraham lincoln the reason i wrote this book is you know as i always say that the lesson in every one of these books is always on the back so it's i am abraham lincoln by my favorite author brad meltzer my favorite illustrator chris eliopoulos who is our amazing artist um on the back it says the lesson i will always speak my mind and speak for others and so um one of the things that you're going to see in this one is this is going to focus for you who are xavier riddle fans is dr zoom can you believe it edina has a stuffed doctor zoom i have a stuffed abraham lincoln that's right i do so we're gonna learn um and dr zoom is gonna play a major role in this book uh you scream yell when you see him uh or her i should say and this is i am abraham lincoln by brad meltzer and christopher elliopoulos here we go i am abraham lincoln always starts with b right gotta figure out where we are and what we're doing when i was little even young boys were expected to work on the farm and hunt animals for food and he preferred he says i prefer to read man after my own heart i also love daniel is my favorite story in the book when i was 10 years old i saw a group of boys playing with some turtles he's like they found turtles i love turtles abram like i loved animals but as i got closer i realized they weren't playing they were taking hot coals and putting them on top of the turtles to see what happened to them it was harmless fun look it's making the turtle run faster and they're teasing they're torturing these turtles in that moment i could have just walked away when you're 10 years old it's hard to do the right thing but someone has to he says let the turtle go he's like what'd you say he says you heard me let it go those boys let the turtle go soon after i wrote one of my first essays about how hurting animals is wrong that may not seem like a big deal but back then most kids and even adults didn't know how to write in fact the state of indiana was so new schools weren't even built yet i went to school for barely a year total but that didn't stop me using chalk i practiced writing the alphabet on trees i even wrote in the dirt of the cornfield when it came to learning my best teachers were simply books i loved books so much i once walked six miles i'm serious six miles to get one i'd read while my horse was resting and while waiting in line at the local store and in one of my favorite positions with my feet up on a tree i want you out there by the way if you're hearing this take pictures yourself reading with your feet up on a tree and send it to me before long i read every book in the neighborhood from the bible to aesop's fables to robinson caruso but one of my favorites this is who abraham lincoln's hero was his favorite book that george washington that's true washington wasn't one of his heroes i'd even copy my favorite parts on pieces of wood he said did you know that george washington was a friend of men you're a strange boy abraham lincoln she says yeah but i'm going to be on the penny someday what's a penny this is called a writing joke you're going to learn today it's good when i was 22 years old we moved to illinois where i met a group known as the clary's grove voice everyone in town knew they were bullies i didn't like bullies but i was the new guy when they challenged me i didn't have much choice today some will call it a fight but it was really a wrestling match me against their leader jack armstrong back then the rule was once you grabbed your opponent you couldn't break your hole don't let go wham he throws him look at that pout but jack did so he could grab my leg and send me flying i wasn't mad i lost everyone loses sometimes what got me upset he had cheated he didn't play fair he says maybe you want to fight us all within seconds they all surrounded me scary right they were waiting for me to back down or to lose my cool instead calmly and confidently i told him if i have to i will fight every single one of you fair and square they knew i meant it you're a strange kid abraham lincoln but you've got guts you know i'm gonna be on the penny one day what's a penny he says sometimes the hardest fights don't reveal a winner but they do reveal character especially when you're fighting for something you believe in still not every struggle brought a victory years later i saw a group of enslaved people chained together in a boat on the ohio river back then not all people were free some were enslaved just because of the color of their skin they were forced to work without pain they were treated terribly i'll never forget i love this drawing kristen i'll never forget the sight of that boat i didn't do anything that day but for those years the memory of those people i love this drawing it haunted me i was still thinking about them when i became president i lost four elections before i got the big job four america was facing one of the greatest fights in our history the civil war one side wanted to let the enslaved people go free the other side we want to keep slavery going and won't fight anyone who says otherwise if i had turned my head and looked away i would have avoided the fight but if i'd learned anything in life it was this when someone needed help i wasn't so good at looking away says i'm sorry i can't allow that would you just say you heard me these people will be free this is one of my favorite pages the civil war lasted longer than anyone thought the fighting took a terrible toll people on our side were ready to give up to re-energize them we held a big event in gettysburg pennsylvania the main speaker gave a speech that lasted nearly two hours i gave a speech that lasted two minutes and used only 271 words the most important five words i used all men are created equal soon after i helped pass a law that ended slavery in america and freed all these people then we ended the civil war as a result we didn't just bring together these united states of america we proved that this government of the people by the people and for the people will be dedicated to freedom and justice by the way did i ever tell you that i'm hidden in every book i'm not going to show you where at all i am not showing you where you know in his speech he told the crowd that no one would remember what he said at gettysburg but we did and here's the important part in life strength can take many forms but there's nothing quite as strong as standing up for someone who needs it no matter where you're from or how little you have one thing that can never be taken away from you is your

not to tell anyone who's coming that is coming soon on xavier riddle i never said it see pbs kids i never said it abraham lincoln's coming see i didn't even say that that wasn't me it was it was him that's who did it anyway my name is brad meltzer thank you for tuning in we still do not have a crayon utility belt like brad wears his crayon utility belt on xavier rail but again i promise you i will get a crayon utility belt it is coming i determined to find one um thank you for joining us and let me entertain your kids today in this these crazy times keep reading keep reading the most important keep being nice to each other [Music] hi everybody i'm chris eliopoulos i'm the co-creator of xavier riddle and the secret museum on pbs kids i'm also a cartoonist illustrator so what we're going to do is we're going to draw abraham lincoln [Music] in my life i discovered that many things need to be taken step by step so i want you to work with your kids and your fellow teachers and your parents on how to draw and it all starts with the letter c we're gonna do a letter c right here now the trick is when you're doing this you make sound effects like i do while i'm sitting at home in my cartoonish studio next up we're going to do the letter u a giant u shape press like that and then all we need is a straight little line so there's an eye a c and a u i can see you drawing through this camera next up we're gonna do a little line straight across for his hat we're gonna add that little line so abraham lincoln used to have like a stove pipe hat really tall hat so we're gonna do a couple little lines on either side next up two more simple line now for fun since the hat is really tall we're going to go right up off the page i want to see you guys draw those lines right up off the page now we're gonna start with numbers the number three will be the hair how does three become hair just like this and we've got hair and then we're gonna do another three on the other side for more hair next up i'm gonna give you a trivia question how did abraham lincoln smell if you said with his nose you're right his nose is a backwards c oink and then we're going to do two little dots for eyes [Music] give him some eyebrows [Music] a big old smile and then of course abraham lincoln when he was 11 did not have a beard but we're a cartoonist so we're going to draw him with a beard a bunch of u-shapes and there you have it abraham lincoln just for you try it at home share with your friends and families"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When Lincoln was little what did he love

{"page": 14, "lesson": 24, "title": "Embrace the Shake - Phil Hansen", "category": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/embrace-the-shake-phil-hansen", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Joseph Geni\nReviewer: Morton Bast So, when I was in art school, I developed a shake in my hand, and this was the straightest line I could draw. Now in hindsight, it was actually good for some things, like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid, but at the time this was really doomsday. This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. The shake developed out of, really, a single-minded pursuit of pointillism, just years of making tiny, tiny dots. And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles, because of the shake. So to compensate, I'd hold the pen tighter, and this progressively made the shake worse, so I'd hold the pen tighter still. And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues, I had trouble holding anything. And after spending all my life wanting to do art, I left art school, and then I left art completely. But after a few years, I just couldn't stay away from art, and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. And he actually took one look at my squiggly line, and said, \"Well, why don't you just embrace the shake?\" So I did. I went home, I grabbed a pencil, and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. I was making all these scribble pictures. And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about, it felt great. And more importantly, once I embraced the shake, I realized I could still make art. I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. Now, I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism, seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work, like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas, or, in a 3D structure consisting of two-by-fours, creating a 2D image by burning it with a blowtorch. I discovered that, if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials, my hand really wouldn't hurt, and after having gone from a single approach to art, I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. At the time, I was finishing up school, and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. I had this horrible little set of tools, and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have. I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at. So I got out of school, I got a job, I got a paycheck, I got myself to the art store, and I just went nuts buying supplies. And then when I got home, I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. But I sat there for hours, and nothing came to mind. The same thing the next day, and then the next, quickly slipping into a creative slump. And I was in a dark place for a long time, unable to create. And it didn't make any sense, because I was finally able to support my art, and yet I was creatively blank. But as I searched around in the darkness, I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before. And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands. Embrace the shake. And I realized, if I ever wanted my creativity back, I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it. I wondered, could you become more creative, then, by looking for limitations? What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies? At this point, I was spending a lot of my evenings in -- well, I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks — but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one, so I decided to ask for 50. Surprisingly, they just handed them right over, and then with some pencils I already had, I made this project for only 80 cents. It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless. I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas, and wondered what if, instead of painting on a canvas, I could only paint on my chest? So I painted 30 images, one layer at a time, one on top of another, with each picture representing an influence in my life. Or what if, instead of painting with a brush, I could only paint with karate chops? (Laughter) So I'd dip my hands in paint, and I just attacked the canvas, and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. (Laughter) (Applause) Or, what if instead of relying on myself, I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art? So for six days, I lived in front of a webcam. I slept on the floor and I ate takeout, and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life-changing moment. Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. (Applause) Or what if instead of making art to display, I had to destroy it? This seemed like the ultimate limitation, being an artist without art. This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art, where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. In the beginning of Goodbye Art, I focused on forced destruction, like this image of Jimi Hendrix, made with over 7,000 matches. (Laughter) Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. I looked for temporary materials, like spitting out food -- (Laughter) — sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine. The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place. So I organized candles on a table, I lit them, and then blew them out, then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles, then assembled the videos into the larger image. So the end image was never visible as a physical whole. It was destroyed before it ever existed. In the course of this Goodbye Art series, I created 23 different pieces with nothing left to physically display. What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation, as each time I created, the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project. It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground, or, even worse, after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process, I continued on, and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project, I was learning to let go, let go of outcomes, let go of failures, and let go of imperfections. And in return, I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results. I found myself in a state of constant creation, thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. When I think back to my three years away from art, away from my dream, just going through the motions, instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream, I just quit, I gave up. And what if I didn't embrace the shake? Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life, and having life skills. Because ultimately, most of what we do takes place here, inside the box, with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and, collectively, transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now, when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped, I sometimes still struggle, but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities, like using hundreds of real, live worms to make an image, using a pushpin to tattoo a banana, or painting a picture with hamburger grease. (Laughter) One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity, but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts, rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day, maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you.
