Adapt. Blend in. Turns out that is all wrong. Chameleons don’t change color to match their\nenvironment. In fact, it’s just the opposite. Their baseline is camouflage. When chameleons are relaxed, they’re mostly\ngreen. They naturally blend into their home in the\nforest canopy. They even mimic leaves by dancing around a\nlittle. But when they feel threatened, or annoyed,\nor just want to show a little swagger – that is when their color changes. They transform into living mood rings. Chameleons change color to make a statement. The faster their skin changes colors, the\nmore excited they are. How do they do this? Well it turns out we’ve been getting that\nwrong too. Until this year, scientists thought chameleons\nchange color by spreading out pigments in their cells, like the skin of the squid we’re\nseeing right here. But the truth is way more complex. Just below the surface of their skin is a\nlayer of cells called iridophores. These cells contain tiny, nano-scale salt\ncrystals. They’re only a 130 nanometers across – that’s\nless than one hundredth of the width of a human hair. The crystals are arranged in a three-dimensional\nlattice. When light hits the lattice, it shatters into\ndifferent wavelengths. Some are absorbed and some bounce back. The result, to our eyes, appears green or\nred or blue. The wings of the Morpho butterfly have similar\nstructures, which reflect brilliant blue hues. But unlike Morpho butterflies, chameleons\ncan stretch or contract the lattice, which moves the distance between crystals. Each of these points of light is an array\nof crystals. When the distance changes, the crystals reflect\na different wavelength of light. The result is a dramatic shift in color. So what if we could come up with some kind\nof material that could change from one brilliant color to another? Electrical engineers at UC Berkeley are trying\nto do that. To mimic a chameleon’s structural color\ncontrol with synthetic materials. They arranged tiny, nano-scale silicon ribbons\non a sheet of flexible plastic. Each one of these “pixels” is made up\nof about 160 ribbons. When the plastic stretches, the space between\nthe ribbons becomes greater and a different wavelength of light is reflected – just\nlike chameleon skin. Well, almost. This synthetic chameleon skin has just one\nlayer of nano-scale arrays. The salt crystals in real chameleon skin are\nstacked in several layers, which makes their skin some of the most colorful and complex\nin the animal kingdom. They produce colors that aren’t even visible\nto human eyes. What I like about chameleons is they show\nus how wrong we can be about science. What we called “camouflage” is an entire\nlanguage… as alien to us as the clicks of a dolphin or the low rumble of an elephant.

This deficit of days,\nthis calendar craziness, this oddity of the annum, like so much of modern culture, is\nthe Romans’ fault. Here’s the crazy story of why February has 28 days… except when\nit doesn’t. [MUSIC] Romulus, the maybe-mythical, maybe-real founder\nand first king of Rome, had a problem. With an increasing number of festivals, feasts,\nmilitary ceremonies, and religious celebrations to keep track of, Romans needed a calendar\nto organize all of them. Ancient astronomers already had accurate calculations\nfor the time between two solar equinoxes or solstices, but nature had given people a nice,\neasy pie chart in the sky to track the passage of time, so early Rome, like many other cultures,\nworked off a lunar calendar. The calendar of the Romulan republic had ten\nmonths of either 30 or 31 days, beginning in March and ending in December, and we can\nstill see traces of that calendar today. Problem was, that year was a few days short\nof four seasons. Romans were too busy not dying during winter to count those 61 and\na quarter extra days… they’d just start the next year on the new moon before the spring\nequinox. It’s actually not a bad system, as long\nas you don’t have to figure out what day it is between December and March. So the second king of Rome, Numa Pompilius,\ntried something else. Even numbers were bad luck in Ancient Rome,\nso Numa started by removing a day from all the even-numbered months. And being loony for Luna, Numa wanted his\ncalendar to cover 12 cycles of the moon, but that would have been an even number, so he\nrounded his year up to 355. Numa split the remaining days into two months and tacked\nthem on to the end of the year. And that’s how February got 28 days. Yes,\nit’s an even number, but since the month was dedicated to spiritual purification, Romans\nlet that one slide. But, as powerful as Rome may have been, they\ncouldn’t change the rules of the universe, and neither of these calendars add up anywhere\nclose to the time it takes us to orbit the sun. After a few years, the seasons are out\nof whack with the months, dogs and cats, living together, mass hysteria!! Did we already use that joke? This is where it gets even weirder. See, February was actually split in two parts.\nThe first 23 days and… the rest. Every year, Numa’s superstitious calendar\nwould be out of line with the seasons by a little more than 10 days. So every other year,\nthe last few days of February were ignored and a 27-day leap month was added after February\n23rd or 24th. This way every four years would average out\nto 366 and a quarter days… which is still too many days, but hey, we’re getting there. Confused? You should be. Numa! This system could have worked, every 19 years,\nlunar and solar calendars tend to line up, so add enough leap months to keep the seasons\nin order and eventually everything will reset itself. Except these leap months weren’t always\nadded according to plan. Politicians would ask for leap months to extend their terms,\nor “forget” them to get their opponents out of office. And if Rome was at war, sometimes the leap\nmonth would be forgotten for years, and by the time Julius Caesar came to power, things\nhad gotten pretty confusing. Caesar had spent a lot of time in Egypt, where\n365-day calendars were all the rage, so in 46 BC, he flushed Rome’s lunar calendar\ndown the aqueduct and installed a solar calendar. January and February had already been moved\nto the beginning of the year, and Caesar added 10 days to different months to get a total\nof 365. And since a tropical year is a tad longer\nthan 365 days, Julius added a leap day every four years, except they inserted it after\nFebruary 23, right in the middle of the month. Apparently February is the trash heap of the\ncalendar, just do whatever feels good. For all their work to reform the calendar\nand other stuff they did, the 7th and 8th months of the year were renamed for Julius\nand his successor Augustus Caesar, despite the fact that Pope Gregory would have to adjust\nit again in 1500 years. But that’s a \nstory for a different day. Or month. I don’t even know anymore. Stay curious."}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 5, "lesson": 3, "title": "How did the deepest part of the ocean get so polluted?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/hb2oNNgR", "transcript": {"en": "For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers\nthat lurk deep below the ocean’s surface. Maybe there’s a horrifying colossal squid,\nor a Kraken, or an evil villain’s lair. As it turns out, the reality is far worse. Hey there polluting population, Jules here\nfor DNews! The Mariana Trench is the deepest known part\nof the ocean, stretching down roughly 36,000 feet. You’d imagine that at those depths, the\nocean floor is pristine, almost untouched by human activity. Well, I’ve got some bad news for ya. Turns out, the bottom of the ocean is very,\nvery polluted. And that’s not some click-bait hyperbole;\nit is more polluted than some of the most polluted regions on the surface of the globe. One probe into the Marianas Trench only had\nto go about 16,000 feet down to find physical remnants of actual garbage, not just waste\nbyproducts. Beer cans, plastic bags, even an entire, unopened\ncan of SPAM was found resting along the Trench’s wall. And unless it is removed, this trash can stay\ndown there indefinitely, just piling up. Plastics, for example, are made up of super-strong\ncarbon to carbon bonds. These bonds are not prone to being broken\ndown by organic organisms; the material hasn’t existed in nature long enough for there to\nhave evolved much to break it down. In 2016 scientists found one type of microbe\nthat can do it, but only for a specific type of plastic. And even if we could solve this physical trash\nproblem, there lies an even deeper problem. Literally. In late 2016, a paper published in the journal\nNature, examined the inhabitants of two of the deepest oceanic trenches in the world. Small little crustaceans called amphipods\nare the perfect study specimen, as they have fatty tissue, which stores not just fat but\nalso any chemicals that are ingested. And despite these amphipods being located\nin two different parts of the world, thousands of feet below the surface, they were ALL contaminated\nby what are called “persistent organic pollutants” or POPs. “Persistent” meaning that they don’t\nbreak down in their environment, and are almost impossible to remove. These include chemicals that have been banned\nfrom use for decades, at least in the United States, like polychlorinated biphenyls, which\nhave been shown to be birth defect and cancer-causing. Other chemicals like pesticides were present\nas well. The concentration of POPs was SO high that\nit was 50 times greater than in one of China’s most polluted rivers, and was roughly equal\nto that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial waste dumping ground. So, how did this pollution make it all the\nway down there? Well the researchers suggest that, in the\ncase of the Mariana Trench, it may have to do with a little something called the Great\nPacific Garbage Patch. While there are many areas where trash congregates\nin the ocean, the paper refers to a huge floating clump of garbage in the Northwest Pacific\nocean that floats just near the Mariana’s Trench, and so plastics and other chemicals\nend up sinking to its depths. There’s another theory that the pollution\nfound down there is the result of POP chemicals entering the food chain. The amphipods that live in these deep waters\nare scavengers. When a larger animal, like a dolphin or a\nwhale, dies, it slowly sinks to the bottom of the ocean floor, a phenomenon known as\ncarrion-falls. If this carrion lived in polluted waters,\nthen it could have pollution in its system, and that pollution would persist in animals\nthat eat it. The paper does say that this is unlikely,\nhowever, given that there is consistent contamination at different depths. But either of these theories for how the POPs\ngot so deep would be a huge problem for us humans. If these chemicals are so persistent within\nthe food chain, then they eventually reach our own food supply, contaminating it with\nour own contaminants. But it isn’t just bad for us, it’s bad\nfor every living thing. Ocean pollution saps the amount of oxygen\nin the water, which can lead to mass death of marine life. Certain chemicals can even create reproductive\nissues for animals in the ocean, so even if they do survive, they can’t do much for\ntheir species. Society has spent the last few centuries dumping\ntons of trash into the ocean, including industrial waste, radioactive waste, munitions, and sewage. The EPA says, quote, “Wastes were frequently\ndumped in coastal and ocean waters based on the assumption that marine waters had an unlimited\ncapacity to mix and disperse wastes.” But now we’re learning that this isn’t\nreally the case. The out of sight out, of mind is killing ocean\ncreatures and endangering our own health. It turns out nowhere is safe from pollution. Not even the deepest part of the ocean.

Only when seen it in its ideal habitat, can\nwe truly appreciate this king among birds. Behold: the nobel pigeon.” If you think they’re only good for pooping\non statues, then think again. [OPENING MUSIC] In On the Origin of Species, Charles Darwin\npresented an idea that changed the world. He knew if he was right, this idea was gonna\nturn science on its head, so in chapter 1, you know what he chose as his very first\nexample? It wasn’t the tortoises, or finches, or\neven the giant fossil armadillos he found during his journeys. He chose pigeons. Over giant fossil armadillos. But he had a good reason, and if you think\notherwise, then you’ve never seen FANCY pigeons. These are the birds that got Darwin’s attention,\nbecause underneath all that feathery fashion, is just one species, like dogs with wings\ninstead of rats with wings. All of that variation was tweaked from one\nancient mold. The wild rock dove. Thousands of years before they were eating\nold hot dog buns out of the trash, these birds were found on seaside cliffs, but pretty much\nas soon as cities sprung up, they moved in, because to a pigeon, a building is just\na cliff with better architecture. Pigeons are uniquely suited to city life,\nbut they were only able to conquer all of Earth’s urban areas because we brought them\nthere. Why? Because we liked feeding them… to ourselves. In fact, from Egypt to Rome to the early 20th\ncentury, the main roles of a pigeon were dinner, or something for rich people to breed into\nsilly shapes. Over time here and there, a few of these domestic\nbirds escaped and returned to a “wild” life, they just never left the city. But for some reason along that journey, our opinion\nof pigeons went from this… to this. Watch pigeons pecking at the sidewalk and\nyou’re not looking at the smartest birds in the tree. They can’t solve puzzles like crows. They can’t talk like parrots. A pigeon’s brain is only about the size\nof that fingertip… but like most things in nature there’s more to the story. Most of their skull is eyeball: if they were\nthe size of humans, their eyes would be as big as grapefruits… Those huge eyes have five color receptors,\ncompared to our three, letting them see things we can’t imagine. One pigeon named Linus was trained to remember\nnearly a thousand images. Pigeons can peck out a Monet from a Picasso,\nthey can even judge if a child’s drawing is good or bad. Pigeons can tell correctly spelled words among\nmisspelled words, As if they aren’t annoying enough.. They can even put groups of objects in numerical\norder, which sounds easy because we’re smart, but pigeons do numbers as well as monkeys\ndo, Pigeon vision is the bomb. Literally. During WW II, psychologist B.F. Skinner tried\nto turn these birds into weapons. He trained pigeons to keep an image centered\non a tiny screen by pecking at it. He hooked this up to a navigation system,\nand then loaded it inside of a bomb. He wanted to create explosive missiles piloted\nby kamikaze pigeons. He built several successful prototypes using\nmoney from the General Mills cereal company… yes, the people who make Cheerios, but the\nArmy never let it get off the ground. Pigeon navigation goes a lot farther than\nbird bombs. Just like /human/ city-dwellers, pigeons are\ncommuters, flying out in the morning to find food and coming back at night. They’re tightly bonded to their home, and\nthis instinct is so strong that we’ve used them as messengers for centuries, like Flapchat\ninstead of Snapchat. Before Paul Reuter founded a global news service,\nhe used pigeons to deliver news. During World War I and II, racing pigeons\nwith names like Cher Ami and GI Joe were given actual medals for delivering messages under\nfire. How are pigeons so good at finding their way\nhome from places they’ve never been? Different experiments have found pigeons use\nvisual maps, Earth’s magnetic field, the angle of the sun, even smells to navigate. But when scientists knock each of these senses\nout, some birds can still find their way home. What we do know is pigeons use a lot of senses,\nmaybe even some we don’t know about yet. Even though pigeons are everywhere, there’s\none thing you never seem to see: Baby pigeons. They do exist, and… they are ugly. But it’s a reminder that even a bird that’s\neverywhere only gives us glimpses into its life. Darwin’s ideas about natural selection were\nborn on a voyage around the world. But you don’t have to go to exotic places\nto have your mind blown by evolution’s awesomeness. Darwin knew that, and that’s why he picked\nthe pigeon to introduce the world to his theory. If you know where to look, wildlife is everywhere that\nwe are: just make sure if you look up to admire it, you keep your mouth closed. Stay curious. I want to thank our friends from BBC Earth\nfor helping us make this episode, because pigeons look awesome in slow-motion. Some of pigeons’ oldest enemies have followed\nthem to cities: birds of prey. These scientists are studying peregrine falcons\nfor Planet Earth II, the sequel to the groundbreaking BBC series. It’s part of “Cities”, an entire episode\ndedicated to urban wildlife. Of course, birds of prey aren’t pigeons’\nonly urban predators.

They have a pretty effective way to catch\nthat fish. First they take aim…bank left... Then dive downward at 40 miles an hour. Bulls-eye! But one mistake, and they could wind up with\na broken wing, a snapped neck, even blind. So how does this massive bird survive a 40-foot\ndrop onto rock-hard water? A big part of it is just good form. See how the wings shoot back right before\nimpact? That safeguards the delicate bones there. At the same instant, powerful muscles tense\naround the spine, keeping the bird from snapping its neck. While sheaths called nictitating membranes slide over the eyes like a pair of swim goggles. But most of the credit goes to that magnificent,\nsword-shaped bill. It’s contoured to slice into the surface\nat high speed with almost no drag. Pelicans are surface hunters, not divers. When they hit the water, they also hit the\nbrakes, reaching with their necks to snag fish. They slow down thanks to a built-in life vest,\na special network of extra air sacs under the skin around their neck and belly, even\nin their bones. When it plummets, the pelican takes a deep\nbreath and air rushes into those tiny caverns, called pneumatic foramina. That air cushions the impact and makes them\nfloat. And this bird comes equipped with another\nflotation device. Meet the gular pouch. See how it pops open, like a parachute? That also helps slow the bird down. It’s made of super-stretchy skin, re-enforced\nwith collagen fibers that keep it from breaking. Pretty handy fishing net, too, thanks to extra-flexible\njaw that can open sideways….not just up and down. A pelican’s pouch holds much more than its\nbelly can, about three gallons of water, which has to be squeezed out before the big gulp. The whole routine takes practice. These young ones have got some room for improvement. But pelicans have been making it work for\nan incredibly long time. This fossil is 30 million years old, and it's\nalmost identical to the aerodynamic high-divers that you see living today. This pelican looks more red than brown, right? That’s a sign that it’s breeding season,\nwhich for California pelicans, is in the winter. That’s when they get gussied up and head\nsouth to Baja. Don’t miss a single Deep Look!

So what’s up with the wrinkled digits? For years, scientists thought the phenomenon\nwas the result of a type of osmosis, caused by water passing into the dry outer layer\nof skin. The influx of water, the thinking went, would\nexpand the skin’s surface area, but not the tissue below it, so the skin would bunch\nup and wrinkle. But in 1935, a pair of doctors noticed that\nthis effect didn’t happen in their patients with nerve damage. One patient, for example, was a boy who had\nlost the feeling in three of his fingers. The researchers found that, when his hand\ngot wet, the fingers that he could feel wrinkled as normal, but the ones that were numb remained\nsmooth. It turned out that pruney digits weren’t\ncaused just by the passive flow of water through the skin -- it was an active response of the\nnervous system to prolonged moisture. The nervous system causes the wrinkling by\nconstricting blood vessels below the skin, which causes the upper layers of skin to pucker. Since the phenomenon is caused by an involuntary\nnerve response, some biologists have thought that it must have some evolutionary function. But what possible purpose could it serve? One recent theory suggests that wrinkly skin\nmay have given our ancestors a better grip while working in wet conditions -- like gathering\nfood from a stream or damp vegetation. And it may also have given us better footing\nwhile walking across slippery landscapes in the rain. In a 2013 study, evolutionary biologists tested\nthis theory by asking subjects with either wrinkly and non-wrinkly fingers to pick up\na variety of wet and dry objects, like marbles. They found that the subjects with wrinkly\ndigits picked up the wet objects 12 percent faster than their counterparts. But there was no difference when it came to\npicking up dry objects. The wrinkles apparently helped channel the\nwater away, much like the treads on your car’s tires. But then this raises the question: If wrinkly\nskin gives us a better grip, then why isn’t our skin wrinkly ALL of the time? Well, maybe because shriveled fingers and\ntoes are less sensitive, which is no advantage at all. Thanks for asking!

{"page": 5, "lesson": 8, "title": "The history of manners", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/47qL79mj", "transcript": {"en": "It seems natural to most of us that we\nshouldn't burp loudly in front of strangers, touch their behinds without\npermission or spit in the face of those who annoy us but history shows us a\ndifferent story. What we might take to be normal impulses\nto be modest, restrained and dignified are the hard-won fruits of a long and always\nunsteady civilizing process. Human beings have gradually and\npainfully learned to tame the beast inside for the sake of propriety and\nkindness. At a moment in time when some people question manners and the pressures they impose on us, it can be fruitful to look back in time\nin order to trace key moments in the history of manners and to search their\nby for the future of manners. 13,000 BC, Gough's Cave, Somerset, England W're in a cave in what's known as The Magdalenian period, one of the later cultures of the Upper\nPaleolithic Age in Western Europe. Our ancestors have learned to use harpoons made of bone antlers. They've domesticated dogs and in their\nspare time have developed a taste for making remarkable images of the fiercest\nwildlife around them especially hyena reindeer and mammoths. We look a little different from the way we do now: our bodies are generally heavier and\nmore solid with strong musculature and straight foreheads with only slight brow\nridges and prominent chins. Our manners would surprise us to: we sleep around a lot and openly. There is a lot of what we now call\nrape. We do everything in front of one another in our caves and most strikingly\nwe have an occasional habit of eating our human enemies. Following a squabble the leader of a\ngroup will take an enemy severed head carefully remove the brains and tissues\nand prepare the skull for use as a ceremonial drinking vessel. Primitive humans don't do manners. Circus Maximus, Rome, 20 AD We are at one of the high points\nof ancient civilization in the West. In many areas of daily life we won't have this many manners and complex etiquette for another 1400 years\nat least. We're taking fascinating care to tame nature within us. For the wealthy ones among us at least we've taken to having at least a bath a week, to removing nasal hair, ? tailing displays of violence, to policing the way men behave towards women, to carving chicken and fish and brushing our teeth a lot, conscious of our bad breath and its effect on the\nsensitivities of others. However, with little knowledge of odontology Romans use a variety of somewhat random ingredients for toothpaste: crushed bone and oyster shell is popular, horse urine is another favorite especially from Iberian breeds. The specifics of the Roman approach to oral hygiene may be questionable but the mentality is advanced and fascinating. Good personal appearance and cleanliness are believed to be what set Romans apart in their minds from what they term the\nBarbaria: the people who live north of the famous olive line, the line above which the noble olive tree will not grow, the Germanics and Celts among them. Humanity will have to wait a while until\nCharlemagne is next recorded as brushing his teeth with thyme. Poitiers, France, 1152 French Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine marries Henry II of England at her court in the South of France. She employs a poet, the troubadour Bernart de Ventadorn to compose songs of love for her and her husband. This sounds merely romantic but the\nsongs are not simple sentimentality. They are part of Eleanor's subtle\nattempt to civilize her husband and the men around him by putting into verse how a good man should treat his lady. She and her ladies-in-waiting learn to use poetry to set expectations of how military men should act around women. Slowly thanks in part to Eleanor and\nattitude known as chivalry develops in the courts of Europe: an idea that men\nneed to moderate their force and sexual impulses to protect what is termed the\nhonor and dignity of women. Eleanor of Aquitaine is making an early\nhighly coded call from ?? to what we would nowadays more bluntly term sexual harassment. London, England, 1209 The Book of the Civilized Man is published by Daniel of Beccles. It's a poem written in Latin that explains how to act with courtesy\nand decorum in social situations. It advises for example if you wish to\nbelch remember to look up to the ceiling, do not attack your enemy while he is\nsquatting to defecate, never pest a lady or look too closely at their dress. Don't mount your horse in the hole and\nin front of grandees do not openly excavate your nostril by twisting your\nfingers. Slowly the aristocracy is becoming more self-aware about its conduct in social circumstances. In particular, men are being asked to behave with more decorum around women and as an ever-increasing sensor of picking one's\nnose in public. Murano, Venice 1450 A new kind of tableware, the Venetian glass goblet or flute takes Europe by storm, under the direction of the Venetian\nmaster glass-maker Angelo Barovier. On the island of Murano, some 3,000 glass blowers are sating demand for a new highly delicate and ornamented kind of glass. Part of the reason for the demand is that the glasses are extremely easy to break. Any slightly rough handling of them and they shatter like a dry autumn leaf. The Venetian drinking glass is not fragile because of a deficiency or by mistake; it's not as if its maker was trying to\nmake it tough and hardy and then stupidly ended up with something a child could snap. It is fragile and easily harmed as the consequence of a deliberate search for extreme delicacy. The underlying thesis is that it's the\nduty of civilization to create environments where it's okay to be fragile. It's obvious the glass could easily be\nsmashed so it forces people especially men to use their fingers very tenderly. It teaches people that moderation is\nadmirable and elegant not just a tedious demand. It tells us that being careful is\nglamorous and exciting even fashionable. It's a moral tale about gentleness told\nby means of a drinking vessel. The Venetian glass makes a big claim: being mannered and civilized involves being aware of the effect of one's strength on others. Marseille, France, 1533 14-year-old Catherine de' Medici marries the future Henry II of France. Her home city of Florence is by now the epicenter of culture in the Western world. And she brings with her new culinary fashions that quickly become all the rage:\nmacaroons, gelato and most significantly a collection of forks. The fork adds a bizarre complication to\nthe rituals of eating dinner: instead of using our fingers which are ideally made for tearing meat off the bone fast, we'll slow down on purpose and may use the strange new instrument so as to temper and guide our appetite. The fork quickly spreads around Europe, by 1600 no European court is without a large set of forks. This marks out the savages from the\ncivilized. Marais, Paris, 1750 A Swiss philosopher, Jean-Jacques Rousseau publishes an extraordinary essay: \"A Discourse on the Arts and Sciences\". What makes it so revolutionary and such a milestone in the history of manners is that for the first time in Western\nculture an author sticks up for the so called \"un-mannered savage\". For the guys who would have ? not brush their teeth, never employed a fork and had a lot of nasal hair, but whom Russo now contrast favorably with modern mannered\npeople. Rousseau tells us that people living in\nwhat he calls the state of nature were in his eyes far superior to educated and mannered Parisians. Their manners may have been simple but they were honest and\nforthright without the sins of what he now terms the \"over-civilized\". Russa retells the story of civilization as one of loss and decline, from a primordial state of fresh-faced curiosity, honesty and enthusiasm to barbarous over\npoliteness, fakery and deceit. He describes the elaborate French\ncourt Versay as less civilized than an early human cave. Readers across Europe are astonished and not a little impressed by this impudence. For hundreds of years moralists have been arguing that our natural selves are wild, harmful, over-sexual and dangerous and that we must\nlearn to a tame them for the sake of others. Now Russo suggest the diametrical\nopposite: civilization has gone too far, it's our mannered selves that have become the problem, and the task of a properly evolved civilization is to throw off the\nchains of manners, to relax us, strip off the etiquette and return to primitive\nfrankness. Russo's point continues to echo down to our own times. It is his voice we\ncan here whenever someone sticks up for the simpler life and suggest we dress\nless formally, eat dinner more casually and more readily say whatever is passing through our minds. New York, United States, 1827 A French aristocrat Alexis de Tocqueville is on a tour of the young United States, in an effort to understand the spirit of a new kind of society: A democracy. He is immediately struck by American\nmanners or lack thereof. In Europe, reflects de Tocqueville manners have been codified to emphasize hierarchical differences between people. Ordinary people defer to aristocrats, aristocrats to royalty and so on but in\nthe United States everything is done so as to suggest that there are no differences between people. No one takes off their hat to anyone, a\npostman can casually greet a judge, a mule driver can strike up cheerful banter\nwith a wealthy merchant, and one can not tell by someone's clothes whether they\nmight be living in a mansion or a hut. Expressions like \"how you doing\" and \"hi\" are heard everywhere across the new republic. It could be charming but the\naristocratic de Tocqueville wryly notes a problem: these casual\nmanners do not do away with class and wealth\ndifferences, they merely sentimentally disguise them. The manners of old Europe\nhave been accused of being cruel in their stress on hierarchy but now\nde Tocqueville  accuses American casual democratic manners of their own kind of cruelty: because they pretend that everyone is in the same boat when clearly they're not really. At least in old Europe everyone knew who the king and the aristocrats were, adds de Tocqueville. Now the casual manners teach everyone to think of themselves as alike and encourage them to dream of making it to the top of the pile. But when society remains very unequal\nand opportunities for genuine advancement and not as widespread as is\nthought then bitterness and a sense of failure are likely to be the result to\nde Tocqueville ? notes. Casual manners can be their own form of\nfakery. Northern Ireland, June 2013 At a meeting of the G8\ndeveloped countries a few eyebrows are raised when some of the most powerful\nmen in the world including Barrack Obama of the United States David Cameron of the United Kingdom and François Hollande of France all appear at a press conference without ties. The men also hug and in some cases high-five each other during the course\nof the summit. The absence of ties is an inadvertent and continuing tribute to Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Ties have been deemed a symbol of oppression and hierarchy by the people who control the nuclear codes and direct the world economy. Between 1996 and 2008 sales of ties in the U.S halved. In the UK, the Tirerack company, for 20 years the country's biggest seller of ties goes into administration in late 2014. By early 2015 in The United States only 18 percent of male employees regularly wear a tie to work. One-third show up in jeans at least once a week. Southwark Crown Court, London, September 2014 Eleanor of Aquitaine's long campaign to civilized men reaches a new milestone: A minor British DJ Dave Lee Travis is\nfound guilty of indecently assaulting a woman two decades earlier. He is accused by a judge of having\ndisplayed primitive behavior when he groped a young female employees breasts at his radio offices. Patting bottoms, eyeing breasts and throwing out leary comments is now deemed deeply anachronistic and vile manners. Dave Lee Travis, a 69 year old father of two is roundly punished and humiliated for his actions. Travis is in a long line of men who in\nthe early 21st century are called to account for their behavior towards women. They are puzzled and at a certain level\nincensed by this. They had come of age in a period when Victorian manners towards women were on the retreat seen as outdated and\nhypocritical. These men had believed in messages about casualness and sexual\nliberation but it seems they had fatally misinterpreted what a world with a few\nless sexual manners would actually be like. Slowly society is learning to re-heed some of the basic lessons of Victorian etiquette books always stressed: That men must be\ncareful around women, that they must never touch or look at them\ninappropriately and that the overwhelming priority is never to cause\nanyone else discomfort through one's advances. Men like Dave Lee Travis are\njudged to be pathological and sexual predators. Looked at through a longer lens\nthey could also simply be accused of having forgotten their manners. The history of manners shows an ongoing\nsearch for the best way to be kind. For long periods, it seemed that being mannered had to be about hiding and moderating the inner self which was associated with something beastly and cruel. Then under the\ninfluence of Rousseau and the Romantic philosophy to which he gave birth good manners were associated with being\nnatural and free, letting out the inner self which was deemed to be good and\nspontaneously kind. But we have come to learn that there are in fact limitations\nto the natural approach. There is unwitting cruelty and political\nsubterfuge in the defense of natural manners which suggests we're all equal\nwhen we're not which allow one gender to pester another. there's a fine line between being natural about things and being bothersome to others. Aline we are continuing to explore often at great cost to all concerned. There are no doubt many behaviors which many of us\nsubscribe to now which a later age may come to see is no less vulgar than\nCatherine de Medici found a meal without a fork. The aspiration to be well-mannered\nshouldn't be seen as pretentious or fake. It should be generously\ninterpreted as always belonging to a highly important wish not to cause other\npeople distress through one's impulses and needs.

Wash your hands, doo doo, doo doo, doo doo. Wash your hands! But … why? It’s because soap — regular soap, fancy\nhoneysuckle soap, artisan peppermint soap, just any soap — absolutely annihilates viruses\nlike the coronavirus. Here’s how. This is what a virus, like coronavirus, looks\nlike. It’s a bit of material surrounded by a coating\nof proteins — and fat. Viruses easily stick to places like your hands,\nbut when you rinse your hands with just water, it rushes right over the virus. That’s because that layer of fat makes the\nvirus behave kind of like a drop of oil. You can see it happening in this demonstration. Oils are just liquid fats. What happens when you pour oil into water? It floats — it doesn’t mix. But add soap… And suddenly that fatty oil dissolves into\nthe water. That’s because inside, soap has two-sided\nmolecules. One end of the molecule is attracted to water,\nthe other end to fat. So when the soap molecules come in contact\nwith water and fat, these dual attractions literally pull the fat apart, surrounding\nthe oil particles and dispersing them through the water.   Let’s go back to our coronavirus molecule. With that layer of fat holding everything\ntogether. When it interacts with soap … bam! The fat gets pulled out by the soap. Soap literally pulls apart and demolishes\nthese viruses. And then the water rinses the harmless, leftover\nshards of virus down the drain. But, and you know where I'm going with this, it takes time for this effect to happen. 20 seconds, to be specific. To show why, we ordered this lotion that mimics\nviruses and their fatty layers. It glows under a UV light. If you just rinse your hands under regular\nwater … nothing comes off. If you wash for just 5 seconds or 10 seconds,\nyour hands are still covered. The virus is still here, able to get you and\nothers sick. But 20 full seconds: Now the soap is actually\ndestroying the virus. Hand sanitizer works too, because it’s mostly\nalcohol, and alcohol works in a somewhat similar way to soap, breaking down that fatty layer. You need a high concentration of alcohol to\nmake that work. The CDC recommends hand sanitizers with at\nleast 60% alcohol. But even with 60% alcohol, the CDC recommends\nusing soap if you can. If your hands are sweaty or dirty when you\nuse the sanitizer, that can dilute it and diminish its effectiveness. As for soap, just any old soap works. You don’t need soap marketed as antibacterial,\neven. The FDA says skip it — there’s no proof\nit is any more effective. Just be sure to wash your hands. For 20 seconds. That’s “Happy Birthday” twice. Or the chorus to Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts.” Or Prince. Or Eminem. Or even Dolly. Just as long as it’s 20 seconds.

{"page": 5, "lesson": 10, "title": "Why don't we throw trash in volcanoes?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/6m8NllWS", "transcript": {"en": "Okay, humans, we make a lot of garbage, and we don't have any perfect solutions for what to do with it. So, instead of just putting it under the ground, why don't we just throw it into the volcanoes? Well, as convenient as burning our trash into oblivion might sound, a couple of major reasons to consider. For one thing sending all that trash to the nearest active Volcano could get pretty expensive, especially because lots of places are thousands of kilometers away from a volcano while most cities send their trash tens or hundreds of kilometres to landfills. Some cities also burn a lot of their trash in incineration plants and use that heat to make electricity, so electric bills could go up if we started using volcanoes instead. But different places already handle trash differently, so why don't cities near volcanoes just use them as big flaming trash piles? Well, cost isn't the only problem here. Volcanoes aren't usually the bubbling pits of exposed lava that you see in movies and cartoons. Many volcanoes just look like mountains or hills with a crater near the top and if the craters are filled with anything, liquid water is more common than a lava lake. So you would have to wait for those kinds of volcanoes to erupt and then drop your trash in, which is incredibly dangerous; lots of those eruptions can be pretty violent. Or you can try to drill down into a Volcano's magma chamber, where the Molten rock sits under lots of pressure until eruption. Given how hard it is to predict what exactly will flip a volcano's switch, drilling down into that super pressurized chamber or shooting trash into the magma probably aren't great ideas either. Other kinds of volcanoes like Kilauea in Hawaii have pretty constant calm lava flows. But even though slow-moving lava might seem like a safer and easier way to get rid of garbage, there is another big issue. Clumps of organic matter like food scraps don't just burn when they hit lava, they explode. Very sadly there is little research into why these explosions happen, but there are plenty of experiments and YouTube videos that show pretty clearly that they do, which does not mean that you should, like, give it a try for fun. The most likely explanation is that any water in the trash immediately boils when it hits some thousand-degree molten lava. That steam expands, forcing the trash and lava out of the way to create an explosive fountain of molten rock. But we don't know for sure, so get on it science! What we do know is that with your average american generating a couple of kilograms of trash a day, that would be a lot of exploding lava. Not to mention the stuff that probably wouldn't explode, like plastic, tends to give off dangerous fumes when burned, which is a whole other problem. So even if you live near an active volcano and even if there's lava at the surface and even if it sounds kind of cool, don't use it as your garbage disposal. A controlled science experiment or two may be fine but tons of trash creating noxious lava fountains, not so much. Thanks to our Patreon patrons for asking.

and that style took over inspiring generations of sculptors white marble became the norm along the way our historians reinforce this bias namely this guy Johann Joaquin vinkle Minh he sometimes known as the father of art history in the 18th century he wrote a hugely influential book on ancient art in it he argued that statues like this one the Apollo of Belvedere were the epitome of beauty because the wider the body is the more beautiful it is he went out of his way to ignore obvious evidence of coloured marble and there was a lot of it especially after the rediscovery of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in the 1700s Pompey's near perfectly preserved frescoes featured all sorts of colored statues and one particular mural of an artist in the act of painting a sculpture this colorful sculpture was also found in Pompeii Benkelman claimed it was too primitive to have been made by them but evidence wasn't just ignored some of it might have been destroyed remember Augustus when archeologists rediscovered him in the 1860s they sized his tunic was crimson his armor was yellow and his mantle that's this thing was purple and this is him now it's unclear if Augustus lost his color by accident as a result of over cleaning or if it was removed on purpose but either way the same thing happened to a bunch of other famous monuments and sculptures like the Parthenon in Athens which once looks something like this by the 18th century it had faded to something more like this with just hints of color left but today even those are gone luckily our historians have since shifted to believe it's not about what people think looks better it's about what's accurate but how do they get from this to this to start there are some surviving ancient descriptions of more famous sculptures which is how we know that the Parthenon once held a statue of the goddess Athena that was ivory and gold wearing a helmet adorned with the likeness of his Fink's and if you look closely at some sculptures there's still obvious traces of color like the remnants of deep purple on this Statutes clothing that's how early reconstructions like these are made today scientists can extract and test those tiny samples to determine the original pigments used but when there aren't any visible colors they have another tool ultraviolet light certain pigments glow under UV light exposing traces that would have been otherwise invisible when scientists photograph this archers legs under UV light they saw this a dizzying array of geometric patterns and saturated colors and when they compared it to trace pigments on a similar statue they were able to make this reconstruction which to be clear is about as ancient as mine because conservationists never add color to the original they use 3d scanners to create plaster replicas which they then painstakingly repaint with far greater accuracy than I can [Music] seeing these sculptures in full-color might be a little shocking at first but that's probably because we've only seen them one way for centuries to the Greeks and the Romans painting a sculpture made it complete color can make marble seem human or godlike it infused them with drama and emotion it brought history and mythology to life and even though these reconstructions aren't perfect seeing these statues in color can bring us a little closer to understanding what the ancient world might have looked like [Music]"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But despite all these similarities, they can’t\nspeak So here’s a question.\nCompared to monkeys, birds are nothing like us. Yet this bird’s talking to me right now. How? Birds don’t have lips. They don’t have\nteeth, their “nose” is totally different from\nours, but they do have something we don’t. They actually have a different\nkind of voice box than we do. It's called a syrinx. This is Mya Thompson – She studies birds\nat Cornell University. They actually have two independent voice boxes. In birds, and in humans, the lower respiratory system is shaped sort of like an upside down\nslingshot. The top part is the trachea, or windpipe, the bottom part is the lungs, and\nthese two pieces move air in and out. In humans, the voice box is called the larynx,\nand it’s located above the trachea. It contains vocal “folds” that vibrate when air flows\nthrough to produce sound. And humans primarily shape that sound with\ntheir mouths. But in birds, the voice box is called the\n\"syrinx\". And it’s at the bottom of the trachea. Instead of just sending air through vocal\nfolds like we do, birds actually control the muscles on the walls of the syrinx to shape\nand produce sound. Take a look at this cardinal as it sings. You can actually see that the noise comes\ndirectly from the chest. The bird extends and shortens its neck and opens or closes its\nbeak to refine the noise, but most of the control is actually happening in the syrinx. It’s a powerful sound for such a small animal,\nbut that’s not even the most impressive part: Cardinals tend to make these \"whoop\" notes and they go by very very quickly. They're\nable to produce more pitches than a piano in less than a tenth of a second. They're actually switching from\none side of the syrinx to another seamlessly to make this very very incredible span of\npitches. The syrinx also lets some birds replicate\nsounds with astonishing accuracy. For example, BBC Wildlife caught a lyrebird\nperfectly imitating a camera in the wild And of course, some of them imitate us. Parrots are born communicators. From the start\ntheir brains are wired for speech. So when they're first hatched they're learning right away and they're learning from\neverything around them. But speaking human is no easy feat. We’ve got our vowels\nA - E - I - O - U. Our plosives\n“Pocket”. And a variety of consonants – that we\neven sometimes struggle to enunciate clearly So to pull off such clarity in human speech, parrots\nreally show off their ability to manipulate their vocal tract.\nPlosives, for example, require using our lips. To make up for the lack of lips, parrots use something called esophageal speech – it's almost\nlike burping that comes from within the trachea. The force of air replicates the plosive. As for vowels, where we use our lips, tongue and jaw,\nresearchers have found that parrots move their tongues forward and backward and adjust their\nbeak opening to alter the sound. It seems like they are the only\nbirds that are actually using their tongue like humans do to shape the sound that's coming\nout. Parrots have a natural desire to communicate.\nIn the wild they form strong bonds with their flocks, but in captivity, the parrot forms a social bond with you and they want to communicate with you and\nthey have the vocal anatomy to start mimicking you. When parrots live with us, we’re their flock and they’re determined to sing our song. So in this video I showed you some of the physiology that lets birds produce sounds. But I wanted a quick and easy way to show you some of the interesting background research on the neurology that allows some of them to speak. So I created a website with Wix, where I've compiled a bunch of extras, including research and related content that gets you inside the brains of these animals.

{"page": 5, "lesson": 13, "title": "The coronavirus explained and how you can combat it", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/lqXfeXkP", "transcript": {"en": "In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively.

{"page": 5, "lesson": 14, "title": "How a case gets to the US Supreme Court", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/BOC7SbYP", "transcript": {"en": "Old TV shows made it seem really easy to appeal\nto the Supreme Court. Like when this lady wanted to fight her speeding ticket. Or on Gilligan’s Island, when Thurston Howell\nis locked in a bamboo jail and he says, But even though they make it sound like a right, nobody is entitled to an appearance at the Supreme Court. That’s entirely at the discretion of the Justices and they choose very carefully. Only a small number of cases get to the Supreme\nCourt, and it’s getting smaller. Roughly 8,000 cases are submitted each year,\nbut only 80 cases are accepted. That’s a 1% acceptance rate. And to get to that 1%, most cases start at\nthe bottom. The federal court system consists of three\nlayers and the lowest is the district level. If you lose in a district court you can appeal\nto the circuit level. Most of The United States is divided into\neleven circuits, but there’s a twelfth for DC and a federal circuit that mostly hears patent\nand military cases. Above the circuit level is the Supreme Court,\nthe highest court in the land as long as you don’t count the basketball\ncourt that’s above the Supreme Court. And to get to the Supreme Court, nearly all\ncases require submitting something called a \"petition for a writ of certio- certioror? certiori? “The writ of certiorari”, which is shortened,\nusually, to “the writ of cert”. A petition for the writ of cert is a written\nrequest asking the Supreme Court to hear a case. Instead of asking the court to resolve the facts of a case, which are nearly always settled in lower courts, the reasons for granting the petition concern important questions about federal law. The overarching goal of the court is to make sure that federal law is the same across the country and, so, by federal law I mean the\nUS Constitution and laws passed by Congress. Professor Greene clerked for Justice John Paul Stevens, where he became very familiar with cert petitions. That’s because the clerks review cert petitions\nfor their justices, who then choose to grant a petition if it\npasses “the rule of four”, meaning that four justices want to hear the case. When the court does not grant cert, it does\nnot imply a decision. It doesn’t mean that it agrees with the\nlower court. It doesn’t mean that the individual justices agree with the lower court decision.\nIt just means that the court has decided that this particular case is not a case where the court is going to choose to set law for the whole country. If cert is granted, a case probably falls into one of three categories describing most Supreme Court cases. The first is a case of national importance, such as when the court decided Bush v. Gore in order to help determine who had won the 2000 presidential election. “Drawing on very rarely used legal powers,\nThe Supreme Court has, for the first time in American history, decided to step into\na legal dispute in the midst of a presidential election.\" A second type of case is when a lower court\nissues a ruling that invalidates federal law. An example is \"Gonsalez v. Raich\", in which\nAngel Raich, a California woman, challenged federal drug laws after agents destroyed marijuana plants she had been consuming for medical use. On her appeal in the Ninth Circuit, judges\nruled in favor of Raich, deciding that she was compliant with a state\nlaw authorizing her use of medical pot. But that ruling conflicted with federal law\nprohibiting marijuana use. So when the Ninth Circuit said \"it doesn’t\napply\" that means that if you are medical marijuana user in California then you can use it without\nfear of federal prosecution, but if you are a medical marijuana user in Florida or in New York then it’s still banned under federal law. By ruling on the case, Justices were able to establish the authority of federal law\nprohibiting the use of medical marijuana. In the Raich case, the Supreme Court overruled\nthe Ninth Circuit and said that the federal drug laws can apply to local marijuana use,\nwhich means that someone like Angel Raich can still be prosecuted under federal law\neven though she can’t be prosecuted under state law. Third, the court accepts cases in order to\nresolve a split decision in the lower courts. This happened in the case \"Obergefell v. Hodges\", where a Sixth Circuit ruling that banned same-sex marriage conflicted with rulings in other\ncircuits that had upheld the right to same-sex marriage. Obergefell was someone living in Ohio who wanted to marry his same-sex partner and was not permitted to do so under Ohio law. It made its way to the Sixth Circuit. The\nSixth Circuit said, “you have no right to be married because you are a same-sex couple” and that created a “split”: a division of authority between\nthe Sixth Circuit, which governs Ohio, and a number of other circuit courts. And so, once that happened, it was fairly clear to, I think, most legal observers that the Supreme Court was likely to hear the case because it meant that federal law, the federal Constitution in this case, applied differently in Ohio than it would in Pennsylvania, for example. By ruling in favor of Obergefell, the court\nresolved a circuit split and made same-sex marriage a right nationwide. But these three categories are just a framework for understanding why The Court might select a case. They are not rules. Ultimately, which cases get to the court depends\non the decisions of individuals: the sitting justices of The US Supreme Court."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many cases are accepted by the US Supreme Court per year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "145"}, {"label": "B", "text": "80"}, {"label": "C", "text": "25"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the lowest level of the federal court system?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "District courts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Circuit courts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Supreme court"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

We can answer that question by looking at the rest of the animal kingdom. Are we Homo sapiens any more murderous than, say, monkeys, mice, or meerkats? [Music] A team of researchers in Spain found out by gathering data for more than one thousand mammal species, and they found that killing is actually pretty rare. Okay sure, predators will eat prey, but less than half of the studied species kill members of their own kind. And we humans are nowhere near the top of the chart of the most murderous mammals. We’re not even in the top 30. Some of those top species include obvious ones: predators like lions, bears, and wolves. But the list has surprises too. Cute things like ground squirrels, wild horses, deer. The adorable long-tailed chinchilla is sitting at number 14. And at the number 1 most murderous mammal? The meerkat. They might seem lovable, but around 20 percent of meerkats lose their lives to other meerkats. Primates, the group we belong to, turn out to be an unusually violent bunch. They are 8 times more likely to kill each other than other mammals are. This makes sense: Primates are both territorial and social, two factors that provide the motive and opportunity for murder. So we descend from a group of unusually murderous mammals. But what’s happened since then? To find out, the Spanish team combed through archeological data and historical records. They found that in paleolithic times, lethal violence caused 3.5% of all human deaths, making our ancestors only slightly more violent than the average primate. But as our societies got bigger, our rates of lethal violence increased, rising to around 12% during the Medieval period. But, once we formed large states and became more organized, institutions and the rule of law reduced rates of murder, which are now much lower than in our prehistoric past. The philosopher Thomas Hobbes would have approved. In the 17th century, he argued that modern society protects us from our brutish nature. Not so, said Jean-Jacques Rousseau, another philosopher who believed that humans are naturally good, and civilization is what corrupts us. So did Hobbes win this age old debate? Well maybe, but there's a catch. Some researchers argue that how a mammal species kills its own kind matters more than the rate at which it does the killing. And for primates, the most common MO is infanticide. They kill their babies. But what makes humans so different is that we kill each other as adults at an exceptionally high rate. It is adult homicide that makes us part of a very small club of violent mammals that includes the like of wolves, lions, and spotted hyenas. Human violence may be rooted in our evolutionary past, and we may tamed our lethal proclivities, but like it or not, when it comes to violence, humans are still exceptional.

{"page": 5, "lesson": 17, "title": "Why does smoked brisket taste so delicious?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/WDPt8PPg", "transcript": {"en": "\"Barbecue\"!! The word derives from the word\n\"barabicu\", which to the Taíno people in the Caribbean islands meant \"sacred fire pit\".\nWe are definitely on sacred ground today. If we can get in. [MUSIC] I'm here to learn a little about the science\nof BBQ, so I came to a man who knows a little bit about that, Aaron Franklin... Well that's debatable. How's it going? So what is BBQ? I think BBQ is something that's cooked over\na live fire, so that could encompass grilling, slow offset cooking, cooking in the ground,\ncooking whole hogs over coals, any of those kinds of things I call BBQ, but for me on\na personal level, it's a German/Czech style, offset cooking.\" I experiment all the time, at the end of the\nday feel trumps black and white number or equation you could possibly have. If something's\nnot tender, it's just not tender, if something's dry, it's just too dry. BUT, the science behind\nthese things how wood burns, how airflow works, if you start thinking about fluid dynamics\ninside of a cooker, then science has a pretty huge part of it. I think good BBQ is a balance\nbetween science and natural gut instinct. Cooking is really just thermodynamics and\nchemistry, but tastier. Inside the smoker, air molecules are moving around really rapidly\nthanks to that fire, they're vibrating all crazy, and when they smack into the brisket,\nthey transfer that energy to the meat, either contributing chemical reactions or raising\nthe temperature. Meat browns when it cooks, whether it's direct\nheat like a steak or slow like BBQ. Heat breaks proteins down into amino acids, which then\nreact with sugars to create molecular deliciousness, which happens to be brown. It's not caramelization,\nit's something called the Maillard reaction. King of BBQ here in Texas is brisket. It started\nout with whole animals, you would sell what you could and then whatever was left, as a\nmethod of preservation, you would BBQ stuff on Sundays For us to fully understand the science of\nBBQ, we need to know a little about the hunk of meat we're cooking. Meat in general is\nmuscle, which is primarily protein, fat, some vitamins and minerals, and whole lot of water. Brisket comes from across chest area of cow,\nright here, and since cattle don't have collarbones like us, this muscle has to support more than\nhalf their body weight. That means it's got a lot of three things: hard-working muscle,\nfat, and connective tissue. It's basically the opposite of filet mignon. But if we apply\nthe right kind of science, those three things can come together like Voltron to make something\nvery tasty. So at the end of the day you want it to be\ntender, juicy, good bark, with good fat render. Some of you might not want to hear this, but\nmaking good BBQ is like making Jell-O. Ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, all cuts of meat that\nhave tons of connective tissue, the molecular glue that supports all those muscle fibers.\nCollagen, one of the proteins in connective tissue, can make up a quarter of all the protein\nin a mammal's body. Cook 'em fast, and those proteins snap up\ntight like rubber bands, they have the texture of them too. If you cook them slow, they melt.\nWhen collagen is heated slowly and held there for hours (and hours), its long protein chains\nbreak down and water works its way in. That collagen turns to gelatin, exactly the same\nstuff that's in this box. That's what makes good BBQ so tender inside. It's meat Jell-O. BBQ cuts also have a good amount of fat. Animal\nfats are made of triglycerides which have mostly saturated fatty acids. These have much\nhigher melting points than unsaturated fats like, say, vegetable or olive oil you have\nin your kitchen, because those straight triglyceride tails are stable, packed nice and close. As\nwe heat these saturated fats up, slowly, we can disrupt those hydrogen bonds and turn\nto liquid, called rendering. Which is delicious. Together, melting collagen to gelatin and\nliquefying fat make the meat OH SO TENDER. You need no teeth to eat dis beef. What's fun about an oven? There's nothing\nfun about ovens. Did they have ovens back in the early days, coming up through Mexico?\nNo you dug a hole in the ground, you buried a head, on coals, you cooked on a fire. And\nthat's where I'm coming from more on the traditional side of it. I'm not gonna use electricity,\nnot gonna use gas no assisted heat source of any kind.We have light bulbs, and I don't\neven like that so much. And it tastes good. That gets into a whole\nother thing too, how you're using wood, green wood, dry wood, post oak, hickory, mesquite,\npecan, any of these different kinds of woods they all taste different, they all cook different. The hardwoods used in BBQ smoke have lots\nof cellulose and lignin. When burnt slowly, cellulose caramelizes into sugar molecules\nthat flavor the meat. And lignin is converted into all kinds of aromatic chemicals that\nflavor the meat, and can even act as chemical preservatives.\nYou just can't have brisket, or any BBQ, without that beautiful smoke ring. Now THIS is some\ncool chemistry! Or hot chemistry. Meat starts out pink because it's full of oxygen-carrying\nmolecule called myoglobin. That iron-containing myoglobin starts out red, but as it heats\nup the iron in its heme group oxidizes and it turns this brown color. So why is the ring still red? Well, BBQ smoke\ncontains gases like carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, made by burning wood. That gas diffuse\ninto the edges of the meat, bind to the myoglobin in place of oxygen. And those nitric oxide-myoglobin\ncompounds just so happen to be pink. The edge stays nice and red while the interior gets\nbrown like normal. Kinda the art of working a fire is to control\nthose things and get certain flavors out of a piece of wood. It's not just heat, it's not just the temperature\non a gauge, it's how the smoke is coming out of the smokestack, it's how a piece of wood\nif it flames up and dies out real quick, it's about a heat curve, how long is it gonna last,\nare you forcing a piece of wood to do something it doesn't want to do? You can't really make a piece of meat do what\nyou want it to do, you can only guide it to do what you think you want it to do. So, kind\nof go with that, it's all about trial and error, don't give up, keep working on it.\nAnd if you really wanted to you could watch the BBQ With Franklin videos. Out here we might have beer cans and aprons\ninstead of test tubes and lab coats, but BBQ is SCIENCE, y'all. It's chemistry, it's physics,\nand the best part is you get to eat your experiments. Stay curious. And hungry. I'm gonna go get\nsome food. Special thanks to Aaron Franklin and the whole\ncrew at Franklin BBQ. If you're ever in Austin, Texas, line up early, because this is the\nbest BBQ joint in the US.

Things like, “Don’t eat with your mouth\nopen” or “Don’t run with scissors.\" Another one you might recognize is “don’t sit too close to the TV; it’ll hurt your eyes.\" But it turns out that the science behind that one isn’t actually true—at least, not anymore. Your eyes might start to feel tired, but the\nTV won’t actually hurt them. That idea came from some faulty televisions back in the late 1960s. About 50 years ago, General Electric accidentally released a line of color televisions that emitted X-rays from 10 to 100,000 times more than was considered safe. Talk about a manufacturing flaw. Like most other old, boxy TVs, the GE ones used cathode ray tubes, or CRTs, to generate a picture. Inside the glass vacuum tubes, electrons were fired at a screen covered in red, green, and blue phosphors, a type of material that glows when hit by something like electrons. And when fast-moving electrons strike something in a vacuum, it generates X-rays. To protect people from this radiation, engineers mixed lead into the glass ray tubes— but this batch of GE televisions was produced with faulty tubes. Two pieces were misaligned, which meant that the X-rays were deflected out of the bottom of the TV set and toward the ground right under\nthe television, where some kid was probably singing along to The Flintstones theme song. A recall notice estimated that sitting under the TV for a total of 40 hours would expose someone to so much radiation that their skin would turn red and painful. Which is... not great. But the good news is it doesn’t seem like\nanyone was hurt. Thankfully, modern LCD TVs don’t emit harmful radiation at all, so you can sit as close as you want. But if you do spend too much time binging Netflix, you might still develop a headache. If you stare at the TV—or basically anything, including a book or your smartphone—for too long, you can tire out the muscles in and around your eyes and develop eye-strain. After a while, whatever you’re staring at\nwill start to get wobbly and fuzzy, and you might get a headache or feel tired. Fortunately there’s an easy fix: Go do something else, or at least just look away for a few seconds. Now, kids can focus on things close up much better than adults can without developing eye-strain, which is why they tend to get in the habit of sitting super close to screens—like televisions. And, in the 1960s, that might have been a\nproblem. But today, kids won’t get radiation burns\nby doing it, no matter what their parents say. So the next time you’re in the mood for\na vintage movie marathon, you can sit wherever you’d like. But when Netflix asks you if you’re still\nwatching, it might be time to give your eyes a break.

{"page": 5, "lesson": 19, "title": "Why Starbucks failed in Australia", "category": "Business & Economics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/qeVRVM1s", "transcript": {"en": "Starbucks tiene cafeterías al rededor del mundo. Existen más de 28.000 locaciones y 76 mercados. Desde Shanghái hasta la Bahía de Guantánamo. En China un nuevo Starbucks abre sus puertas cada 15 horas. Pero hay un continente que parece desinteresado en la popularidad de la reconocida cadena de café. Ese continente es Australia, conocida por tener uno de los mercados más difíciles de ingresar. Tan difícil, que Starbucks cerró más de dos tercios de sus cafeterías en el continente en el 2008. Entonces, ¿Qué salió tan mal con Starbucks en Australia? Para responder, volvamos a julio del 2000 cuando Starbucks abrió su primera cafetería Australiana en Sídney. A partir de allí, se expandió rápidamente. En el 2008 Starbucks tenía 87 cafeterías a lo largo del continente. Creo que uno de los problemas fue que ellos pensaron que su problema de negocios podría simplemente desaparecer y no había necesidad de hacer cambios de ningún tipo. Pero ese fue el problema. Intentaron expandir la compañía muy rápido. Starbucks abrió múltiples locaciones rápidamente en vez de integrar las cafeterías lentamente en el mercado Australiano. Cuando lo inauguraron, lo hicieron muy rápido y no le dieron tiempo al consumidor australiano de desarrollar un verdadero apetito por la marca de Starbucks. Ellos también se extendieron a áreas regionales y afuera de los suburbios de ciudades grandes. Para los consumidores australianos Starbucks estaba simplemente muy disponible. No había ni necesidad ni deseo de Starbucks. No fue una expansión orgánica, la cual si ocurrió en los Estados Unidos. En sus primeros siete años en Australia, Starbucks acumuló 105 millones de dólares en pérdidas. En el 2007 Starbucks en Australia estaba colgando de un hilo. Pidiéndole grandes prestamos a los Estados Unidos, totalizando 54 millones de dólares. Y en el 2008 Starbucks anunció que  cerraría 61 cafeterías. Por supuesto que el 2008 fue un año difícil para todos los negocios a causa de la crisis financiera. Además de los cierres en Australia, Starbucks también cerró 600 cafeterías americanas de bajo rendimiento. Aún así, el fracaso en Australia fue embarazosa para la compañía. Cuando le cerraron las puertas de 75 locales a los consumidores australianos, cuando salieron del mercado, o al menos la mayoría de la cadena lo hizo, a los consumidores australianos no les importó. En parte porque los Australianos tienen muchas opciones cuando de café se trata. El mercado del café en Australia es uno de los mercados más exitosos del mundo. Se espera que la industria supere más de seis billones de dólares en ingresos totales en el 2018. Los australianos han estado involucrados  en la industria y cultura del café desde mediados de 1900, cuando los inmigrantes italianos y griegos empezaron a viajar al país. Los inmigrantes introdujeron el espreso a los australianos. En 1980 los australianos estaban completamente sumergidos en la cultura del café. También se han acostumbrado a menus especiales que incluyen “Flat Whites” y macchiatos australianos. Las cafeterías en Australia nacieron de de la cultura italiana, de conocer amigos, de la conversación con tu barista local y de ver esas interacciones como algo que todos tenían en común. El café era parte de esa interacción. Después Starbucks apareció con algo que parecía más una versión americana de la cultura del café, lo cual es esencialmente ver el café como un producto, una mercancía como la cafeinización en la mañana. Starbucks tenía un menú básico y ofrecían muchas bebidas azucaradas, algo que a la mayoría de los australianos no les gusta. En Australia no queremos una taza de café de cien onzas y con mucha azúcar. Queremos algo más sofisticado. Además Starbucks cobra más que las cafeterías locales por lo que los australianos optaron por pagar menos por su café en la cafetería local en la que confiaban. Ellos entraron en el mercado con esta idea de abrir todas esas cafeterías, fue simplemente el mercado equivocado para las costumbres de los australianos. Pero hay una empresa de café americana que está prosperando en Australia. Fundada en Chicago y ahora con base en Australia, Gloria Jean’s obtuvo la reacción que Starbucks no logró. Gloria Jean's tiene más de 400 locaciones en Australia y le sirve a más de 35 millones de consumidores en Australia cada año. Entonces, ¿Que está haciendo Gloria Jean’s en Australia que Starbucks no hizo? La empresa le atribuye su éxito a dos australianos que crearon la franquicia en su país. Las cafeterías abrieron en Australia en 1996. Hoy en día la empresa tiene presencia en cada estado australiano. ¿La razón? Su menú ofrece una gran variedad de bebidas de espreso y cafés especiales. La inadaptabilidad del menú a las necesidades de los australianos fue un error de Starbucks. La compañía enfrenta otro problema a finales de este año: Italia. Starbucks abrirá su primera locación en Milán a finales del 2018. Conocida como el hogar del espreso, Italia es rica en la cultura del café. Pero de acuerdo con Starbucks, la empresa no cometerá los mismos errores cometidos en Australia. La empresa dijo que se expanderá en Italia con humildad y respeto por el café y su cultura. La empresa anunció la apertura de un tostador de café la cual no es la típica cafetería. Le ofrece a los clientes la oportunidad de presenciar el proceso del tostado del café en persona, lo cual podría disminuir el chance de un fracaso como el ocurrido en Australia. Pero Starbucks no quiere darse por vencido en Australia. La empresa está planeando su regreso al continente. En el 2014, los locales de Starbucks en Australia fueron comprados por el grupo Mount Waverley. Starbucks le dijo a CNBC que desde la venta al grupo Mount Waverley, la compañía ha aprendido mucho. Esta vez, Starbucks tomará un enfoque diferente en cuanto a su expansión en el continente. Australia es un destino turístico popular. Hay muchos turistas chinos y americanos. Entonces tiene mucho sentido que Starbucks quiera utilizar eso para su ventaja. Muchos turistas buscan productos que ya conocen, con los que están familiarizados. Con 39 locaciones en Brisbane, Melbourne, La Costa Dorada y Sídney, esta vez la empresa no intentará atraer a clientes australianos, en cambio, la cadena espera ser una cara familiar para los turistas que visitan destinos reconocidos en Australia. Australia siempre ha sido un destino turistico de gran popularidad. Además, el número de estudiantes internacionales en nuestras universidades es grande. Estamos empezando a ver la introducción de Starbucks a centros comerciales grandes aquí en Australia. Australia le dió la bienvenida a nueve millones de turistas entre el 2017 y el 2018 y esos visitantes internacionales gastaron más de 30 billones de dólares en el 2017. Así que los turistas podrían ser la clave para mantener a la compañía a flote, previniendo así otro fracaso. Hola. Gracias por sintonizar CNBC en Youtube.

Sometimes there are nuts. Sometimes dried mango. But the one thing that never sticks around and is gone as soon as we can buy it is the wonderful, beautiful, noble banana. Unfortunately for us, they may not be around forever. [Intro Music] First, the good: bananas are healthy,\npacked with nutrition and energy, they fit in your hand and give nice little\ncues when they're perfectly ripe, and are easy to peel and eat; shocking statistic,\nthe banana is Wal-mart's number one selling item.\nNot the potato chip, not Coca-Cola, not Fifty Shades of Grey, bananas. They\nappear to be so perfect for human consumption that Kirk Cameron attempted\nto use them to prove the existence of God. Of course this banana was not created by\nGod, or really even nature. Bananas, at least the ones that you see at the store, were created by people. Don't get me\nwrong, there are wild banana plants - lots of them - they're native to South and\nSoutheast Asia, and there are dozens of species and\nthousands of varieties. They're just not the ones we eat. Some\nthose species, as you might suspect, have seeds, 'cause that's what fruits\nare, they're fleshy bodies containing seeds. So you might wonder, why have you never\neaten a banana seed? Well, you have... kinda. In cultivated bananas the\nseeds have pretty much stopped existing. If you look closely you can see tiny black specks. Those are all that's\nleft, and they're not fertile seeds. If you\nplant them, nothing grows. Today's bananas are sterile mutants. I'm\nnot trying to be mean, that's just the truth. Unless you were alive in the 1960's (hats off to all those older SciShow viewers out there) every banana you\nhave ever eaten was pretty much genetically identical. This is a Cavendish, the virtually seedless\nvariety that we all eat today, but it wasn't always our banana of choice. Until the\n1960s, everyone was eating the same banana, it\nwas just a different banana - the Gros Michel, a bigger, sweeter fruit\nwith thicker skin. You might notice that banana flavored things don't really\ntaste like bananas. Well they do - they taste like the Gros Michel. The\ngenetic monotony of the Gros Michel crop was its undoing. A fungicide\nresistant pathogen called the Panama disease began\ninfecting Gros Michel crop. By the time growers understood how\nvulnerable their crops were, the Gros Michel variety was all but extinct. The entire banana industry had to be\nretooled for the Cavendish. Since they're seedless, the only way to reproduce them\nis to transplant part of the plant stem, and for the last 50 years we've been\ngood with the Cavendish, 'cause it's more resistant to the Panama\ndisease. However somewhat terrifyingly a strain of Panama disease that affects\nthe Cavendish strain that we all eat has been identified. A global monoculture of genetically\nidentical individuals is a beautiful sight to a pathogen. The fungus only has to figure out how to\ninfect and destroy a single individual, and suddenly there is no diversity to\nstop it, or even slow it down. That's led to a lot\nof scientists worrying about or even predicting the outright demise of the\nCavendish. This wonderful most popular of fruits might\ncompletely cease existence. The good news is we now have a much better\nunderstanding of genetics, epidemics, fungi, and pathology.\nScientists and growers have already taken steps to protect the Cavendish. Some growers are creating genetically\ndifferent bananas that might replace the Cavendish crop if it fails, while\nscientists are attempting to genetically engineer Cavendish plants with immunity\nto Panama disease. Plus we learned a lot from the Gros\nMichel debacle. Infected fields are quickly being destroyed and new crops are\ngrown from pathogen-free lab-grown plant stock. So thanks to the people who work\ntirelessly to grow and harvest bananas and bring them to us so that we can offer them inexpensively\nto our employees, and thanks to the growers and scientists working\ntirelessly to make sure that they don't go the way of the Gros Michel.

{"page": 5, "lesson": 22, "title": "Who owns Antarctica?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/ARtLBL6P", "transcript": {"en": "Antarctica, home to the south pole(s), penguins, and about 5000 people during the summers, but less than 1000 during the ever dark winter. No one lives on the continent permanently, so, who owns Antarctica? Most stuff outside national borders, the sea floor, the moon, really all of space, is the common heritage of mankind. It belongs to none of us and all of us, held in trust for future generations. Which is nice, if perhaps a bit presumptive to say that the entire universe is ours, and maybe someone will have something to say about that eventually, story for another time, but still. Well done humanity. Except, it's never that simple. Because the paperwork on Antarctica sort of says common heritage of mankind, but it doesn't go all in. Here's why. Explorers started landing in Antarctica in about the 1800's, planting flags and making claims. But these claims were a bit hollow because on the civilization tech tree, Antarctica wasn't colonizable. Nonetheless, like Monopoly, the optimal colonial strategy is claim everything you land on. In the early 1900's, the UK toyed with claiming all of Antarctica before scaling back her ambitions to just the coastal parts she had explored to the south pole. France also claimed coastal explorations to the pole, followed by Norway followed by the Nazis. Mid-century, Argentina and Chile claimed slices overlapping with the UK, who they figured was rather too busy at the time to care, but later she and her now independent colonies totally did. This left Antarctica a mess of competing claims, at a bad time to have large territorial disputes. Complicating things, the United States and the Soviet Union gave themselves the right to make a claim on Antarctica, not now, but maybe later. Given this, quite remarkably in 1959 the US and USSR and ten other countries, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, and the UK made a treaty to ease the tensions, saying that on Antarctica, there would be no military, no mining, and no nuclear exploding. The Antarctican paperwork is the first Cold War disarmament treaty, and set aside the continent for science and nature. By the way, because it's a nature preserve, there's a rule about garbage. Leave nothing behind. Nothing. Travel to Antarctica in the summer and you'll fly back with your poo in the winter. So this looks pretty great. What's the problem with the line about common heritage? Well, no one actually gave up their claims on Antarctica because the only way to get everyone to sign was to include this clause, which sidesteps the issue, basically saying countries will act as though Antarctica is the common heritage of mankind and as though they have no claims, but  they aren't legally for realsies giving up anything, which is why maps of Antarctica often include the current state of claim wedges. This blank spot, by the way, is nobody's, leaving it the largest territory unclaimed on Earth by any nation. So far, anyway. Now unlike the colonial days, countries have the tech to build permanently staffed bases on Antarctica, and it just so happens that countries build their bases in their own claims, leaving no clear answer to this question. According to the treaty, Antarctica belongs to everyone, but the treaty itself has an intentional hole. So Antarctica exists in this quantum state where the claims are real and unreal. Some countries build within their \"borders\" and some countries without claims, like China, build their bases on the continent wherever because it belongs to everyone, right guys? These claims don't really matter, until they do in the 2040's when the mining ban comes up for review. Oh, and there's possibly a lot of oil in Antarctica, not to mention 70% of the Earth's fresh water, which could be the more valuable resource in the future. The US and the Soviet... er, Russia might just yet dust off those one free claim because I say so tickets. But for now, Antarctica is as the treaty intended. A continental nature preserve and scientific research haven. Squarespace is the easiest way to create a beautiful website, blog, or online store for you and your ideas.

In an attempt to contain the spill locals turn to an unconventional method: these\nfreaky-looking sausage things are all filled with synthetic materials\nfabricated in a lab. It's also organic stuff you can find on most continents\nand probably in your shower drain. It's human hair. After the Exxon Valdez oil\nspill in Alaska Phil McCroy, a hair stylist in Alabama, had a novel idea for\nthe cleanup effort. On TV he noticed how a sea otter's fur had become saturated with\noil and thought if that's what oil would do to an otter's fur, then the same must\nbe true for human hair. He took scraps of hair trimmings from\nwork, stuffed them into his wife's pantyhose and tested his new invention\nin a small spill he created at his house. NASA's studied and confirmed Phil's\ninvention worked. I called every hair stylist in Alabama 'til I found him. He said that his garage was full of hair being donated from salons all over the\nplace, but he'd never been able to make a business out of it and so from like\nabout 2000, 2001 we were partners. They teamed up on the Clean Wave program. It\ncollects donated hair, fur, feathers, and other fibers to make recycled felted\nmats and hair booms that can mop up oil spills. Turns out hair is pretty good at cleaning up oil. It repels water and can\ncollect contaminants. Water goes into a sponge and it blows up and that's called\nabsorbent but oil coats hair on the outside so like it's called adsorbent. Hair is also natural, cheap, and renewable which makes it an ideal material for\ncleaning up oil spills. Making a hair boom is pretty straightforward. All you need is human hair and pantyhose. Take the hair, stuff it into the hose, and\nvoilà. After getting over the freaky feeling of\nhandling someone else's clumped up hair, place it into contaminated water and\nwatch the hair boom do its thing. There's little diesel spills all the\ntime, so like every little harbor can use that stuff. You know, it was a great way\nto just kind of string from dock to dock and kind of protect your private beaches. But hair booms and hair mats haven't been the principal method to clean major\noil spills. They weren't used extensively in the aftermath of the Deepwater\nHorizon spill, where over the course of 87 days 134 million gallons of oil\ngushed into the Gulf of Mexico. Instead, crews used 1.8 million gallons of\nchemical dispersants, oil skimmers, fire, and booms and barriers made of synthetic\nmaterial to clean up the mess. With oil spills, time is of the essence. The longer oil is in the ocean the harder it is to retrieve. The immediate\necological impact of oil spills is obvious. It kills marine wildlife and\ndestroys habitats and breeding grounds. The chemicals used to clean up oil\nspills also pose a danger to human health. As of now, hair booms and hair\nmats are not the primary tools used to contain oil spills, but possibly one day\nthey could be. It was very interesting for us to see the public desire to help. There's so many hair salons in every city and billions more people\nwith hair to spare. So it's not out of the realm of possibilities that help for\nthe next oil spill maybe just one snip away."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What happens to an organism's fur when exposed to oil?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "there is little or no effect"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the fur of the organism usually repels the oil"}, {"label": "C", "text": "it often becomes saturated with oil"}, {"label": "D", "text": "organisms typically are unaffected by oil spills"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Phil McCrory further developed his \"hair raising\" theory on oil spill cleanup with the help of what equipment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "socks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "human hair"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pantyhose"}, {"label": "D", "text": "b and c only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above are great answers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does the Clean Wave program collect to make their oil booms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "feathers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "human hair"}, {"label": "C", "text": "pet hair"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Hair is great at cleaning up oil due to the fact it is HYDROPHOBIC and BIOSORBENT.
