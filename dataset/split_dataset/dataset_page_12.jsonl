We here at SciShow are looking for answers\ntoo, answers to questions about science and nature and the human body, Earth and the universe! So we're working with Google and YouTube to\nanswer ten of the most popular questions searched for on the internet. This is the World's Most Asked Questions! [Intro] Today’s question is: How can I get rid of\nhiccups? People have all kinds of hiccup remedies that\nthey swear by, none of which seem to have much to do with each other -- like, swallowing\na teaspoon of sugar, or guzzling a glass of water, or just holding your breath. But to figure out how to get rid of hiccups\n-- and why we get them in the first place -- you gotta start with getting to know your\ndiaphragm. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle under your\nlungs that is one of the most important muscles you have, if you enjoy things like breathing. And a hiccup is just an involuntary spasm\nof the diaphragm that causes it to contract suddenly. When that happens, you take in a gulp of air\nreally quickly, until your vocal folds -- the membranes at the top of your throat -- clamp\nshut. That’s what causes the “hic” sound. Most of the time, the spasm stops as quickly\nas it started, and you can just say “excuse me” and get on with your life. But sometimes, those spasms won’t stop ... which\nmeans it’s time to get your diaphragm to relax. To do this, you basically gotta hit the reset\nbutton on your nervous system -- or at least the part that controls your diaphragm. You can do that in a couple of different ways. One is to stimulate your vagus nerve -- that's\na nerve that runs down your neck from the base of your brain, and it regulates some\nof your body’s most important functions, including your heartbeat and your breathing. Basically, you need to stimulate this nerve\n-- distract it, if you will -- so it’ll stop constantly zapping your diaphragm. So, some people have luck getting rid of hiccups\nby swallowing a teaspoon of sugar. Sounds delicious, but it’s harder than it\nsounds. The act of gulping down those dry granules\ncan provide just enough confusing stimulus for your vagus nerve to start focusing on\nyour throat, and leave your diaphragm alone. Another more common approach to kicking the\nhiccups is to increase the level of carbon dioxide in your bloodstream. That might seem a little weird, but your natural\nbreathing rhythms are regulated by your CO2 levels, and if they get too high, your nervous\nsystem will signal your diaphragm and lungs to make sure they’re doing their job. And this is what’s behind most of the hiccup-busting\ntechniques you’ve probably heard of -- like holding your breath, or breathing into a paper\nbag, or drinking a tall glass of water. All of that stuff stops your intake of oxygen\nand ramps up your internal CO2 concentration, which signals your diaphragm to get its head\nin the game and fix things. If the human body weren't so weird, it wouldn't\nbe so fascinating. And speaking of hiccup cures, of those of\nyou who filled out our SciShow Survey, 54% said that holding your breath was your preferred\nmethod for relieving hiccups, while at a close second was drinking water, at 37%.

I just want to thank you so much\nfor helping out in the last episode. I needed to get my phone out of the storm\ndrain, and together, we designed a solution. Our robot was just one of many possible solutions, and maybe you had an even better idea at home. If you did, please send it my way.\nI'd love to check it out! But I've got a whole new challenge for you. Have you ever just wanted\nsome space to yourself? A place to relax, do your own thing,\neat Nutella straight off your fingers, and burp with abandon? Yeah, I need that.\nThat is a thing I need. You know what can help? I bet you already guessed it! Engineering. So how do we use the engineering\nprocess to solve this problem? [Music] Well, first, we've got to define the problem. I need a place that is secluded and quiet. I need it to provide privacy\nand a sense of my-ownness. Sounds pretty great, right? What about a big box to use as my space? It's secluded and it can be all my own. Solution-wise, it's a start, but a small one. We need to consider more options. What if I made adjustments to a\nspace I already have: my room? I could hang blankets from the ceiling\nto help block out sounds from outside, and then I could also sing my\nhead off to T Swift if I wanted to without bothering the rest of my family. To top things off, I could add\na \"Do Not Enter\" sign to my door. Like, a serious sign. \nBold font, all caps. Respect my sign! Okay, we've got two options. What else? What if instead of adjusting a space\nI already have, I create a new space? There's a word for what we're\ntalking about here: architecture. Maybe we could become not just engineers,\nbut architects: engineers who design buildings. Even though the title of the job is a little\ndifferent, the process is still the same. So before doing architecture, we've got to weigh our options and choose\nthe best design to take into trials. Let's think about the box idea first. It's probably too small. I'd either be squished or\nbe half hanging out of it. Okay, how about tricking out my room? Again, while I'd feel like I have a sense\nof privacy, I'd know that at any point, any one of my family members could bust in, and the blankets on the walls \nwould muffle some of the sound, but wouldn't totally block them out. But hey, here's an idea:\nwhat about a tree house? It would be totally my own, it would be far enough from my house that any weird burps or loud renditions\nof \"Shake It Off\" wouldn't bug my family. Of course, it would take some\nwork. Some architecture work. So architect, activate!  [Music] Let's build the treehouse! It'll have a drop-down rope ladder that\nI can pull up for optimal privacy, and it'll have windows so I can spot\nwhen someone's on the way over and properly prepare myself. I can even use the blanket wall idea from\nmy second proposal to muffle the sound. Of course, I'll need space for lounging\nand reading and dancing around, but before we start building,\nyou know what we've got to do? Build the prototype and test it. And in order to conduct useful trials,\nwe need to isolate the variables. What are the variables of\nthis particular mission? The size of the treehouse we choose\nand the weight of the treehouse are really important variables\nbecause we gotta make sure the treehouse can stay in the tree. What about variables when it comes\nto soundproofing the thing? The number and the size of the\nblankets that I use would be one, and so would be the amount of noise\nI plan on making inside the treehouse. And we have to keep in\nmind failure points, too. Like, the tree might be able to support\nlittle old me in a small wooden tree house, but if I have a friend or two over,\nthe load might be too heavy. That would be a serious failure point. As for keeping things nice and quiet,\nmaybe my thickest heaviest blankets can block a soft rendition\nof \"You Belong With Me,\" but they might fail when I belt out\n\"Shake It Off\" or have a burping contest. You've gotta test these things! So we'll keep working with the variables\nuntil we've got a working design. Then, it's time to build. [Music] Architects use the same process,\nthe engineering process, when planning buildings from\nskyscrapers to small family homes. I came up with what I think\nwill be a great treehouse, but as always, there can be lots\nof different successful solutions. So here's your challenge: can you come\nup with your own architecture solution? What would your building look like? How would it meet the success\ncriteria and navigate the variables? Let us know!

With Black History in the United States, many\nAfrican-Americans mention Malcolm X. Do you know who Malcolm X is? Malcolm X was an African-American Civil Rights\nActivist and Minister. Right now we will learn a little bit about\nhis life. Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little on May 19,\n1925 in Omaha, Nebraska. Malcolm was the fourth of eight children born\nto Louise, a homemaker, and Earl Little, a preacher. His father spoke out against racism and was\noften picked on by a group named the Ku Klux Klan. It was so bad the littles had to move from\nOmaha and his father was later found murdered. After the death of Malcolm’s father, Malcolm's\nmother became very sick and could not take care of her children. This is where Malcolm and his siblings were\nplaced in foster care. Seeing all of this Malcolm would get into\ntrouble later on finding himself in a juvenile detention center, and later on finding himself\nin prison after getting in trouble. It was there his life would change when he\ndiscovered a religion known as Islam. After choosing the religion of Islam and joining\nthe Nation of Islam, Malcolm Little would soon change his name from to Malcolm X, where\nhe would go on to be a well-known leader of the Nation of Islam. During this time another African-American\nCivil Rights Activist was Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Although Dr. King spoke about peaceful protests,\nMalcolm X was known for saying, “By any means necessary,” and \"You don't have to\nhave a peaceful revolution,\" when speaking against racism. Malcolm X would later leave the Nation of\nIslam and become a traditional Muslim where he changed his name to El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz. Malcolm X’s life came to an end after he\nwas assassinated on February 21, 1965, in New York, New York. That is all for me and I hope you enjoyed\nlearning about Black History and Malcolm X a civil rights activist and preacher.

{"page": 12, "lesson": 4, "title": "Can you solve the world’s most evil wizard riddle? - Dan Finkel", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-world-s-most-evil-wizard-riddle-dan-finkel", "transcript": {"en": "The evil wizard MoldeVort \nhas been trying to kill you for years, and today it looks like \nhe’s going to succeed. But your friends are on their way, \nand if you can survive until they arrive, they should be able to help stop him. The evil wizard’s protective charms \nward off every spell you know, so in an act of desperation \nyou throw the only object in reach at him: Pythagoras’s cursed chessboard. It works, but with a catch. MoldeVort starts in one corner \nof the 5x5 board. You have a few minutes to choose \nfour distinct positive whole numbers. MoldeVort gets to say one of them, \nand if you can pick a square on the board whose center is exactly \nthat distance away, the curse will force him \nto move to that spot. Then he’ll have to choose \nany of the four numbers, and the process repeats until \nyou can’t keep him inside the board with legal moves. Then he’ll break free of the spell \nand almost certainly kill you. What four numbers can you choose \nto keep MoldeVort trapped by your spell long enough for help to arrive? \nAnd what’s your strategy? Pause the video to figure it out yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The trick here is to keep MoldeVort \nwhere you want him. And one way to figure out how to do that is to play out the game \nas MoldeVort would: always trying to escape. You’re dealing with a relatively \nsmall board, so the numbers can’t be too big. Let’s start by trying 1, 2, 3, 4 \nto see what happens. Moldevort could escape those numbers\nin just three moves. By saying 2, then 3, he would force you to let him into one\nof the middle points of the grid, and then a 4 would break him free. But that means you’ll need to allow\na number larger than 4, which is the distance from one end \nof a row to another. How is that even possible? Through diagonal moves. There are, in fact, points that are \ndistance 5 from each other, which we know thanks \nto the Pythagorean Theorem. That states that the squares \nof the sides of a right triangle add up to the square of its hypotenuse. One of the most famous \nPythagorean triples is 3, 4, 5, and that triangle is hiding all over \nyour chessboard. So if MoldeVort was here, and he said 5,\nyou could move him to these spaces. There’s another insight that will help. The board is very symmetrical: \nIf MoldeVort is in a corner, it doesn’t really matter \nto you which corner it is. So we can think of the corners \nas being functionally the same, and color them all blue. Similarly, the spaces neighboring \nthe corners behave the same as each other, and we’ll make them red. Finally, the midpoints of the sides \nare a third type. So instead of having to develop a strategy for each of the 16 spaces \non the outside of the board, we can reduce the problem to just three. Meanwhile, all the inside spaces \nare bad for us, because if MoldeVort ever reaches one, he’ll be able to say any number \nlarger than 3 and go free. Orange spaces are trouble too, \nsince any number except 1, 2, or 4 would take him to an inside space \nor off the board. So orange is out and you’ll need \nto keep him on blue and red. That means 2 is bad, since it could take MoldeVort \nto orange on the first turn. But the four other smallest numbers, \n1, 3, 4, and 5, might work. Let’s try them and see what happens. If MoldeVort says 1, you can make \nhim go from blue to red or red to blue. And the same works if he says 3. Thanks to our diagonals, \nthis is even true if he says 5. If he says 4, you can keep him \non the color he’s already on by moving the length of a row or column. So these four numbers work! Even if your friends don’t get here \nright away, you’ll be able to keep \nthe world’s most evil wizard contained for as long as you need."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the dimensions of the cursed chessboard?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4 by 4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5 by 5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6 by 6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8 by 8"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many numbers do you need to pick to start the enchantment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What do the numbers do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They specify the distance Moldevort must move."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They specify the time Moldevort must spend in each spot."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They specify how much money Moldevort must pay you."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They don’t do anything."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How can MoldeVort get free?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "If he can overpower the spell with magical strength."}, {"label": "B", "text": "If he can’t make a legal move without going off the board or off the center of a square."}, {"label": "C", "text": "If he finds the enchanted chess pieces."}, {"label": "D", "text": "If he can reverse the spell using a symmetry spell."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How is distance measured on the chessboard?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Straight line distances from the center of each square."}, {"label": "B", "text": "By the number of moves it would take a King to get from one square to another."}, {"label": "C", "text": "By the number of moves it would take a Rook to get from one square to another."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Based on the number of all possible routes between squares."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

{"page": 12, "lesson": 7, "title": "How do you know if you have a virus? - Cella Wright", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-virus-tests-actually-work-cella-wright", "transcript": {"en": "A new virus emerges \nand spreads like wildfire. In order to contain it, researchers must first collect data \nabout who’s been infected. Two main viral testing techniques \nare critical: one tells you if you have the virus and the other shows \nif you’ve already had it. So, how exactly do these tests work? PCR, or polymerase chain \nreaction testing, targets the virus’s genetic material \nin the body and is used to diagnose someone \nwho is currently infected. Yet, this genetic material may be present \nin such imperceptible amounts that actually detecting it is difficult. This is where PCR comes in: it’s widely used to amplify genetic \ninformation to large enough quantities that it can be readily observed. To develop a PCR test \nfor a never-before-seen virus, researchers first sequence \nits genetic material, or genome, and identify regions that are unique \nto that specific virus. PCR then targets \nthese particular segments. A PCR test begins by collecting a sample: this can be blood for hepatitis viruses, \nfeces for poliovirus, and samples from the nose or throat \nfor coronaviruses. The sample is taken \nto a central laboratory where PCR is performed to test \nfor the presence of the virus’ genome. Genetic information can be encoded \nvia DNA or RNA. HPV, for example, uses DNA, \nwhile SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, uses RNA. Before running the PCR, \nthe viral RNA— if present— must be reverse transcribed \nto make a strand of complementary DNA. Researchers then run the PCR. If the virus is present in the sample, \nits unique regions of genetic code will be identified by complementary \nprimers and copied by enzymes. One strand of DNA becomes \nhundreds of millions, which are detected using probes marked\nwith fluorescent dye. If the PCR machine senses fluorescence, the sample has tested positive \nfor the virus, meaning the individual is infected. Immunoassays, on the other hand, tap into the immune system’s \nmemory of the virus, showing if someone has previously \nbeen infected. They work by targeting virus-specific\nantibodies generated by the immune system during infection. These are specialized classes of proteins that identify and fight foreign \nsubstances, like viruses. Immunoassays may detect IgG antibodies, \nthe most abundant class, and IgM antibodies, the type that’s first \nproduced in response to a new infection. The presence of IgM antibodies suggests \na recent infection, but since it can take the body over \na week to produce a detectable amount, they’re unreliable in diagnosing \ncurrent infections. Meanwhile, IgG antibodies circulate \nfor an extended period after infection; their presence usually indicates \nthat someone was exposed and recovered. Before the immunoassay, health professionals draw blood \nfrom an individual. This sample then comes into contact \nwith a portion of the virus of interest. If the body has, in fact, been exposed \nto the virus in the past, the body’s virus-specific antibodies \nwill bind to it during the test. This reaction produces a change in color, \nindicating that the sample tested positive and that the individual has been \nexposed to the virus. Immunoassays are especially important when it comes to retroactively \ndiagnosing people who were infected but went untested. And there’s exciting potential for those\nwho have developed immunity to a virus: in some cases, their blood plasma \ncould be used as treatment in people who are currently fighting it. PCR and immunoassays are always \nin the process of becoming more accurate and efficient. For example, innovations in PCR have led to the use\nof self-contained testing devices that relay results within one hour. Digital PCR, which quantifies individual \npieces of target DNA, shows promise in further\nboosting accuracy.

{"page": 12, "lesson": 8, "title": "Why do bats carry so many diseases? (like coronavirus)", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/CnfJm2rX", "transcript": {"en": "Nipah. Hendra. Ebola. Marburg. SARS. These\nare some of the world’s scariest viruses. Hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola are extremely\nfatal – they kill up to 90 percent of people infected – while SARS, a coronavirus, has\na lower mortality rate but spreads incredibly rapidly. All of these nasty pathogens have\nsurfaced in humans in just the last 50 years, and they are all carried by bats. Which, to be clear, really isn’t bats’\nfault: the recent rise in outbreaks is likely due to humans and our animals creeping ever-farther\ninto bats’ territory, especially in the tropics. In Malaysia, for example, the spread\nof commercial pig farms into bat-inhabited forests led to the first human outbreak - via\npigs - of Nipah. And in Australia, human hendra cases are cropping up as destruction native\nforests forces fruit bats to feed in suburban gardens. But still: bats do appear to carry more human-killing\ndiseases than pretty much any other animal. One big reason is that, with a few notable\nexceptions, bats love company  — different kinds of bats  often roost together in huge\nnumbers and close quarters, which helps viruses spread not just between individuals, but also\nbetween species . What’s more, most infected bats don’t\ndie — they live pretty normal bat lives,  flapping around and giving the viruses time\nto spread. In fact, flight may be the reason bats are so resilient to infection. As a rule, mammals can’t produce the immense\namount of energy needed for flight without also producing a lot of reactive waste products\nthat damage our DNA. So when our bat cousins took to the air, they leveled-up their in-flight\nDNA damage repair kits and other defenses, including specialized cells that keep viral\ninvaders in check. So bats can survive the deadly viruses - but\nwhat may matter even more, for humans anyway, is how the viruses survive the bats. Nasty as they are, most viruses are also extremely\nfinicky — in order to thrive, they require the perfectly controlled climate inside a\nnormal, resting, on-the-ground mammal. But when bats take to the air, their internal\ntemperatures cruise to around 40°C. Those frequent in-flight saunas are far too toasty\nfor your average virus, but a few hardy viruses have evolved to tolerate the heat.  Which,\nincidentally, means they can definitely weather a meager human fever. Essentially, flight\nmay have helped bats gain virtual immunity to viruses AND trained viruses to be virtually\nimmune to us. Stupid flying. So, what should we land-lubbers do? We need\nbats for insect control and pollination - and a whole bunch of other things - maybe we could\neven learn some immune tricks from them - like how to be really good at not getting cancer!\nPlus, bats aren’t the biggest carriers of human disease. Humans are - just do the math.\nPerhaps we’d be better off leaving bats alone, and trying to control the spread of\ndiseases carried by a different kind of flying mammal."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Hemorrhagic fevers like ebola", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "are not contagious"}, {"label": "B", "text": "have no side effects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "kill up to 90 percent of the people affected"}, {"label": "D", "text": "are not spread by bats"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why might have all these deadly viruses seem to have emerged in the last 50 years?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "they have become more contagious"}, {"label": "B", "text": "humans and their animals are entering into bats' environments"}, {"label": "C", "text": "as forests are destroyed, bats move into suburban areas"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both b and c are good answers"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above are good answers"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Bats are a vital part of ecosystems due to the fact they", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "pollinate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "eat insects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "they can purify the air"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both a and b"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

{"page": 12, "lesson": 10, "title": "What is a coronavirus? - Elizabeth Cox", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-a-coronavirus-elizabeth-cox", "transcript": {"en": "For almost a decade, scientists chased \nthe source of a deadly new virus through China’s tallest mountains \nand most isolated caverns. They finally found it here: \nin the bats of Shitou Cave. The virus in question was a coronavirus that caused an epidemic \nof severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003. Coronaviruses are a group of viruses covered in little protein spikes \nthat look like a crown— or \"corona\" in Latin. There are hundreds \nof known coronaviruses. Seven of them infect humans, \nand can cause disease. The coronavirus SARS-CoV causes SARS, \nMERS-CoV causes MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 causes \nthe disease COVID-19. Of the seven human coronaviruses, \nfour cause colds, mild, highly contagious infections \nof the nose and throat. Two infect the lungs, \nand cause much more severe illnesses. The seventh, which causes COVID-19, \nhas features of each: it spreads easily, \nbut can severely impact the lungs. When an infected person coughs, \ndroplets containing the virus spray out. The virus can infect a new person when\nthe droplets enter their nose or mouth. Coronaviruses transmit best \nin enclosed spaces, where people are close together. Cold weather keeps their delicate casing\nfrom drying out, enabling the virus to survive \nfor longer between hosts, while UV exposure from sunlight \nmay damage it. These seasonal variations matter more \nfor established viruses. But because no one is yet immune \nto a new virus, it has so many potential hosts that it\ndoesn’t need ideal conditions to spread. In the body, the protein spikes embed\nin the host’s cells and fuse with them— enabling the virus to hijack \nthe host cell’s machinery to replicate its own genes. Coronaviruses store their genes on RNA. All viruses are either RNA viruses \nor DNA viruses. RNA viruses tend to be smaller, \nwith fewer genes, meaning they infect many hosts \nand replicate quickly in those hosts. In general, RNA viruses don’t have \na proofreading mechanism, whereas DNA viruses do. So when an RNA virus replicates, it’s much more likely to have \nmistakes called mutations. Many of these mutations are useless \nor even harmful. But some make the virus better suited\nfor certain environments— like a new host species. Epidemics often occur when a virus \njumps from animals to humans. This is true of the RNA viruses \nthat caused the Ebola, Zika, and SARS epidemics, \nand the COVID-19 pandemic. Once in humans, the virus still mutates— usually not enough to create a new virus, but enough to create variations, \nor strains, of the original one. Coronaviruses have a few key differences \nfrom most RNA viruses. They’re some of the largest, \nmeaning they have the most genes. That creates more opportunity \nfor harmful mutations. To counteract this risk, \ncoronaviruses have a unique feature: an enzyme that checks for replication \nerrors and corrects mistakes. This makes coronaviruses \nmuch more stable, with a slower mutation rate, \nthan other RNA viruses. While this may sound formidable, the slow mutation rate \nis actually a promising sign when it comes to disarming them. After an infection, our immune systems \ncan recognize germs and destroy them more quickly \nif they infect us again so they don’t make us sick. But mutations can make a virus \nless recognizable to our immune systems— and therefore more difficult to fight off. They can also make antiviral drugs \nand vaccines less effective, because they’re tailored \nvery specifically to a virus. That’s why we need a new flu vaccine\nevery year— the influenza virus mutates so quickly \nthat new strains pop up constantly. The slower mutation rate \nof coronaviruses means our immune systems, drugs, \nand vaccines might be able to recognize them \nfor longer after infection, and therefore protect us better. Still, we don’t know how long our bodies\nremain immune to different coronaviruses. There’s never been an approved treatment\nor vaccine for a coronavirus. We haven’t focused on treating \nthe ones that cause colds, and though scientists began developing\ntreatments for SARS and MERS, the epidemics ended before those \ntreatments completed clinical trials. As we continue to encroach \non other animals’ habitats, some scientists say a new coronavirus \njumping to humans is inevitable— but if we investigate these unknowns, \nit doesn’t have to be devastating."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Coronaviruses are a bit different from other RNA viruses.

{"page": 12, "lesson": 14, "title": "Fabulous food chains", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/91mBGLUU", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] Not everybody likes the same kind of food, right? That's probably a good thing. \nI mean, all the more pizza for me! But whether we eat milkshakes or mangoes, \npizzas or pears, tacos or toast, we use the energy that's in \nour food to stay alive. But how did that energy get\n into our food in the first place? The answer is that energy \nflows between living things. It's almost like each form of food \nis a link in a chain...a food chain! You might have heard that humans are on the top of the food chain because we eat pretty much everything, and except for the occasional \nvideo game monster and maybe the odd bear, \nnothing tries to eat us. But what is a food chain, exactly? A food chain is a model that shows \nhow energy flows between living things. You can think of animals and plants in the same food chain as all living in the same neighborhood, \nwhich scientists call a \"habitat.\" And they all have a job to do, \ninteracting with each other, day in and day out. Together, they form a kind of system. A self-contained collection of different things \nthat all work together as a whole. And, they also interact with the \nnon-living stuff around them, like the water, the air, the ground, and the sun. Put it all together, and what do you get? A special system \ncalled an \"ecosystem!\" And food chains show us \nwhat eats what in an ecosystem. Now, everything that's alive is in a food chain. Including you, my friend! And actually, most living things \nare in more than one food chain, depending on what, or who, \nthey're munching on at the moment. I mean, you don't eat the same thing \nfor dinner every night, do you? Didn't think so! Now, let's see how a food chain works, by making a diagram of how \nthese interactions happen in nature. First, all of the energy that's \nin a food chain starts with the Sun. I can't stress that enough, people! Plants take the energy from the Sun's rays and change it into chemical energy. So, when a nice patch of \nlush, green grass starts to grow, it's capturing some of the energy \nfrom the Sun to do it. Then when an animal, like a rabbit, \nwanders by and nibbles on that grass, the energy from the plant is \ntransferred into the rabbit's body. Now, if hungry hawk decides that the \nrabbit would make a yummy supper, then the energy from the rabbit \nis transferred to the hawk. And in this ecosystem, nothing is large \nor brave enough to take on the hawk. I mean, just look at her! So, we've hit the top of the food chain, and we've just made a nifty model of it. So, a food chain is a model that shows how energy flows between living things in an ecosystem. Energy in a food chain starts with the Sun, which is turned into chemical energy by plants. And this energy moves up the food chain \nas animals eat the plants, and then other animals eat those animals. And speaking of energy, I'm starving! So I'm off to take my place in the food chain.

{"page": 12, "lesson": 15, "title": "Why don't haircuts hurt?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/NbkK68D6", "transcript": {"en": "[ ♪ Intro ♪ ] It’s that time again! I’m getting a haircut later today. lots of people get them   Sometimes people decide to cut their hair\nmuch shorter, and sometimes they just get a trim, like I am. Even Squeaks had a little trim when he got\na piece of gum stuck his fur, remember, Squeaks? [Squeaks squeaks] But there’s something that all haircuts\nhave in common: They don’t hurt! When you think about it, it might seem kind\nof weird that they don’t. I mean, if you get a cut on almost any other\npart of your body, like your finger, it definitely hurts! But when someone cuts your hair, as long as\nyou hold very still, it doesn’t hurt at all! There’s also another place on our bodies\nthat it doesn’t hurt to cut, and we do it all the time. Can you guess what it is, Squeaks? [Squeaks guesses] That’s right — our nails! The reason it doesn’t hurt to cut your hair,\ntoenails, or fingernails is that they don’t have nerves inside them. A nerve is a type of body part you have all\nover the inside of your body, kind of like how you have muscles all over. These nerves have a special job to do: they\ncarry messages between different places in your body. Now, you have lots of body parts. So nerves have lots of jobs. But one of the biggest jobs nerves have is\nto help you sense the world around you. Nerves are the reason you can see, hear, smell,\ntaste … and yes, feel things! Nerves are a big part of the sense of touch. Squeaks, can I touch your nose to show how\nthis works? [Squeaks squeaks] When you touch something [taps Squeaks on\nthe nose], it brushes up against your skin. And, like most parts of your body, your skin\nhas nerves in it. When something touches your skin, it activates,\nor kind of ‘turns on’ the nerves. These nerves can feel all kinds of different\nthings. Some of them feel whether something is warm\nor cold. Others can help us tell if something is smooth\nor rough. And there are also some that are in charge\nof sensing pain. When I tap Squeaks’ nose, some of the nerves\nin my finger get switched on, and each one sends a message. Those messages travel through my hands … up\nmy arm … through a big bundle of nerves that’s in my back … and all the way to\nmy brain! Then, my brain decodes the messages. It checks if I’ve ever touched anything\nlike this before, and combines that with any other information it can get, like if I can\nsee the thing I’m feeling. This all happens really fast, which is how\nI can figure out what I’m touching right away — Squeaks’ nose! [Squeaks sneezes] Oh, I’m sorry ! I guess your nose is kinda\nticklish, Squeaks! So, our sense of touch takes more than just\nour hands. It also takes our nerves, and our brains,\ntoo! But what about our hair? Well, try this. Pat the top of your head. Just like the skin that’s on your fingers,\nthe skin that’s under your hair has nerves. So your fingers can feel the top of your head,\nand your head can feel your fingers touching it! Just like how Squeaks felt my finger with\nhis nose. Now find the very end of a piece of hair and\ntry squeezing it, without pulling on it at all. Your fingers can feel your hair, but your\nhair can’t feel your fingers! That’s because there are no nerves inside\nyour hair. And as long as you’re not pulling on your\nhair, or moving it around too much, you’re not going to feel a thing. The same goes for the very ends of your fingernails\nand toenails. They don’t have nerves in them either. No nerves means no sense of touch, so they\ndon’t feel anything. And if there’s no sense of touch, there’s\nno pain. So the next time you get a haircut, now you’ll\nknow why it doesn’t hurt! [Squeaks squeaks] Yikes, you’re right Squeaks — I should\ngo if I don’t want to be late for my haircut!

{"page": 12, "lesson": 16, "title": "Why is my leg asleep?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/qB5N9AZC", "transcript": {"en": "♪INTRO♪ Hey, Squeaks... (Squeaks squeaks) Oh, I'm ok. My leg just feels kinda weird... It’s tingling, but in a way that feels prickly! [Squeaks Squeaks] Oh yeah, you're right! I think my leg is asleep! Maybe this has happened to you before, too. Sometimes if you’ve been doing something\nthat presses on your arms or legs for a while, like sitting in one position or leaning on\nyour elbow, it’ll start to go numb and you can’t feel as much with that part of your\nbody. Then, once you move so you’re not sitting\nor leaning that way anymore, your arm or leg starts to get all prickly, almost like you’re\ngetting lots of tiny pokes all over, even though there’s nothing actually poking you. People sometimes call that feeling pins and\nneedles. And that sounds a lot like what happened to\nme! It’s something that can feel pretty weird,\neven though it happens to people all the time. When we say that an arm or leg fell asleep,\nwe don’t really mean that it was asleep the way you are when you fall asleep at night. It’s just called that because you can’t\nfeel much with it while it’s numb, almost like it’s sleeping. And that tingling, pins and needles feeling\nyou get when you shift your position is kind of like your arm or leg is waking up! You get that prickly feeling because your\nbody is a little bit confused. You might already know that there’s blood\nmoving everywhere in your body all the time, pumped through little tubes called blood vessels\nby your heart. It’s really important that the blood moves\nthrough all the parts of your body, because that’s how they get energy so they can work\nproperly. But when you sit in one position or lean on\nyour arm or leg for a while, you’re pressing on those blood vessels and making the tubes\nsmaller, so not as much blood can get through. And without enough blood, your arm or leg\ncan start to go numb. The reason you can feel something when you\ntouch it is because of little things called nerves that are all over your body. Whenever you pick up a toy or touch something\nthat’s hot or cold or hurts, these nerves are like little messengers that tell your\nbrain all about what you’re touching. But the nerves only work well if they’re\ngetting enough blood. I must have sat in a way that was pressing\non his leg for a few minutes, the nerves in my leg weren’t getting enough blood. So my leg stopped being able to feel as much\n— it went numb and fell asleep. But then I moved! And once my body wasn’t pressing on his\nleg anymore, more blood started moving through it again and his nerves woke up. But nerves get a liiiittle confused when they\nwake up. At first, they don’t really know /what/\nyou’re feeling. They start telling your brain that you’re\nfeeling tiny little pokes, even though nothing is really touching you! That’s where the pins and needles feeling\ncomes from. Pretty soon, your nerves get used to having\nenough blood again and go right back to normal. So to keep yourself from getting pins and\nneedles, you can just make sure you don’t sit or lean in one position for too long. And if you do get them, all you have to do\nis just wait. You can shake around the arm or leg in the\nmeantime to help the blood get flowing again, but either way, the prickling will go away\nafter a minute or two. Whew, Squeaks! It feels like my nerves are finally getting\nback to normal! My leg is better now! But now the next time I get pins and needles,\nI’ll know all about why it happens. And so will you!
