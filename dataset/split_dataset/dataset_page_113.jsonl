Levy", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-transplant-a-head-to-another-body-max-levy", "transcript": {"en": "On March 14th, 1970, Robert White\nand his team carted two small monkeys into an operating room. The neurosurgeon lay on the verge\nof an ambitious experiment, decades in the making,\nwhich was bizarre, if not pulled straight\nfrom his own fever dream. White’s objective? Connect the head of Monkey A\nto the body of Monkey B, in what he considered\na whole-body transplant. White’s ultimate goal was to one day\nperform this surgery on humans. While disturbing,\nthe idea of a body transplant raises ethical, biological,\nand philosophical questions— on the nature of life\nand the limits of science— that are still discussed today. But first, is it even medically possible? White's surgery faced several\ntechnical hurdles. For one thing, it guaranteed paralysis as no doctor then— or now—\ncould reconnect a severed spinal cord. But White,\na practicing neurosurgeon, thought the surgery could be life-saving for his patients with spinal cord injuries\nor progressive mobility diseases like ALS. These patients often face\nmulti-organ failures and paralysis, so with a body transplant, he hoped to save their lives by replacing\nall of their organs at once. But paralysis wasn't the only challenge. Due to their high energy demands, brain cells require a constant supply\nof oxygenated blood to survive. Yet the transplant surgery would likely\ninterrupt the brain’s oxygen flow for hours. But White had an idea. When the brain is cold, its metabolism slows down\nand it relies less on oxygen. Experimenting on dogs and monkeys, White optimized a brain-cooling technique where the brain’s blood flow was\nselectively chilled and halted, while the rest of the body’s blood\nremained warm and circulated. Then, in 1964, White successfully cooled\nthe brain of a human patient with a life-threatening brain tumor\ninto “suspended animation” at 11°C. Whereas normally the surgical team\nwould have just 3 to 5 minutes to remove the tumor, with this new technique, they operated for over an hour\nwithout causing damage. Brain cooling revolutionized\nthe field of neurosurgery and put White one step closer\nto his body transplant goal. But this vision was fraught\nwith serious ethical concerns. What conditions would justify\nsuch an experimental surgery, that could result in debilitating pain\nand neurological damage? And how many animals would have to die\nto prove it was possible? At the time, bioethics\nwas still an emerging field. Nevertheless, numerous critics, including\nmany in the scientific community, recognized the cruelty of White's research\nand strongly opposed it. Yet White continued to gain approval\nfrom agencies like the NIH. And by 1970, he was ready to attempt\na monkey body transplant. First Monkey A was installed\nwith temporary blood vessels— coils of plastic tubes that tethered\nthe head to the body. Plastic tube by plastic tube,\nthe team connected Body B to Head A, and then waited for the subject\nto awake from anesthesia. The monkey did— alive, paralyzed,\nand extremely distressed. According to the team, the monkey\ncould see, smell, hear, and even tried to bite off\none of the doctors’ fingers. White felt this proved that the operation\ncould work. The brain appeared to survive\na head transplant and, with high doses of drugs,\ncould live without immune rejection. But had White performed\na body transplant on Monkey A? Or was it a head transplant on Monkey B? The surgery raises questions\nabout the mind-body divide that have been debated for millennia. While modern neuroscience supports\nthe central role of the brain in building out our consciousness, discoveries about gut neurons\nand the microbiome suggest that the answer\nmay be more complicated. Does part of the “self” reside\noutside of the mind? The body and brain are interconnected\nby circuits and signaling systems; so, what is lost by separating the two? As a neurosurgeon, White performed\nmore than 10,000 brain operations before retiring in 1998— but never the human head transplant\nhe dreamed of. Since then, several scientists have\nexpressed interest in picking up where White left off,\nreviving unfinished debates. Even if a doctor could successfully\nconnect a patient’s head to a donor’s body, who of the two would emerge?

Their directive was to retrieve\na poison pill from the freezer and slip it into the chocolate milkshake\nof Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader who was known to devour\nup to 18 scoops of ice cream after lunch. While exact details of the story are\ncontested, it's rumored that the pill, however, froze to the freezer coils\nand broke, foiling the CIA’s plan and granting Castro\nmany more days to satiate his sweet tooth. Ice cream has held a unique role in our\nworld’s history, culture, and cravings— but where did it come from? The first accounts of cold desserts\nand iced drinks date back as early as the first century. In civilizations including ancient Rome,\nMughal India, and Tang dynasty China, these icy treats were mainly enjoyed\nby the royal elites. And finding the means to freeze\nthese delicacies wasn’t always easy. Wealthy Mediterranean nobility sent\nlaborers to trek up high mountains to harvest glacial ice and snow. Meanwhile, ancient Persians built\nshallow insulated pools of water and utilized a technique\nknown as sky cooling. At night, the shallow pools would\nnaturally radiate heat into the dry desert skies, causing them to dip below the\nambient temperature and freeze. Yet the cream-based treat we know today\nmade a much later debut. It was originally inspired by sherbet,\nor sharbat in Arabic, an icy drink believed to have\noriginated in Persia, and subsequently gained popularity\nin the Middle Ages. European travelers brought\nsharbat recipes home, and began creating their own\nchocolate, pinecone, and even eggplant flavored\ntakes on the refreshment. In 1692, Antonio Latini,\na Neapolitan chef, recorded a recipe for a\nunique milk-based version, which some historians dub\nthe first ice cream. In the 18th century,\nice cream expanded its reach as these recipes set sail alongside\nEuropean settlers to North America. Yet it was still mainly enjoyed\nby the upper classes as the process to make it\nwas quite laborious, and its main ingredients—\nsugar, salt, and cream— were expensive. George Washington is said to have spent\nthe equivalent of $6,600 in today’s dollars on ice cream\nin one summer alone. It was on American soil that the\nfrozen dessert entered its golden age, as inventors and entrepreneurs began to\nengineer ways to bring it to the masses. In Philadelphia in 1843,\nNancy Johnson patented a revolutionary ice cream-making machine\nfeaturing a crank and beater, which made the process easier\nfor any home cook. And storing ice cream was no longer\nan obstacle, as by the mid-1830s, New England businessman “Ice King”\nFrederic Tudor had greatly improved the ice trade, shipping thousands of tons of ice\nto households across the globe. Soon, ice cream was\non every street corner. In the late 1880s, political turmoil\nbrought Italian immigrants to cities like London, Glasgow, and New York, where many took up jobs as street vendors\nselling licks of ice cream for roughly a penny each. Meanwhile, American druggists discovered\nthe appeal of combining soda, a drink thought to have therapeutic\nproperties at the time, with ice cream, and a new social spot was born:\nthe soda fountain. When the sale of alcohol\nwas banned in 1920, many American saloons reinvented\nthemselves as soda fountains, and breweries like Anheuser-Busch\nand Yuengling pivoted to producing ice cream. At the same time, refrigeration technology\nwas improving rapidly. By the end of World War II, the average American home had a freezer\nthat could house a quart of ice cream. Even trucks could be equipped\nwith freezers full of frozen treats. Today, ice cream continues\nto take on new forms. And while some of its mysteries\nmay never be solved, one thing is certain:\nour love for ice cream will never thaw."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How early are the first accounts of iced desserts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the first century"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the second century"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the third century"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the fourth century"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the technique known as \"sky cooling\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "using moon beams to cool desserts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "keeping desserts out of the sky"}, {"label": "C", "text": "using the wind to cool desserts"}, {"label": "D", "text": "keeping desserts in a pool of water over night to cool them"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "From what language does the word \"sherbet\" originally come?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Persian"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arabic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Greek"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Latin"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Where was the first milk based ice cream invented?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "France"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Italy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Egypt"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When did the average American home have a freezer that could house a quart of ice cream?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "by the end of the Cold War"}, {"label": "B", "text": "by the end of WWI"}, {"label": "C", "text": "by the end of the Vietnam War"}, {"label": "D", "text": "by the end of WWII"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Pump one unit of energy\ninto an electric toaster and you get about one\nout in the form of heat. That’s just the first law\nof thermodynamics: energy has to be conserved. But there's a piece of technology\ncalled a heat pump, where for every bit of energy you put in,\nyou get 3 to 5 times as much heat out. What wizardry is this? Heat pumps have been hailed\nas a climate-friendly heating solution to traditional heaters, most of which operate\nby burning fossil fuels. So much so that in 2021, heating buildings was responsible\nfor about 10% of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Heat pumps reduce emissions in two ways— first, they run on electricity, meaning less fossil fuel use as grids\nmake the switch to renewable energy. And second, they're more efficient\nthan their counterparts, using less energy to produce\nthe same amount of heat. Where a typical oil or gas boiler is,\nat best, about 90% efficient, some heat pumps can achieve\n500% efficiency. Heat pumps rely on the same technology\nas air conditioners. And in fact, they often double\nas air conditioners, heating your home in the winter\nand cooling it in the summer. How? Air conditioners take heat\nfrom your home and move it outside. To do so, they harness the second law\nof thermodynamics. That’s the one that says that heat will\nalways move from a hotter object to a colder one. When you turn on your A/C, a fan blows the hot air from your home\nover coils containing a substance\ncalled a refrigerant. A refrigerant’s molecules turn to gas\nat relatively low temperatures, so as it collects thermal energy\nfrom the hot air in your home, it boils. Then, it passes into a compressor, which pushes the gas molecules\ncloser together, heating them up even more. Now that gas is hot—\nway hotter than the outside air. So when a fan blows over the refrigerant, thermal energy transfers to the\ncomparatively cold air outside. As the refrigerant releases heat,\nit starts to liquefy. It goes through an expansion valve,\nwhich decreases the pressure, causing it to get even colder. Now, it’s ready to pick up more heat\nfrom your house and start the cycle again. In winter, heat pumps work\nexactly the same way. But this time they pick up heat\nfrom outside and move it into your home. Of course, it’s sometimes freezing outside\nwhen you want to use your heater. But the air doesn’t need to be warm— it just needs to be warmer than the\nrefrigerant to transfer its heat. All this sounds great, but for now there\nare some drawbacks to this technology. First, refrigerants can be\npotent greenhouse gases. Hydrofluorocarbons are some\nof the most popular refrigerants. But a single hydrofluorocarbon molecule\ncan have 2,000 times the global warming impact of CO2. While in use, the refrigerant stays\ncontained in a closed loop. But when heat pumps, A/Cs, and\nrefrigerators are improperly installed or thrown into landfills,\nthe refrigerant can leak out. So scientists are trying to create\nnew refrigerants that are better for the environment. Also, the colder it is outside, the less efficient an air-to-air\nheat pump will be. Nevertheless, over half the buildings\nin icy Norway use heat pumps. Some people there have opted for pumps\nthat draw heat from under the ground, which stays more consistently warm,\nrather than heat from the air. Finally, there's the cost. In the US, installing a small heat pump\nusually costs several thousand dollars, though some people need\nmore powerful systems, depending on the size of their home\nor the temperature in winter. Often they’re only a little more expensive\nthan installing a new A/C system, and the heat pump can save money\non utilities in the long run. But replacing a working system requires\nan upfront investment that a lot of people just don’t have. Still, as the risks\nof climate change loom, many countries are offering subsidies\nto help with the costs. And some cities are creatively harnessing\nseas, sewage, and data centers as heat sources,\nusing heat pumps in manufacturing, and even creating giant heat pumps\nfor entire districts. So, are heat pumps actually breaking\nthe first law of thermodynamics? Of course not. They’re just not using\ntheir electricity to make heat. They're using it to power the compressor\nand spin the fans. They get the extra energy for free—\nfrom heat in the air or underground. Which is how, by putting in 1 unit\nof energy, you get 3 to 5 units of heat out.

Inside the Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestants between 8- and 15-years-old\nwrestled words like brachydactylous and leguleian. Outside, a crowd protested the complexity\nof English spelling conventions. Indeed, spelling reformers have\nbeen around for centuries, advocating for overarching changes to make\nEnglish spelling more intuitive. The English language is chock-full\nof irregularities. One commonly used example of this:\ntake the “g-h” sound from “enough,” the “o” sound from “women,”\nand the “t-i” sound from “action,” and you could argue that\n“g-h-o-t-i” spells “fish.” So, how did English get like this? English arose from old Germanic\ntribes that invaded the British Isles more than 1,500 years ago. Their languages coalesced and evolved\ninto Old English. When Roman missionaries arrived\naround 600 CE, they devised ways to write it\ndown using the Latin alphabet, supplementing it with some Germanic runes\nfor sounds they didn’t have letters for. Then came the Norman invasion of 1066\nwhen French speakers conquered England. French became the language\nof authority and high society. But English remained the dominant\nspoken language. Over time, those descended from French\nspeakers also became English speakers, but some French words snuck\ninto the language. Some English speakers were also familiar\nwith Latin through the church and formal education. By the mid-1400s, people were writing\nin English again— but it was unstandardized. They used a mix of influences to determine\nword choice and spelling, including the French they knew,\nthe Latin they studied, and the English they spoke. So, things were already pretty messy. Then, in 1476, the printing press\narrived in England. Some of the people working the presses\nmay have mainly spoken Flemish— not English. And they were given manuscripts\nthat varied widely in their spelling. Without standardization, different writers\nwent with various spellings based in part on what they happened\nto encounter while reading. Many words had a multitude of spellings. The word “dough,” for instance, used to be spelled in all these ways\nand was originally pronounced “dach.” The guttural Germanic sound it ended with\nwas one the Latin alphabet didn’t cover. It eventually came to be\nrepresented with “g-h.” But, for some “g-h” words, English speakers eventually dropped\nthe guttural sound altogether; for others, they ended up pronouncing\nit as “f” instead, as exemplified in “dough” versus “tough.” Printing presses memorialized\nthe spelling even though the pronunciation\neventually changed. And this wasn’t just the case with “g-h.” Some letters in other words\nalso fell silent: words like knife, gnat, and wrong all contain the vestiges\nof past pronunciations. But while the printing press\nwas solidifying spellings, the English language was also undergoing\nwhat scholars call the Great Vowel Shift. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, the way English speakers pronounced\nmany vowels changed significantly. For instance, “bawt” became “boat.” This displaced the word for “boot,” which had up until then\nbeen pronounced “boat,” and pushed it into the high “u” vowel\nposition it maintains today. Words that already had this high “u”\noften became diphthongs, with two vowels in a single syllable. So, “hus” became “house.” As with so many linguistic matters,\nthere's no clear reason why this happened. But it did. And how the vowel shift affected a word\ndepended on various things, including the other sounds in the word. The word “tough” was once “tōh,”\namong other variations. “Through” was once “thruch”\nand “dough” “dah.” These words all started\nwith different vowel sounds that were then affected differently\nby the vowel shift. The “o-u” spelling they all adopted was\na haphazardly applied French influence. So, eventually they wound up with\nstill distinct vowel sounds, but similar spellings\nthat don’t really make much sense. All this means English can be\na difficult language for non-native speakers to learn. And it reveals the many ways history,\nin all its messiness, acted upon English,\nmaking it especially tough."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Spoken English originated from old ______ languages.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Germanic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Romance"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Baltic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Celtic"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After the Norman invasion of 1066, French became the language of _____ in England.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Everyone"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The ruling class"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The printing press"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Farm workers"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The printing press came to England in ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1476"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1066"}, {"label": "C", "text": "600 CE"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1614"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The 'gh' spelling was originally used for ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A vowel sound"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A sound Latin didn’t have"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A 'g' sound"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A 'v' sound"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Great Vowel Shift affected how English vowels were pronounced ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In Old English"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Before spelling was standardized"}, {"label": "C", "text": "After spelling was standardized"}, {"label": "D", "text": "While spelling was being standardized"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Alex is enthusiastic about the idea,\nbut you can’t get over the statistics. You know a lot of marriages end\nin divorce, often not amicably. And over 10% of couples\nin their first marriage get divorced within the first five years. If your marriage wouldn’t\neven last five years, you feel like tying the knot\nwould be a mistake. But you live in the near future, where a brand-new company just\nreleased an AI-based model that can predict your likelihood\nof divorce. The model is trained on data sets containing individuals’\nsocial media activity, online search histories, spending habits,\nand history of marriage and divorce. And using this information, the AI can predict if a couple\nwill divorce within the first five years of marriage\nwith 95% accuracy. The only catch is the model doesn’t offer\nany reasons for its results— it simply predicts that you will or won’t\ndivorce without saying why. So, should you decide whether or not\nto get married based on this AI’s prediction? Suppose the model predicts you and Alex would divorce within five years\nof getting married. At this point, you'd have three options. You could get married anyway\nand hope the prediction is wrong. You could break up now, though there’s no way to know if ending\nyour currently happy relationship would cause more harm than letting\nthe prediction run its course. Or, you could stay together\nand remain unmarried, on the off-chance marriage itself\nwould be the problem. Though without understanding the reasons\nfor your predicted divorce, you’d never know if those mystery issues\nwould still emerge to ruin your relationship. The uncertainty undermining\nall these options stems from a well known issue with AI\naround explainability and transparency. This problem plagues tons of potentially\nuseful predictive models, such as those that could be used\nto predict which bank customers are most likely to repay a loan, or which prisoners are most likely\nto reoffend if granted parole. Without knowing why AI systems\nreach their decisions, many worry we can’t think critically\nabout how to follow their advice. But the transparency problem\ndoesn’t just prevent us from understanding these models, it also impacts the user’s accountability. For example, if the AI's prediction\nled you to break up with Alex, what explanation could you\nreasonably offer them? That you want to end\nyour happy relationship because some mysterious machine\npredicted its demise? That hardly seems fair to Alex. We don’t always owe people\nan explanation for our actions, but when we do, AI’s lack of transparency can create\nethically challenging situations. And accountability is just one\nof the tradeoffs we make by outsourcing important decisions to AI. If you’re comfortable deferring\nyour agency to an AI model it’s likely because you’re focused\non the accuracy of the prediction. In this mindset, it doesn’t really matter\nwhy you and Alex might break up— simply that you likely will. But if you prioritize authenticity\nover accuracy, then you'll need to understand\nand appreciate the reasons for your future divorce\nbefore ending things today. Authentic decision making like this is\nessential for maintaining accountability, and it might be your best chance\nto prove the prediction wrong. On the other hand,\nit’s also possible the model already accounted for your attempts\nto defy it, and you’re just setting yourself\nup for failure. 95% accuracy is high, \nbut it’s not perfect— that figure means 1 in 20 couples\nwill receive a false prediction. And as more people use this service, the likelihood increases that someone\nwho was predicted to divorce will do so just because the AI\npredicted they would. If that happens to enough newlyweds, the AI's success rate could\nbe artificially maintained or even increased by these\nself-fulfilling predictions.

Rome was in need of swift,\ndecisive action, and the senate had chosen him\nto serve as dictator, with absolute power over the military\nand government. Cincinnatus set down his plow,\ntook control and, in a matter of weeks,\nsaved Rome. This story reinforces the myth\nof the “benevolent dictator”— the idea of a leader who\nholds absolute power, yet only uses it for the common good, \nto address problems efficiently, and create a just regime. But can a truly benevolent dictator\nexist in today’s world? Nations established modern democracies\nto safeguard against the potentially destructive whims\nof a single individual. When functioning properly,\ndemocracies enable a society to be freer, and provide stability by protecting\nagainst corruption and the abuse of power. This is accomplished by holding regular,\nfree, and fair elections, imposing term limits, and establishing strong legislative\nbranches and court systems. Maintaining a free press also helps keep\npoliticians accountable for their actions and encourages citizens to engage\nin their governments and communities. In a dictatorship,\nabsolute or near-absolute power is held by a single individual who is free to impose their vision\non society. Under certain conditions, the idea\nof a dictator can sound appealing, like when a democracy isn't functioning\nas it should due to corruption, economic instability,\nor extreme political polarization. At these moments, people may be willing to give up some\ndemocratic rights and freedoms for hopes of a better future. Authoritarian-leaning leaders\npresent themselves as the ones who can fix everything. They distill complex problems\ninto simple talking points and promise quick solutions. Some of the most overt authoritarian\nleaders have taken this strategy, including military dictators who seized\ncontrol through coups like Augusto Pinochet, Mobuto Sese Seko,\nand Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi, for example, initially asserted\nhimself as a revolutionary hero, canceling the country's exploitative\nforeign oil contracts. But the longer he was in power,\nthe more riddled with paranoia he became. Like Pinochet and Mobuto, he used his\nposition to target and torture opponents, embark on campaigns of mass violence\nagainst everyday people, and build an enormous personal fortune. Other modern dictators were initially\nelected democratically, then strategically accumulated power by\nembracing authoritarian forms of control. Italy’s Benito Mussolini and\nGermany’s Adolf Hitler, for example, gained popularity during waves\nof mass discontent. Both channeled economic woes\ninto racist rhetoric and embraced fascism, a type of authoritarianism which exalts\nthe importance of one nation, or race, above all others. Once in office, such leaders gradually\ndismantle checks on their power, including removing judges who might rule\nagainst them, abolishing term limits, or refusing to acknowledge\nunfavorable election results. Since they punish dissenting voices, dictators are often surrounded\nwith yes-men, who are promoted based on loyalty\nover expertise, ultimately wreaking incalculable economic,\nsocial, and environmental costs. But these costs can also\nbe hidden from view. Dictators build up cults of personality\nby minimizing negative coverage and pushing positive propaganda\nthat presents them as strong or heroic. This can make it almost impossible\nto accurately measure their success. Did Mussolini really make\nthe trains run on time? It’s hard to know, since he would have\npunished those who said otherwise. While some modern dictators have\nbrought modest growth to their nation’s economies\nand industries, most have enriched the few and left\nwidespread destruction in their wake. Even so-called benevolent dictators,\nwhose regimes lacked overt violence, stand accused of censoring journalists and limiting the rights\nand freedoms of citizens. Back to ancient Rome. Perhaps the most important dimension of Cincinnatus’ legendary \nbenevolent dictatorship is not that he held total power, but that he gave it up after only 16 days. Once Rome was safe,\nhe stepped down and retired to his fields. His willingness to relinquish control\nto the senate was as important to the common good\nas his ability to fend off invaders. In practice, no modern dictator\nhas lived up to this ideal. Dictators don’t willingly walk away\nfrom power, they continuously crave more. That’s why institutions that provide\nchecks on leaders must be safeguarded: in the hands of an aspiring dictator, even seemingly robust democracies can sink into repressive,\nauthoritarian regimes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Ancient Roman statesman Cincinnatus is an example of a(n) ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wealthy oligarch"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elected sovereign"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Authoritarian despot"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Benevolent dictator"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following common features of a democracy can make a dictatorship sound appealing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Free press"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Political polarization"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Strong legislative branch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Regular elections"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How do authoritarian leaders present themselves to appeal to the masses?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As people who can fix everything"}, {"label": "B", "text": "As people with the highest education"}, {"label": "C", "text": "As people with altruistic intentions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "As people with an ability to be ruthless"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In what political climate do authoritarian dictators often rise to power?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Times of national unity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Times of creative flourishing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Times of economic hardship"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Times of industrial development"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What makes Cincinnatus such a unique ruler?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He held power peacefully for many years."}, {"label": "B", "text": "He walked away from power."}, {"label": "C", "text": "He accepted input from advisors."}, {"label": "D", "text": "He created a system for succession.

Over the following hundreds\nof millions of years, more microorganisms began producing\nthis toxic gas, first saturating Earth's oceans\nand eventually its atmosphere. Up here, this chemical changed\nthe composition of pre-existing gases so drastically that it caused\na global ice age. And the name of this powerful, poisonous,\nworld-changing gas? Oxygen. In the millions of years since\nthe Great Oxygen Catastrophe, most life, including all\nmulticellular organisms, have evolved to rely on this gas. However, there are some places\nwhere oxygen-averse microorganisms, like those from Earth's earliest days,\nhave re-emerged. Many of these places are\nin the ocean depths, beyond the reach of researchers. But there are other bodies of water\ncompletely devoid of oxygen, yet close enough to the surface\nto explore. And one such lake is hidden high\nin the Swiss Alps’ Piora Valley. Formed over 10,000 years ago, Lake Cadagno is one of roughly 200\nknown meromictic lakes, meaning it's actually two distinct bodies\nof water stacked on top of each other. The top layer functions like\na standard body of freshwater. It’s safe for swimming and known mostly\nfor a plump and plentiful fish population that’s been the subject\nof local fishing legends for centuries. But just 13 meters beneath that bounty\nis a dense, sulfurous, oxygen-free pool lethal to any multicellular life forms,\nfish included. In a typical lake, the entire\nbody of water would gradually mix, diffusing oxygen\nfrom the surface throughout. But these two layers never mix,\nas is the case with any meromictic lake. And the reason for this divide in Cadagno is the waters’ unique\nchemical compositions. Both layers are fed by rainwater\nflowing down the mountains, however, this water can take two paths. The first is to trickle down the granitic\nmountain directly into the top layer. The second is to seep into the\nPiora Valley’s vein of dolomite— a porous rock full of salts\nsuch as sulfate. Rainwater that sinks into the dolomite\nwill slowly inch towards the lake, all the while shedding its oxygen\nand picking up salts. Finally, this heavier water will cascade\nfrom sublacustrine springs below the lake’s surface, forming the dense,\nsalt-rich bottom layer. This lower layer is anoxic,\nmeaning oxygen free, and will suffocate any\noxygen-dependent life. But it’s ideal for the kind\nof anaerobic bacteria that died off in the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. The flow from the sublacustrine springs\ncreates microenvironments which feed large aggregates\nof microorganisms that emerge from the lakebed\nin strange and otherworldly shapes. Various anaerobic microorganisms\ntake in the water's sulfate and emit toxic sulfide. And at the border of these layers, there’s a thin blanket mainly composed\nof pink-bodied Chromatium okenii: a photosynthesizing bacterium\nthat relies on this sulfur the way most plants rely on oxygen. However, while neither water nor organisms\nmove between the layers, these ecosystems aren’t\ncompletely out of touch. Chromatium okenii live\nat the top of the bottom layer because they need to be as close\nto the sun as possible. But while they never cross\ninto the deadly oxygenated waters, they’re close enough that organisms\nlike zooplankton can dive down, eat them, and get back up. In fact, this relationship forms\nthe bottom of the upper layer’s robust food chain supporting the lake’s\nlegendary fish population. This unique ecology is more than\njust a boon for Cadagno’s fishermen. Having access to an isolated\nanaerobic ecosystem allows scientists to model the world\nbefore the Great Oxygen Catastrophe. For example, when Chromatium okenii\nform their blanket, they increase the density\nof that thin layer of water. As the water sinks, these microorganisms\nare forced to swim back up, creating a minute mixing of water\ncalled bioconvection. This billions of years old phenomenon\nmight be a clue to how early life evolved\nthe ability to swim. And it’s just one of the many insights\nthat await researchers studying Cadagno’s mysterious depths."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long ago did oxygen appear in the primordial oceans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "300,000 years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3 billion years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oxygen was always present"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3 million years ago"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How often does a meromictic lake completely mix?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Once"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Twice"}, {"label": "C", "text": "More than two times"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Never"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Where is the meromictic Lake Cadagno located?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Swiss Alps"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rocky Mountains  "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Andes "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Himalaya"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What kind of organisms live in the oxygen-deprived lower part of the meromictic Lake Cadagno?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only fish"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Anaerobic microorganisms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Algae and fish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only algae"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the pink anaerobic microorganism Chromatium okenii able to do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Live forever"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kill fish"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mix the water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Produce oil"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

I have 44 slides and 720 seconds. Let's light this candle. (Laughter) OK so for those of you who don't know me, I'm actually a global television store. True story. I've had four TV series\nin the last three years. Two of them have been canceled\nbefore they were launched, and two were canceled within six weeks. Let's recap. (Video) If we want to juice this thing, if we want to put a cattle prod\nup the ass of the economy. Bloomberg. The most trusted name in financial news. Not for long. Andrew Yang: I'm going to do\nwhatever I can for this country of ours. Scott Galloway: Jesus, come on, dude,\nyou’re 0 for two. (Video ends) Face for podcasting. So first insight of the day. I'd like to be the first person\nto welcome you to the last TED. (Laughter) OK. By the way, it's clear --\nwhat's it called? What are we here for? “The Brave and the Brilliant?” It's clear that Chris is a frustrated\nsoap opera producer. (Laughter) Essentially what we have here\nis a telenovela where, after a night of unbridled passion between Bill Gates and Malcolm Gladwell, they give birth to their\nbastard love child, Simon Sinek. (Laughter) OK, I start us with a question. Do we love our children? Sounds like an illegitimate\nquestion, right? Well, I'm going to try\nand convince you otherwise. Essentially, as we go down generations, we're seeing that for the last\ntwo generations, people are making less money\non an inflation-adjusted basis. In addition, the cost of buying a home, the cost of pursuing education,\ncontinues to skyrocket. So the purchasing power, the prosperity,\nis inversely correlated to age. Simply put, as we get younger, we're taking away opportunity\nand prosperity from our youngest. The social contract\nthat is now no longer in place and for the first time\nin the US's history, a 30-year-old is no longer doing as well\nas his or her parents were at 30. This is a breakdown in the fundamental\nagreement we have with any society, and it creates rage and shame. (Applause) As a result, people over the age of 55\nfeel pretty good about America, but less than one in five people\nunder the age of 34 feel very good about America. This creates an incendiary. Righteous movements, cuts to our society end up becoming\nopportunistic infections because generally speaking,\nyoung people have a warranted envy, they're pissed off and they're angry that they don't enjoy\nthe same spoils and prosperity that were provided to our generation. A decent proxy for how much we value\nyouth labor is minimum wage, and we've kept it purposely pretty low. If it had just kept pace\nwith productivity, it'd be at about 23 bucks a share. But we've decided\nto purposely keep it low. Out of reach. Median home price has skyrocketed\nrelative to median household income. As a result, pre-pandemic, the average\nmortgage payment was 1,100 dollars, it's now 2,300 dollars because of an acceleration\nin interest rates and the fact that the average home\nhas gone from 290,000 to 420. By the way, the most expensive\nhomes in the world, based on this metric,\nare number three, Vancouver. Why? Because 60 percent of the cost\nof building a home goes to permits. Because guess what, the incumbents\nthat own assets have weaponized government to make it very difficult for new entrants\nto ever get their own assets, thereby elevating their own net worth. This is the transfer I'm going\nto be speaking about. (Applause) This has resulted in an enormous\ntransfer of wealth, where people over the age of 70 used to control 19 percent\nof household income, versus people under the age\nof 40, used to control 12. Their wealth has been cut in half. This isn't by accident, it's purposeful. This is me at UCLA in 1987. I know your first thought is\nI haven't changed a bit. (Laughter) This is also Mia Silverio, who is the analyst\nwho put together these slides. By the way, Mia is 26. I did the math, just by virtue\nof her being in this audience, it brings the average age\nof the entire conference down 11 days. (Laughter) When I applied to UCLA,\nthe admissions rate was 76 percent. Today, it's nine percent. I received a 2.23 GPA from UCLA. I learned nothing but how to make\nbongs out of household items and every line from \"Planet of the Apes.\" And the greatest public school\nin the world, Berkeley, decided to let me in with a 2.27 GPA. And that's what higher ed is about. Higher ed is about taking\nunremarkable kids and giving them a shot\nat being remarkable. (Applause) And every year it's gotten more expensive. Higher ed and homes and the ability -- not only is higher ed\nincredibly expensive, it's not accessible. Because me and my colleagues\nare drunk on luxury, and I'll come back to that. We've embraced the ultimate strategy. Me and my colleagues in higher ed\nwake up every morning and ask ourselves the same question\nwhen we look in the mirror. How can I increase my compensation\nwhile reducing my accountability? (Laugter) And we have found the ultimate strategy. It's called an LVMH strategy, where we artificially constrain supply\nto create aspiration and scarcity such that we can raise tuition\nfaster than inflation. And old people and wealthy people\nhave done the same thing with housing. All of a sudden, once you own a home, you become very concerned with traffic, and you make sure that there's no\nnew housing permits. And here is a memo\nto my colleagues in higher ed: we’re public servants,\nnot fucking Chanel bags. (Applause) Harvard is the best example of this. They've increased their endowment\nin the last 40 years and have decided\nto expand their enrollment, their freshman class, by four percent. Any university that doesn't grow\ntheir freshman class faster than population that has over a billion dollars\nin endowment should lose their tax-free status because they're no longer\nin higher education. They're a hedge fund offering classes. (Cheers and applause) My first recommendation: Biden should take some of that 750 billion earmarked to bail out the one third\nof people that got to go to college on the backs of the two thirds that didn't and give a billion dollars to our 500\ngreatest public institutions, size-adjusted, in exchange\nfor three things. One, they use technology and scale\nto reduce tuition by two percent a year, expand enrollments by six percent a year and increase the number\nof vocational certifications and nontraditional four-year\ndegrees by 20 percent. Where does that get us? In just ten years, in just ten years, that doubles\nthe freshman seats and cuts the cost in half. This isn't radical. This is called college\nin the '80s and '90s. Another transfer of wealth. Look at what's happened to wages. Oh, they've gone up? Not as much as corporate profits. There's a healthy tension\nbetween capital and labor. But for the last 40 years, capital\nhas been kicking the shit out of labor. Well, you think, what about wages, right? They've gone up. Well if you compare them\nto the S and P, they barely register. It's been an amazing time to own assets. But your attempt to get\nthe certification or the income such that you can acquire assets\nhas gotten harder and harder. In my class of 300 kids, it's never\nbeen easier to be a billionaire, it's never been harder\nto be a millionaire. By the way, our job in higher ed isn't to identify a top one\npercent of people who are freakishly remarkable\nor have rich parents and turn them into a super\nclass of billionaires. It's to give the bottom 90\na chance to be in the top ten. (Applause) You know who doesn't need me\nor higher education? The top 10 percent. The whole point of higher ed is to give\nthe unremarkables, i.e. yours truly, who was raised by a single\nimmigrant mother, a shot of being remarkable. The transfer has been purposeful. While the cohorts, corporations\nand the ultra-wealthy continue to garner more\nand more of our wealth, we have decided,\n\"I know, if they win the gold, let’s give them the silver and the bronze,\nand let’s lower their taxes.” This transfer is purposeful. It’s not by accident, and it works. Senior poverty is way down,\nand we should celebrate that. Meanwhile, child poverty\nis flat to up. The third rail. I'm going to talk about Social Security. It would cost 11 billion dollars\nto expand the child tax credit. But that gets stripped out\nof the infrastructure bill. But the additional 135 billion dollars\na year to Social Security, that flies right through Congress. And every year we transfer\n1.4 trillion dollars from a cohort that is\nincreasingly doing less well to the cohort that is\nthe wealthiest cohort in the history of this planet. I'm not against Social Security,\nbut the criteria should be if you need it, not whether you have a catheter. 80 percent of you, 80 percent of you\nhave absolutely no reason to ever take Social Security. It is bankrupting our nation. And we have fallen under this mythology that somehow it's this\ngreat social program. No it's not. It's the great transfer of wealth\nfrom young to old. (Applause) How is this happening? Because our representatives\nare in fact, representative. Old people vote. Washington has become a cross between the \"Land of the Dead\"\nand \"The Golden Girls.\" (Laughter) Quite frankly, this is fucking ridiculous. And if I sound ageist -- (Applause) If I sound ageist, I am. And you know who else is ageist? Biology. (Laughter) When Speaker Pelosi had her first child, get this, two thirds of households\ndidn't have color televisions, and Castro had just declared martial law. But she's supposed to understand the challenges of a 17-year-old girl\nwho’s 5′ 9\", 95 pounds, getting tips on dieting and extreme\ndieting from Facebook? She's supposed to understand\nthe challenges that a 27-year-old single mother faces? By the way, young and dreamy. (Laughter) Young and dreamy. (Applause) The great intergenerational theft\ntook place under the auspices of a virus. I know, let's use the greatest\nhealth crisis in a century to really speed-ball the transfer. This is the Nasdaq from 2008 to 2012. We let the markets crash. And by the way, you need churn, you need disruption because it seeds\nand recalibrates advantage and wealth from the incumbents to the entrants. It's a natural part of the cycle. But wait, lately, no, a million people dying would be bad. But what would be tragic\nis if we let the Nasdaq go down and guys like me lost wealth. So we pumped the economy, which again, increased\nthe massive transfer of wealth. The best two years of my life? Covid -- more time with my kids,\nmore time with Netflix, and the value of my stocks\nabsolutely exploded. And who has to pay for my prosperity? Not me. Future generations who will have to deal\nwith an unprecedented level of debt. Why am I here, and why do I\nget the prosperity I enjoy? Because in 2008 we bailed out the banks, but we didn't bail out the economy. We let the markets fall. So as I was coming into my prime\nincome-earning years, I got to buy, no joke,\nthese stocks at these prices. This is where those stocks are now. Where does a young person find disruption? When you bail out the baby boomer\nowner of a restaurant, all you're doing is robbing opportunity\nfrom the 26-year-old graduate of a culinary academy that wants her shot. We need disruption. (Laughter) I just like this slide. It has no context or relevance. (Laughter and cheers) We're economically attacking the young, but I know, let's attack their emotional\nand mental well-being. Let's take advantage\nof the flaws in our species with medieval institutions,\nPaleolithic instincts and godlike technology. I'm just going to say, I think Mark Zuckerberg has done more\ndamage to the young people in our nation while making more money\nthan any person in history. (Applause) Oh, but wait, it could be worse. It's as if we let an adversary implant\na neural jack into our youth to raise a generation of civic, military and business leaders that hate America. How can we be this stupid? (Laughter) This all adds up to a bunch of graphs\nall headed up into the right. And what are they? What's the first one? Oh, that's self-harm rates,\nwhich have exploded, especially among girls since my colleague\nJonathan Haidt pointed out, it's really, really gone crazy\nsince social went on mobile. What's the next one? Teens with depression. The next one, men and women\nnot having sex. Biggest fear of my parents was that I was\ngoing to get in too much trouble. My biggest fear, honestly, is that my kids aren't going\nto get into enough trouble. My advice to every young person\nwatching this program is go out, drink more\nand make a series of bad decisions that might pay off. (Laughter and applause) Next graph, cumulative gun deaths. You're more likely to be shot\nin the United States if you're a toddler\nor an infant than a cop. Next graph, obesity, way up. By the way, the industrial food complex\nwants to addict you to shitty, fatty foods so they can hand you over\nto the industrial diabetes complex. We should not romanticize obesity. You're not finding your fucking truth. You're finding diabetes. (Laughter and applause) Overdose deaths, way up. Deaths of despair. When I was in high school,\nit was drunk driving, now it's kids killing themselves. Young people don't want\nto have kids anymore. Two-thirds of people\naged 30 to 34, able-bodied, used to decide to have at least one child. It's been cut in half. It's now less than a third, 27 percent. As a result, people over the age of 60\nin the US, pretty happy. People under the age of 30, not so much. Some of the lowest in the free world. What can we do? Nothing wrong with America that can't\nbe fixed with what's right with it. We got the hard stuff figured out. There are programs to address\nall of these issues, they cost a lot of money,\nthat's the hard part. And we have figured this out. In just five minutes\npost an earnings call, we can add a quarter\nof a trillion dollars to the economy. We've got the hard part\nfigured out, the resources. We have the money,\nbut we decide not to do it. This is per-capita spending\non child care in the United States relative to other nations. This is housing permits. Things are doable. We increase minimum wage\nat 25 bucks an hour, it goes into the economy. The wonderful things about low-\nand middle-income households is they spend all their money. We have to have or restore\na progressive tax structure with alternative minimum tax\non corporations and wealthy individuals. We need to refund the IRS. We need to reform Social Security. It should be based on whether\nyou need the money, not on how old you are. We need a negative income tax. My friend Andrew Yang\nscrewed up a great idea, but he branded it incorrectly. Instead of calling it UBI, he should’ve got Republicans on board\nby calling it a negative income tax. (Laughter) We need to eliminate\nthe capital gains tax deduction. When did we decide\nthat the money that capital earns is more noble than the money\nthat sweat earns? Shouldn't it be flipped? (Applause) We need to remove 230 protection\nfor all algorithmically-elevated content. We need identity verification. The reason we can have\nidentity verification is because we have a First Amendment. Break up Big Tech. We have monopolies that are incurring\ngreater and greater costs on every small business and parents\nbecause again, see above, our representatives don't\nunderstand these technologies. We need to age-gate social media. There's absolutely no reason\nanyone under the age of 16 should ever be on social media. (Applause) We need universal pre-K. We need to reinstate\nthe expanded child-tax credit. We need term limits,\nsee above, Andrew Yang. We need income-based affirmative action. Any visible signs of affirmative\naction make no sense at all. You would rather be born gay or non-white, in the United States today than poor. And that's a sign of our progress and our need to recalibrate\nwho we give advantage to. Affirmative action,\nof which I’m a beneficiary -- I got Pell Grants,\nI got unfair advantage -- affirmative action is a wonderful thing,\nand it should be based on color: it should be based on green. How much money you have or don't have. Expand college enrollment\nin vocational programs. Mental health, ban phones in schools,\ninvest in third places, Big Brothers and Sisters programs. We need national service. We need to tell people\nin the United States and Canada that they live in the greatest\ncountries in the world, and we need to remind them\nof that every day by exposing them to other great Americans\nwhere they feel connective tissue. We can do all of this. We can do all of it. We have the resources. The question is, do we have the will? This is my last slide. It is an emotionally manipulative slide\nto try and get you to like me more. (Laughter) But it does have a message. This is the whole shooting match. Anybody here without kids,\nask someone with kids. You have your world of work, you have your world of friends,\nyou have your world of kids. Something happens here, your whole\nworld shrinks to this. (Applause) So I present, as I wrap here,\nwith just a few questions. One, if you acknowledge that our kids\nare the most important thing in our lives, that everything else\nwe do here is meaningful, but our kids' well-being\nand prosperity is profound. If you acknowledge\nthat they're doing more poorly than previous generations. If you believe there’s a chance that the illusion of complexity\nhas done nothing but provide cloud cover for the unbelievable\ntransfer of good will, of well-being and of prosperity\nfrom young to old. And if you believe we can\nactually fix these problems and we have the resources, then I present to you, I posit, I augur the question that I hope\nhas more veracity than it did 17 minutes\nand 24 seconds ago. And that's the following question. Do we love our children? My name is Scott Galloway, I teach at NYU,\nand I appreciate your time. (Cheers and applause) Thank you.

Eichmann had been a Nazi official\ntasked with organizing the transport of over 1.5 million European Jews\nto ghettos and concentration camps. He was popularly described\nas an evil mastermind who orchestrated atrocities\nfrom a cushy German office, and many were eager to see the so-called\n“desk murderer” tried for his crimes. But the squeamish man who took the stand\nseemed more like a dull bureaucrat than a sadistic killer. The disparity between Eichmann’s nature\nand his actions was unsettling for many viewers, but for philosopher Hannah Arendt, this contradiction inspired\na disturbing revelation. Arendt was a German Jew who fled\nher homeland in 1933 after being briefly imprisoned\nby the German secret police. As a refugee in France\nand then the United States, she dedicated herself to understanding\nhow the Nazi regime came to power, and more specifically,\nhow it inspired so many atrocities. A common opinion at the time was that\nthe Third Reich was a historical oddity; a perfect storm of uniquely evil leaders supported by German citizens\nlooking for revenge after their defeat in World War I. But Arendt believed the true conditions\nbehind this unprecedented rise of totalitarianism\nweren’t specific to Germany. Throughout the 1950s, Arendt developed\na theory of the human condition that divided life into three facets: labor— in which we satisfy\nour material needs and desires; work— in which we build the world’s\nphysical and cultural infrastructure; and action— in which we publicly\narticulate our values to collectively shape the world around us. It was this last facet,\nthe life of action, that Arendt believed was under attack, both in Germany and many other\nindustrialized societies. She saw modernity as an age\nruled by labor, where individuals mainly appear\nin the social world to produce and consume goods and services rather than share ideas\nand shape communities. Arendt believed this had fostered\nsocieties and ideologies where individuals were seen only\nfor their economic value, rather than their moral\nand political capacities. She believed this isolated people from\ntheir neighbors and their sense of self. And in her 1951 book,\n“The Origins of Totalitarianism,” Arendt argued these conditions provided\nfertile ground for totalitarian regimes, which use fear and violence\nto increase isolation and make it dangerous to publicly engage\nas freethinking political agents. In this lonely state,\nparticipating in the regime becomes the only way to recover\na sense of identity and community. Arendt believed it was this\nkind of environment where Eichmann committed his crimes. Most people expected\nthe Jewish German philosopher to judge the ex-Nazi harshly. But while she condemned\nhis monstrous actions, Arendt saw no evidence that Eichmann\nhimself was uniquely evil. She saw him as a distinctly ordinary man\nwho considered diligent obedience the highest form of civic duty. And for Arendt, it was exactly this\nordinariness that was most terrifying. Her point wasn't just that anyone\ncould do what Eichmann did, but that his story suggested\nordinary people could willingly accept\ntheir societal role— even when it contributed to genocide. Arendt called this phenomenon\n“the banality of evil,” and warned that it can emerge whenever\nsociety inhibits our ability to think; or more specifically,\nto question our beliefs and actions in a self-reflective internal dialogue. Arendt believed this kind of thinking is\nthe only way to confront moral problems, and that our responsibility\nto self-reflect is especially important when independent thought is threatened. She acknowledged that critical thinking\nin oppressive spaces is a defiant act that requires\npersonal courage. But it must be done regardless, which is why Arendt still held\nEichmann accountable. This thread runs throughout Arendt's work, where she continually insisted\nthat thinking was our greatest weapon against the threats of modernity. Namely, a relentless drive for economic\nand technological development which would increase social alienation\nand inhibit human freedom. To foster this essential value, Arendt believed we need to create\nformal and informal forums that allowed for open conversations\nabout shaping our collective future. These might include townhall meetings,\nself-governing workplaces, or student unions. But whatever shape they take, what’s most important to Arendt\nis that they value open dialogue and critical self-reflection."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "For Arendt, action means ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Talking with other people"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Punishing wrongdoers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Publicly advocating for social and political change"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Turning up at public events"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What kind of activity dominates the modern age, according to Arendt?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "New forms of wrongdoing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Production and consumption"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The development of public infrastructure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Critical thinking"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does Arendt believe to be an essential condition for the rise of totalitarianism?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Self-hatred"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Apathy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Genocide"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Loneliness"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to Arendt’s diagnosis, what primarily made Eichmann capable of his crimes was his_______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Inability to think"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ambition for promotion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nazi ideology"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hatred for his victims"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Arendt believes that thinking is most important because it allows us to _________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Advance technological progress"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Halt technological progress"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Critique our beliefs and actions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Attain new knowledge"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Jacobus", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/if-you-re-an-adult-mayfly-you-ll-probably-die-before-the-end-of-this-video-luke-m-jacobus", "transcript": {"en": "Like so many winged insects, the world’s roughly 4,000 mayfly species\ntake to the skies for their annual reproductive ritual. These flights happen above every kind\nof freshwater body on Earth, barring Antarctica\nand a few remote islands. But whether the breeding mayflies\nare large Hexagenia limbata, tiny Paracloeodes minutus,\nor the thousands of species in between, their time on the wing will be brief. Very brief. For most mayflies,\nadulthood lasts roughly one day. And for some species,\nit’s only a matter of minutes. This isn’t because they’re all\neaten up by predators— though they are a favorite food\nof many fish, birds, and larger insects. Rather, this abridged adulthood is\na natural part of their life cycle. A close look at these insects reveals\nthey've ditched functional mouths and digestive systems. Without these innards taking up space,\nmayfly bodies can store more eggs, with some species producing\nup to 12,000 per individual. This adaptation is essential\nto mayfly survival since relatively few of these unborn flies\nare likely to reach adulthood, and even fewer will successfully\nreproduce themselves. In most of these flights,\nmale mayflies form dancing swarms, which female mayflies move\nthrough until a male grasps them for some mid-air mating. Some all-female populations can\nreproduce without joining in the dance, using a process called parthenogenesis\nto produce viable offspring without the help of a male. And recent research suggests some mayfly\npopulations may even switch back and forth between these two forms of reproduction. But regardless of how the eggs\nare made ready, the female will deposit them\non or under the water, and promptly perish. This might sound like a tragically\nbrief existence. And even mayflies’ scientific name, Ephemeroptera, refers to their\nstunningly short lifespan. But for centuries, fishermen suspected\nthat mayflies live much longer than this short flight. And in 1681, scientists finally caught\nup to their fishing friends with a published account\nof the full mayfly life cycle. When the time is right,\nthese eggs will hatch. Depending on the kind of mayfly, this can happen as late as several months\nafter the egg is laid, or even before it’s completely left\nthe mother’s body. But whenever their egg opens up, the mayfly inside quickly finds\nits way into fresh water, and it’s in this aquatic, nymph stage that mayflies spend\nthe majority of their lives. Inhabiting rivers, small streams,\nponds, lakes, and other places with clean fresh water, most mayfly species stay in this\nnymph stage and feed underwater for nearly an entire year. In fact, some species live as nymphs\nfor up to two years before they metamorphose\ninto their winged adult state. A year is a long time for such\na small creature to stay alive. So to survive and thrive, mayfly species\nhave a wide variety of habits and corresponding body forms. Sprawlers are flat enough to stick\nto surfaces despite the strength of a current, while clingers accomplish the same feat\nwith suckers and claws. Other species are swimmers,\ncrawlers, or borers. One of the most noticeable groups\nare the burrowing mayflies; sizable specimens which use\ntheir legs, tusks, and a scoop on their heads\nto dig U-shaped tunnels. In these muddy dwellings,\nthe nymphs use their abdominal gills to accelerate water through their burrow,\nfiltering it for food along the way. After they metamorphose,\nadult swarms can get so large they appear on weather radars like rain. Regardless of how they've adapted, each unique species plays\nan essential role in their ecosystem. Plus, nearly all mayflies are a staple\nof freshwater fish diets, and since they ingest the smallest\nparticulate matter in their environment, mayflies are also very sensitive\nto water pollution. In fact, scientists can tell a lot\nabout a water body’s health based on which mayfly species they find. If they don't find mayflies at all, it's usually an indication\nthat something is wrong. So the next time you see a swarm\nof mayflies over a pond, bridge, or park fountain, remember that their short aerial dance means a healthy world exists\nbelow the surface."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where are you most likely to find mayfly reproductive flights?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Near freshwater"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Near saltwater"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Over decomposing animal matter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Antarctica"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How long is the shortest adult lifespan for a mayfly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "About a year"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two weeks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Five days"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A few minutes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does the scientific name “Ephemeroptera” refer to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fishing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Short life"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Reproduction"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where do mayfly nymphs live?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Soil"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Freshwater"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Saltwater"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ice & snow"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Approximately how long does the nymph of most species spend in water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "About a year"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two weeks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A few minutes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No time, because they don’t live in water"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Can you imagine a milestone, a win,\nor even a material possession that would unlock this feeling? In this animated version of\nDavid Steindl-Rast’s popular TED Talk, Brother David explains how a simple\nadjustment in how you move through the world might just change\nwhat you see, how you feel, and how you act. Now my topic is gratefulness. What is the connection\nbetween happiness and gratefulness? Many people would say, well,\nthat’s very easy. When you are happy, you’re grateful. But think again. Is it really the happy people\nthat are grateful? We all know quite a number of people\nwho have everything that it would take to be happy, and they are not happy,\nbecause they want something else, or they want more of the same. And we all know people\nwho have lots of misfortune, misfortune that we ourselves\nwould not want to have, and they are deeply happy. They radiate happiness. You are surprised. Why? Because they are grateful. Now, we can ask, what really do we mean \nby gratefulness? And how does it work? Something’s given to us\nthat’s valuable to us. And it’s really given. These two things have to come together. It has to be something valuable,\nand it's a real gift. And when these two things come together, then gratefulness spontaneously\nrises in my heart, happiness spontaneously rises in my heart. That’s how gratefulness happens. Now, the key to all this is that we cannot only experience this\nonce in a while. We can be people who live gratefully. And how can we live gratefully? By experiencing, by becoming aware that every moment\nis a given moment, as we say. It’s a gift. You have no way of assuring that there\nwill be another moment given to you, and yet, that’s the most valuable thing\nthat can ever be given to us, this moment,\nwith all the opportunity that it contains. Does that mean that we can be grateful\nfor everything? Certainly not. We cannot be grateful for violence,\nfor war, for oppression, for exploitation. On the personal level, we cannot be grateful for the loss\nof a friend, for unfaithfulness, for bereavement. But I didn’t say we can be grateful\nfor everything. I said we can be grateful in every\ngiven moment for the opportunity, and even when we are confronted\nwith something that is terribly difficult, we can rise to this occasion and respond to the opportunity\nthat is given to us. So how can each one of us find\na method for living gratefully, not just once in a while being grateful,\nbut moment by moment to be grateful? How can we do it? It’s a very simple method:\nStop. Look. Go. That’s all. But how often do we stop? We rush through life; we don’t stop. We miss the opportunity\nbecause we don’t stop. We have to stop. We have to get quiet. And we have to build stop signs\ninto our lives. And when you stop, then the next thing\nis to look. You look. You open your eyes.\nYou open your ears. You open your nose. You open all your senses for this\nwonderful richness that is given to us. There is no end to it,\nand that is what life is all about, to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us. And then we can also open our hearts,\nour hearts for the opportunities, for the opportunities also to help others,\nto make others happy, because nothing makes us more happy\nthan when all of us are happy. And when we open our hearts\nto the opportunities, the opportunities invite us\nto do something, and that is the third. Stop, look, and then go,\nand really do something. And what we can do is whatever life offers\nto you in that present moment. There is a wave of gratefulness because people are becoming aware\nhow important this is and how this can change our world, because if you’re grateful,\nyou’re not fearful. If you're not fearful, you're not violent. If you’re grateful, you act\nout of a sense of enough and not of a sense of scarcity,\nand you’re willing to share. If you're grateful, you are enjoying\nthe differences between people and you are respectful to everybody. And that changes this power pyramid\nunder which we live.

But you probably already own a mask\nthat uses remarkably similar technology. And in the near future, we may\nneed to rely on these filters as part of our everyday lives. In addition to emerging diseases, wildfire frequency has more than tripled\nfrom 1996 to 2021. As fires burn longer and cover more land,\ntheir smoke affects more people each year. Climate change is also causing\nmore hot, sunny days, which accelerates the production\nof toxic ground level ozone. So, how do these masks work, and can they protect us from new\nand old airborne threats? Well, the first rule of filters is\nmaking sure you have a tight seal. Without that, even the best mask\nin the world is useless. So assuming your mask is on tight, this technology can capture pollutants\nin one of two ways: filtering them out by size or\nattracting specific chemical compounds. For an example of the first approach,\nlet’s look at wildfire smoke. When forests burn, they generate\na wide variety of chemicals. At close range, there are so many\ndifferent pollutants at such high concentrations\nthat no filter could help you— this is why firefighters travel\nwith their own air supply. But further away,\nthe situation is different. While there's still a range of chemicals, they’ve mostly aggregated into tiny solid\nor liquid particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter. This particulate matter is much of what\nyou're seeing and smelling in smoke, and it's especially dangerous\nfor children, the elderly, and those with respiratory\nor cardiovascular diseases. Luckily, the majority of these\nparticulates are still large enough to be captured by the most basic filters, which are made of polypropylene \nor glass strands roughly 1/10 the width of a human hair. Under a microscope,\nthey look like a thick forest, and at this scale, these branches\nhave a special property. Typically, when you use a sieve, you’re filtering out objects\nlarger than the sieve’s holes. But these polypropylene branches\ncan catch particles much smaller than the gaps between them. That’s because, when a particle\ncollides with a thread, van der Waals forces cause it to stick\nas if it were made of Velcro. Plus, size-based filters can use\nelectrically charged fibers that attract particles not already\non a collision course. This is how even a simple N95 mask can\ncatch at least 95% of particulate matter. And why an N100 mask or an air purifier with a high efficiency\nparticulate air filter can catch at least 99.97% of particulates. With a tight seal, this level of protection will\nfilter out most airborne pollution. Unfortunately, some pollutants are still\ntoo small for this approach, including ozone molecules. These are barely bigger than the oxygen\nthat we need to breathe and exposure is associated with asthma,\nrespiratory conditions, and even premature death. Our best chance to filter them\nare activated carbon masks. At the microscopic level, activated carbon\nlooks like a vast black honeycomb, and it's highly microporous structure\ncan trap tiny ozone molecules. But this material still needs help\nto capture other pollutants like hydrogen sulfide, chlorine,\nand ammonia. For these threats, we need to combine\nthe activated carbon with some simple chemistry. If the pollutant is acidic, we can infuse\nthe filter with a basic chemical. Then when the two meet, they react,\nand the gas is trapped. Similarly, we can use acids\nto trap basic pollutants. Even with the right mask, it's still smart\nto check air quality indicators and to stay indoors\nwhen the threat level is high. And just like a mask, you'll want to make\nsure your house is well sealed. You can do this by closing windows,\nturning off fans that vent outside, and using HEPA filter equipped\nair purifiers or their cheaper, DIY cousin,\nthe Corsi-Rosenthal box. Following these guidelines can help\nus breathe easy as we work on preventing these pollutants\nin the first place."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How has the frequency of wildfires changed from 1996 to 2021 according to the video?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It has decreased significantly."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It has doubled."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It has remained the same."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It has more than tripled."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What makes wildfire smoke particularly dangerous for children and the elderly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The color of the smoke"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The high temperature of the smoke"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The particulate matter in the smoke"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The smell of the smoke"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How does an N95 mask function to filter particulate matter?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By using water to trap particles"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By electrically charged fibers attracting particles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By using a magnetic field to capture particles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By heating the air to remove particles"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What type of mask is needed to filter out tiny ozone molecules effectively?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "N100 mask"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Activated carbon mask"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Simple cloth mask"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Surgical mask"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is recommended to improve air quality indoors during high pollution days?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Open windows to circulate air"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Use fans that vent outside."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Use air purifiers equipped with a HEPA filter."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Increase indoor humidity"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Yet, until we collectively\ndemand accountability, the incentives to fund it will not exist. The first time I spoke at a conference\nwas here at TED, eight years ago. Fresh out of grad school,\nlittle did I know that in those few minutes onstage, I was framing the questions\nI was going to be asked for the next decade. And, like too many 20-somethings, I expected to solve\nthe world's problems -- more specifically,\nthe world's water problems -- with my technology. I had a lot to learn. It was seductive, believing that our biggest\nwater quality problems persist because they're so hard to identify. And I presumed that we just needed simpler, faster\nand more affordable sensors. I was wrong. While it's true that\nmanaging tomorrow's water risk is going to require better data\nand more technology, today we're barely using\nthe little water data that we have. Our biggest water problems persist\nbecause of what we don't do and the problems we fail to acknowledge. There's actually little question about what today's water data\nis telling us to do as a species: we need to conserve more, and we need to pollute less. But today's data is not going to help us\nforecast the emerging risks facing businesses and markets. It's rapidly becoming useless for that. It used to carry more value, but it's never actually told us\nwith any real accuracy how much water we have or what's in it. Let's consider the past decade\nof water usage statistics from each of the G20 nations. Now, what these numbers do not tell you is that none of these countries\ndirectly measures how much water they use. These are all estimates, and they're based on outdated models that don't consider the climate crisis, nor do they consider its impact on water. In 2015, Chennai,\nIndia's sixth-largest city, was hit with the worst floods\nit had seen in a century. Today, its water reservoirs\nare nearly dry. It took three years to get here, three years of subaverage rainfall. Now, that's faster than most nations\ntabulate their national water data, including the US. And although there were forecasts that predicted severe shortages\nof water in Chennai, none of them could actually help us\npinpoint exactly when or where this was going to happen. This is a new type of water problem, because the rate at which\nevery aspect of our water cycle changes is accelerating. As a recent UN warning\nthis month revealed, we are now facing one new\nclimate emergency every single week. There are greater uncertainties\nahead for water quality. It's rare in most countries\nfor most water bodies to be tested for more than a handful\nof contaminants in a year. Instead of testing, we use\nwhat's called the \"dilution model\" to manage pollution. Now, imagine I took\nan Olympic-sized swimming pool, I filled it with fresh water\nand I added one drop of mercury. That would dilute down\nto one part per billion mercury, which is well within what\nthe World Health Organization considers safe. But if there was any unforeseen drop\nin how much water was available -- less groundwater, less stream flow,\nless water in the pool -- less dilution would take place, and things would get more toxic. So this is how most countries\nare managing pollution. They use this model to tell them\nhow much pollution is safe. And it has clear weaknesses, but it worked well enough\nwhen we had abundant water and consistent weather patterns. Now that we don't, we're going to need\nto invest and develop new data-collection strategies. But before we do that, we have to start\nacting on the data we already have. This is a jet fuel fire. As many of you may be aware, jet fuel emissions play\nan enormous role in climate change. What you might not be aware of\nis that the US Department of Defense is the world's largest\nconsumer of jet fuel. And when they consume jet fuel, they mandate the use\nof the firefighting foam pictured here, which contains a class\nof chemicals called PFAS. Nobody uses more of this foam\nthan the US Department of Defense, and every time it's used, PFAS\nfinds its way into our water systems. Globally, militaries have been using\nthis foam since the 1970s. We know PFAS causes cancer, birth defects, and it's now so pervasive\nin the environment that we seem to find it in nearly\nevery living thing we test, including us. But so far, the US Department of Defense\nhas not been held accountable for PFAS contamination, nor has it been held liable. And although there's an effort underway\nto phase out these firefighting foams, they're not embracing safer,\neffective alternatives. They're actually using\nother PFAS molecules, which may, for all we know,\ncarry worse health consequences. So today, government accountability\nis eroding to the point of elimination, and the risk of liability\nfrom water pollution is vanishing. What types of incentives does this create\nfor investing in our water future? Over the past decade, the average\nearly stage global investment in early stage water technology companies has totaled less than\n30 million dollars every year. That's 0.12 percent of global\nventure capital for early stage companies. And public spending is not going up\nnearly fast enough. And a closer look at it reveals\nthat water is not a priority. In 2014, the US federal government\nwas spending 11 dollars per citizen on water infrastructure, versus 251 dollars on IT infrastructure. So when we don't use the data we have, we don't encourage investment\nin new technologies, we don't encourage more data collection and we certainly don't encourage\ninvestment in securing a water future. So are we doomed? Part of what I'm still learning is how to balance the doom\nand the urgency with things we can do, because Greta Thunberg\nand the Extinction Rebellion don't want our hope --\nthey want us to act. So what can we do? It's hard to imagine life\nwithout a weather service, but before modern weather forecasting, we had no commercial air travel, it was common for ships to be lost at sea, and a single storm could produce\na food shortage. Once we had radio and telegraph networks, all that was necessary\nto solve these problems was tracking the movement of storms. And that laid the foundation\nfor a global data collection effort, one that every household\nand every business depends upon today. And this was as much the result of\ncoordinated and consistent data collection as it was the result of producing\na culture that saw greater value in openly assessing and sharing everything\nthat it could find out and discover about the risks we face. A global weather service for water\nwould help us forecast water shortages. It could help us implement rationing\nwell before reservoirs run dry. It could help us detect\ncontamination before it spreads. It could protect our supply chains, secure our food supplies, and, perhaps most importantly, it would enable\nthe precise estimation of risk necessary to insure against it. We know we can do this because\nwe've already done it with weather. But it's going to require resources. We need to encourage\ngreater investment in water. Investors, venture capitalists: a portion of your funds and portfolios\nshould be dedicated to water. Nothing is more valuable and, after all, businesses are going\nto need to understand water risks in order to remain competitive\nin the world we are entering. Aside from venture capital, there are also lots of promising\ngovernment programs that encourage economic development\nthrough tax incentives. A new option in the US\nthat my company is using is called \"opportunity zones.\" They offer favorable tax treatment\nfor investing capital gains in designated distressed\nand low-income areas. Now, these are areas that are also facing\nstaggering water risk, so this creates crucial incentives\nto work directly with the communities who need help most. And if you're not looking\nto make this type of investment but you own land in the US, did you know that\nyou can leverage your land to conserve water quality permanently with a conservation easement? You can assign the perpetual right\nto a local land trust to conserve your land and set specific water quality goals. And if you meet those goals, you can be rewarded with\na substantial tax discount every year. How many areas could\nour global community protect through these and other programs? They're powerful because they offer\nthe access to real property necessary to lay the foundation\nfor a global weather service for water. But this can only work if we use\nthese programs as they are intended and not as mere vehicles for tax evasion. When the conservation easement\nwas established, nobody could anticipate how ingrained\nin environmental movements corporate polluters would become. And we've become accustomed to companies\ntalking about the climate crisis while doing nothing about it. This has undermined the legacy\nand the impact of these programs, but it also makes them\nripe for reclamation. Why not use conservation easements\nas they were intended, to set and reach\nambitious conservation goals? Why not create opportunities\nin opportunity zones? Because fundamentally,\nwater security requires accountability. Accountability is not corporate polluters\nsponsoring environmental groups and museums. Those are conflicts of interest. (Applause) Accountability is: making the risk of liability too expensive to continue polluting\nand wasting our water. We can't keep settling for words.\nIt's time to act. And where better to start\nthan with our biggest polluters, particularly the US Department\nof Defense, which is taxpayer-funded. Who and what are we protecting\nwhen US soldiers, their families and the people who live near\nUS military bases abroad are all drinking toxic water? Global security can no longer remain\nat odds with protecting our planet or our collective health. Our survival depends on it. Similarly, agriculture in most countries\ndepends on taxpayer-funded subsidies that are paid to farmers to secure\nand stabilize food supplies. These incentives are\na crucial leverage point for us, because agriculture is responsible\nfor consuming 70 percent of all the water we use every year. Fertilizer and pesticide runoff are the two biggest sources\nof water pollution. Let's restructure these subsidies\nto demand better water efficiency and less pollution. (Applause) Finally: we can't expect progress if we're unwilling to confront\nthe conflicts of interest that suppress science, that undermine innovation and that discourage transparency. It is in the public interest to measure and to share everything\nwe can learn and discover about the risks we face in water. Reality does not exist\nuntil it's measured. It doesn't just take\ntechnology to measure it. It takes our collective will. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Braswell", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-maya-empire-s-most-powerful-city-geoffrey-e-braswell", "transcript": {"en": "During an important calendrical\ncelebration in 889 CE, Lord K’ak’ Upakal may have sat\natop his ornate palace and observed the bustling hub\nhe’d helped Chichen Itza become. The Maya city’s golden age would outlast\nK’ak’ Upakal’s own life, but he couldn’t have known\nthe crises that lay ahead. A century before, warfare and failing\nagriculture forced Maya people to abandon numerous\nCentral American settlements. This shifted the center\nof their civilization north, to hotter, drier Yucatan. During the early 800s, cities like Chichen Itza, Izamal,\nand Uxmal expanded. But Yucatan presented its own challenges. Surface water was scarce and the region’s limestone bedrock\nrapidly absorbed rain. This forced many Yucatecan cities\nto collect rainwater in cisterns. But the land surrounding Chichen Itza\nis pocked with sinkholes, where collapsed bedrock reveals an\nabundant supply of fresh groundwater. Because of this freshwater access, when\ndrought seized Yucatan in the early 900s, Chichen Itza survived to become\nthe most powerful Maya city. People immigrated from hundreds\nof kilometers away, and, at its height, Chichen Itza’s\npopulation possibly reached 50,000. The city came to reflect a diverse\ninternational culture in all spheres of life. Its challenge then became sustaining\na large population in an unpredictable environment. During the 10th century,\nfollowing K’ak’ Upakal’s death, Chichen Itza’s government shifted\nfrom a focus solely on the king to a more flexible system that also included ruling councils\nof the city’s elite. Unlike traditional Maya kings, who reinforced their legitimacy with\ndestructive wars and costly monuments, the new rulers focused largely\non economic growth. They channeled the city’s military might\ninto establishing long-distance trade and political dominance. Merchant-warriors traveled from\ncoastal ports and captured valuable goods. Using obsidian, gold, copper,\nturquoise, and jade from various parts\nof Central and North America, Chichen Itza’s inhabitants crafted\nsharp tools and precious ornaments. They traded food, textiles, feathers,\nminerals, and metals, sometimes using cacao beans as currency. And they transported seafood\nfrom the coast to supplement the city’s locally grown\nstaple crops. Farming was essential\nto Chichen Itza’s survival. The city’s architecture and religious\npractices reflected this importance by keeping track of time,\nthe transit of celestial bodies, and agricultural cycles. As the city grew, its citizens built\na vast platform to support new temples, pyramids, altars,\nballcourts, and colonnades. Builders carefully aligned a round temple\nto mark solstices, equinoxes, and the passing of the planet Venus, an avatar of K’uk’ulkan,\nthe feathered serpent god. K’uk’ulkan became Chichen Itza’s\ncentral deity, and his worship transformed the city\ninto a center of religious pilgrimage. Architects designed a stepped pyramid\nand temple dedicated to K’uk’ulkan that towers 30 meters high, and features four stairs\nwith a total of 365 steps, each representing a day in the solar year. It’s oriented so that,\naround each equinox, the setting sun creates snake-like shadows\nthat slither down the balustrades, evoking the serpent god. Several buildings feature representations\nof Flower Mountain, the sacred paradise realm inhabited\nby gods and ancestors. And rulers from far and wide were inaugurated\nat Chichen Itza’s Great Ballcourt under the auspices of K’uk’ulkan and in the presence\nof thousands of spectators. However, Chichen Itza’s\ngolden age wouldn’t last forever. Around 1020 CE, an intense drought hit\nand lasted nearly a century. In an effort to end the disaster, people made offerings to rain deities\nin nearby caves and sinkholes, which were seen as entrances to the\nwatery underworld realm of the gods. Despite Chichen Itza’s natural advantages\nand the ingenuity of its people, the city couldn't support itself\nthrough this extended drought. Population plummeted\nduring the 11th century, and many people resettled on the coast. At the end of the drought, the new city of Mayapan emerged and replaced Chichen Itza\nas the principal city of Yucatan. Yet, Chichen Itza was never fully\nabandoned or forgotten. When the Spanish arrived centuries later, it was still a small, local capital\nof a Maya province. Chichen Itza’s original name\nwas preserved, and its ancient stone constructions\nwere still standing, as they do to this day."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where did the ancient Maya live?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "South America"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Europe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mexico and Central America"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The ancient Maya city of Chichen Itza is famous for ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tall pyramids"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Carved sculpture with writing"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Astronomy and observing the Sun"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Maya of Chichen Itza lived ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One million years ago"}, {"label": "B", "text": "10,000 years ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In Atlantis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About 1000-1200 years ago"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What were the primary concerns of the Maya of Chichen Itza?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rainwater for drinking and for growing crops"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Worshiping the Christian god"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Waging wars for economic gain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Environmental pollution"}, {"label": "E", "text": "(a) and (c)"}, {"label": "F", "text": "(b) and (d) "}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The Maya of Chichen Itza ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Got their water from rain and collected it in cisterns"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Made iron and steel weapons   "}, {"label": "C", "text": "Had to cope with freezing conditions due to climate change"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Used metal only for ornaments and decoration"}, {"label": "E", "text": "(a) and (d)"}, {"label": "F", "text": "(a) and (b) "}], "correct_option": "E"}]}
{"page": 113, "lesson": 15, "title": "Does math have a major flaw? - Jacqueline Doan and Alex Kazachek", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/does-math-have-a-major-flaw-jacqueline-doan-and-alex-kazachek", "transcript": {"en": "Consider this mathematician, with her standard-issue infinitely sharp\nknife and a perfect ball. She frantically slices and distributes\nthe ball into an infinite number of boxes. She then recombines the parts\ninto five precise sections. Gently moving and rotating\nthese sections around, seemingly impossibly, she recombines them\nto form two identical, flawless, and complete copies\nof the original ball. This is a result known in mathematics\nas the Banach-Tarski paradox. The paradox here is not\nin the logic or the proof— which are, like the balls, flawless— but instead in the tension\nbetween mathematics and our own experience of reality. And in this tension lives some beautiful\nand fundamental truths about what mathematics actually is. We’ll come back to that in a moment,\nbut first, we need to examine the foundation\nof every mathematical system: axioms. Every mathematical system\nis built and advanced by using logic to reach new conclusions. But logic can’t be applied to nothing; we have to start with some basic\nstatements, called axioms, that we declare to be true,\nand make deductions from there. Often these match our intuition\nfor how the world works— for instance, that adding zero to a number\nhas no effect is an axiom. If the goal of mathematics is to build\na house, axioms form its foundation— the first thing that’s laid down,\nthat supports everything else. Where things get interesting is that\nby laying a slightly different foundation, you can get a vastly different\nbut equally sound structure. For example, when Euclid laid\nhis foundations for geometry, one of his axioms implied that given\na line and a point off the line, only one parallel line exists\ngoing through that point. But later mathematicians, wanting to see if geometry was\nstill possible without this axiom, produced spherical\nand hyperbolic geometry. Each valid, logically sound,\nand useful in different contexts. One axiom common in modern mathematics\nis the Axiom of Choice. It typically comes into play in proofs\nthat require choosing elements from sets— which we’ll grossly simplify\nto marbles in boxes. For our choices to be valid,\nthey need to be consistent, meaning if we approach a box,\nchoose a marble, and then go back in time and choose again,\nwe'd know how to find the same marble. If we have a finite number of boxes,\nthat’s easy. It’s even straightforward\nwhen there are infinite boxes if each contains a marble that’s readily\ndistinguishable from the others. It’s when there are infinite boxes\nwith indistinguishable marbles that we have trouble. But in these scenarios, the Axiom of Choice lets us summon\na mysterious omniscient chooser that will always select the same marbles— without us having to know anything\nabout how those choices are made. Our stab-happy mathematician,\nfollowing Banach and Tarski’s proof, reaches a step in constructing\nthe five sections where she has infinitely many boxes\nfilled with indistinguishable parts. So she needs the Axiom of Choice\nto make their construction possible. If the Axiom of Choice can lead\nto such a counterintuitive result, should we just reject it? Mathematicians today say no, because it’s load-bearing for a lot\nof important results in mathematics. Fields like measure theory\nand functional analysis, which are crucial\nfor statistics and physics, are built upon the Axiom of Choice. While it leads to some\nimpractical results, it also leads to extremely practical ones. Fortunately, just as Euclidean geometry\nexists alongside hyperbolic geometry, mathematics with the Axiom of Choice\ncoexists with mathematics without it. The question for many mathematicians\nisn’t whether the Axiom of Choice, or for that matter any given axiom,\nis right or not, but whether it’s right\nfor what you’re trying to do. The fate of the Banach-Tarski paradox\nlies in this choice. This is the freedom mathematics gives us. Not only is it a way to model\nour physical universe using the axioms we intuit\nfrom our daily experiences, but a way to venture into abstract\nmathematical universes and explore arcane geometries and laws\nunlike anything we can ever experience. If we ever meet aliens, axioms which seem\nabsurd and incomprehensible to us might be everyday common sense to them. To investigate, we might start by handing\nthem an infinitely sharp knife and a perfect ball, and see what they do."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are axioms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Logical statements taken to be true and used as the foundation for further logical reasoning."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Famous mathematical theorems that have been proven to be true."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Physical laws of the universe, which are supported by experimental evidence."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Is the Banach-Tarski paradox true or false?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True: Its proof is logically sound."}, {"label": "B", "text": "False: It is physically impossible!"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neither: Its truth depends on the underlying axiomatic system."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When is the Axiom of Choice necessary?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When wanting to provide a formula for a choice function."}, {"label": "B", "text": "To assume the existence of a choice function on an arbitrary collection of sets."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Whenever a choice function is used, even for a finite collection of sets."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Is the Axiom of Choice true or false?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True: Mathematicians have proved it, which is why it’s now used extensively in modern mathematics."}, {"label": "B", "text": "False: It leads to impossible results like the Banach-Tarski paradox, which is evidence it cannot be true."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Neither: Its truth and falsehood are both consistent with the standard axioms of modern mathematics.

{"page": 113, "lesson": 16, "title": "How to protect the oceans - Sylvia Earle", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/eGGtB2zk", "transcript": {"en": "Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean, no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it. It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden, but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us, and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost -- actually, we've taken, we've eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying, but it really should concern you. It does concern you, as well. I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls \"tomorrow's child,\" asking why we didn't do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time. I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe. And I hope, Jill, that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. (Laughter) Did I say that? I guess I did. For me, as a scientist, it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba. It's when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter. I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime. Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970, when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon. In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim. It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down. It's one of my favorite bathing suits. Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea. I led a five-year National Geographic expedition, the Sustainable Seas expeditions, using these little subs. They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it. And I'm living proof. Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea. I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system; and then he pointed to this and he said, \"Life support system.\" We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it. The poet Auden said, \"Thousands have lived without love; none without water.\" Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean. No blue, no green. If you think the ocean isn't important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system. I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said, \"There it is! The World Bank!\" That's where all the assets are! And we've been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment. With every drop of water you drink, every breath you take, you're connected to the sea. No matter where on Earth you live. Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea. Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there, mostly by microbes. The ocean drives climate and weather, stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry. Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain, sleet and snow, and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world, maybe in the universe. No water, no life; no blue, no green. Yet we have this idea, we humans, that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn't matter what we do to it. That may have been true 10,000 years ago, and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100, especially in the last 50, we've drawn down the assets, the air, the water, the wildlife that make our lives possible. New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature; the nature of what's happening, showing us our impact on the Earth. I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem. And fortunately, in our time, we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history. And with knowing comes caring. And with caring, there's hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us. But first we have to know. Three years ago, I met John Hanke, who's the head of Google Earth, and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously. But I asked him: \"When are you going to finish it? You did a great job with the land, the dirt. What about the water?\" Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers, with DOER Marine, with National Geographic, with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world, ones that we could enlist, to put the ocean in Google Earth. And as of just this week, last Monday, Google Earth is now whole. Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center, we can find the nearby aquarium, we can look at where we're sitting, and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean, and California's four national marine sanctuaries, and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands: not just the little bit that pokes through the surface, but also what's below. To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! -- right there, ha -- under the ocean, see what the whales see. We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands. We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales. These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater. There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. We can pick up and fly to the deepest place: seven miles down, the Mariana Trench, where only two people have ever been. Imagine that. It's only seven miles, but only two people have been there, 49 years ago. One-way trips are easy. We need new deep-diving submarines. How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration? We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains, and understand life in the deep sea. We can now go to the Arctic. Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole. An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century. That's bad news for the polar bears. That's bad news for us too. Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming, it's also changing ocean chemistry, making the sea more acidic. That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton. Also it's bad news for us. We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea. Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets, gear that continues to kill. We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system, and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife, all carbon-based units. Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup, undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle, the oxygen cycle, the water cycle -- our life support system. We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead. All of these parts are part of our life support system. We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more. Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system, leaving plumes of death in their path. The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi, or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail, whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost. For every pound that goes to market, more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds, may be thrown away as bycatch. This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea. This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000. The highest concentrations are in red. In my lifetime, imagine, 90 percent of the big fish have been killed. Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales are way down in numbers. But, there is good news. Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around. But business as usual means that in 50 years, there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone. Imagine the ocean without fish. Imagine what that means to our life support system. Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too, but the problems are more obvious, and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park, the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had. About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected: safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink, generating oxygen, protecting watersheds. And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea, National Marine Sanctuaries. That's another great idea. The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world, that have some kind of protection. And you can find them on Google Earth. The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them. In the last three years, for example, the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments. But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally. Protected areas do rebound, but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass, or 200-year-old orange roughy. We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens. Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life, will live not just as a list, a photograph, or a paragraph. With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever -- to search out hope spots, and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future. Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance, right now, to get it right. Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected, but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish. Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows. 97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected, but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing. It's true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble. The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth, filled with luminous creatures, living in dark waters that average two miles deep. They flash, and sparkle, and glow with their own living light. There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child. The next 10 years may be the most important, and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life. To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power. We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease. We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place. But, nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean. Our fate and the ocean's are one. We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. A global plan of action with a world conservation union, the IUCN, is underway to protect biodiversity, to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change, on the high seas and in coastal areas, wherever we can identify critical places. New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see. The goal is to protect biodiversity, to provide stability and resilience. We need deep-diving subs, new technologies to explore the ocean. We need, maybe, an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps. And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is. I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films, expeditions, the web, new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean, the blue heart of the planet. How much? Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent. You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect? Whatever it is, a fraction of one percent is not enough.

What does it look like? - Joseph Lacey", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/3-easy-steps-to-build-a-real-utopia-joseph-lacey", "transcript": {"en": "You and a group of strangers have been\ngathered to design a just society. And to ensure none of you rig the system\nto benefit yourself, you’ve all been placed\nunder a “veil of ignorance.” Under this veil, you’re blind to certain\ninformation about each other and yourselves. You don’t know your age or sex, your profession or natural talents,\nhow much wealth you have, or your religious\nor philosophical beliefs. So, according to political philosopher\nJohn Rawls, you should be motivated to consider\nwhat’s most fair for all your society's citizens. When Rawls published this\nthought experiment— known as “the original position”—\nin his 1971 opus “A Theory of Justice,” he was trying to identify principles\nto support a realistic utopia. This visionary society would ensure\neveryone had the resources and opportunities required\nto freely pursue their goals. Rawls was confident these principles could\nonly be realized in a democracy. But he felt existing social structures\nweren’t the right path forward. He believed free market philosophies\nand welfare capitalism led to unjust accumulations\nof wealth and power. And he saw models inspired by Marxism as extreme reactions\nto capitalism’s flaws, with unrealistic assumptions\nabout economies and human nature. So Rawls proposed a new kind of democracy. One where no person was considered\nless valuable than another and all citizens could live\naccording to their own wills. And while the details of this vision\ncan seem radical, Rawls believed that,\nunder the veil of ignorance, free and equal people would\nunanimously agree to his fair society. So, let’s play out this\nthought experiment. The first step in designing our society\nis deciding how to distribute what Rawls called primary goods. These include the basic liberties,\nopportunities, and wealth necessary for pursuing most goals. Rawls believed our justice-architects\nwould agree to an “equal scheme\nof basic liberties” for all, including freedom of speech and the freedom to associate\nwith whoever they choose. After all, without the freedom\nto pursue one's goals, resources like wealth\nand job opportunities lose their value. Citizens would also have equal political\nliberties to vote and run for office. Next, Rawls believes the architects\nwould establish what he calls “fair equality of opportunity.” This means society must be arranged\nso no one is unfairly deprived of the resources necessary to compete\nfor valued jobs and other positions. However, after agreeing upon equality\nof liberty and opportunity, Rawls believes our justice-architects\nwould see the benefits of allowing for some wealth inequalities. For example, greater profits\ncan incentivize innovation, productivity, and investment. But Rawls also believes our designers\nwould want to limit differences in wealth with what he calls\n“the difference principle.” This states that wealth inequalities\nare only acceptable when they benefit\nthe least advantaged citizens, making them better off than they’d be\nunder conditions of strict equality. These tenets form the foundation\nof Rawls’ just society, and he believed they could be achieved\nthrough what he called “property owning democracy.” This model would guarantee equal access\nto education and healthcare and rely on government regulation\nto ensure a just distribution of property and wealth. Rawls knew fully adopting this approach\nwould require major changes for existing democracies. But he believed his principles\ncould at least inspire some immediate improvements. For example, Rawls advocated for limits\non campaign spending and political contributions to reduce the influence\nof wealth on politics. He also endorsed policies\nfighting discrimination and generous social safety nets\nlike unemployment benefits to ensure a good situation\nfor the worst-off. Some philosophers have\ncritiqued Rawls’ work. Ronald Dworkin argues that\nthe difference principle unfairly tethers society’s progress\nto the status of the worst-off, even if they’re in that position\nbecause of their own choices. Meanwhile, Martha Nussbaum believes\nRawls’ thought experiment overlooks real-life particulars. For example, the special needs\nof a person with disabilities might not be satisfied by the\nstandard distribution of primary goods. And more generally, some argue the architects in Rawls’\nharmonious thought experiment are simply too different\nfrom the competing interests building real societies. But since its publication, this thought experiment has inspired\nsome very real consequences. Rawls’ rallying cry for social\nand political equality and a more justly regulated form\nof capitalism has impacted countless political\nphilosophers, activists, and policymakers. And this new school of thought about\njustice continues to challenge people to look past their biases and consider\nwhat a fair society might truly look like."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following best describes the function of the \"veil of ignorance\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It helps individuals to think more clearly about what will benefit them."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It removes any self-knowledge that could bias how individuals think about justice."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It removes individual's beliefs about how societies work so as not to put artificial limitations on how individuals think about justice."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It makes individuals more caring towards each other."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why does Rawls think that the first principle of justice should be about securing an 'equal scheme of basic liberties for all'?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because he thinks freedom is more important than equality."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because he thinks that freedom is the central value in most modern democratic constitutions."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because he thinks that resources like opportunities and wealth are most valuable to us when we have the freedom to pursue them as we would like."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because he thinks justice and freedom are equivalent concepts."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What best describes Rawls's view on wealth inequalities?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are only justified when there are differences in how hard people work."}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are only justified when they increase the overall wealth of the society."}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are only justified when they are to the benefit of the least advantaged."}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are only justified when they lead to an expanding middle class."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What best describes Rawls's idea of 'property owning democracy'?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A society where there is a fair distribution of property and wealth among all citizens."}, {"label": "B", "text": "A society where only the more productive members of society should be entitled to own property."}, {"label": "C", "text": "A society where everyone owns the same amount of property."}, {"label": "D", "text": "A society where democratic rights are dependent on property ownership."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a standard critique of Rawls's 'original position'?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It does a poor job of challenging our biases about justice."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It does not sufficiently take account of what justice might look like for those with disabilities."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is too abstracted from the real world conflicts over questions of justice."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is too concerned for the worst off, some of whom may have responsibility for their position in society."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Adolf Hitler was dead,\nGerman surrender was imminent, and Allied troops had already begun\ndivvying up German territory. But high-ranking Nazi engineer\nWernher von Braun wasn’t worried. In fact, he approached\nthe US government directly— informing them of his location\nand waiting calmly for their arrival. As the brain behind the world’s first\nlong-range ballistic missile, von Braun knew his expertise made him\na highly valuable military asset. And sure enough, his so-called captors\ngave him a decidedly warm welcome. Von Braun wasn't the only Nazi scientist\nreceiving this treatment. While World War II was almost over,\na new war was brewing. And the US was eager to recruit\nthe smartest minds in Germany before the Soviets got the chance. This became known as Operation Paperclip— a clandestine campaign that brought\nover 1,500 German scientists to the US between 1945 and 1962. The program was named for the paperclips\nattached to the files of early recruits— indicating that incriminating information\nlike Nazi affiliations or suspected war crimes\ncould be disregarded. Von Braun, for example,\nhad overseen an SS project that relied on forced labor from thousands\nof concentration camp prisoners. While von Braun approached\nthe US directly, other scientists had to be\nidentified and located. One important asset in this effort was a Nazi-compiled list\nof Germany’s top scientists, which someone had unsuccessfully tried\nto dispose of by flushing down a toilet. But the US was just one player\nin this scramble. The Soviets were also competing\nto seize German brainpower, resorting to bribery\nand forced relocation. The French and British lacked the money\nto lure the best German brains, but that didn't stop them from kidnapping\nthe occasional scientist. They also stole patents and dismantled\nfactories to learn what they could. The US approach, however, featured\na different and particularly tempting brand of coercion: the promise to relocate entire German\nfamilies and grant them citizenship. This controversial offer\nwas one of the reasons Paperclip was initially shrouded\nin secrecy. But the project became difficult to hide\nwhen Germans started popping up all over the US. The military tried to get\nahead of any controversy by revealing the operation to the press\nin late 1946. But the news immediately attracted\ncriticism from many prominent voices, including Albert Einstein,\nEleanor Roosevelt, and the NAACP, as well as many veteran’s organizations. These parties opposed granting\nGerman scientists citizenship while millions of displaced persons,\nincluding survivors of Nazi atrocities, had no chance of coming to America. Most Americans were also against employing\nformer Nazis in sensitive national security positions. But as the Cold War ramped up, the military argument for keeping these\nscientists out of Soviet hands overpowered popular objections. With his Nazi past largely hidden\nfrom the public, von Braun became one of the US’s\nmost important engineers at the height of the Space Race. In 1958, his team responded\nto the Soviet launch of Sputnik with the US’s own successful\nsatellite launch. And in the 60s, he was the chief architect\nof Saturn V, the rocket that brought Americans\nto the moon. Other Paperclip recruits contributed\nto the development of chemical weapons such as Agent Orange,\npharmaceutical research, and the development of modern airplanes. These contributions helped the US\ngovernment present Paperclip as a success. But, in hindsight, it’s hard to gauge\nhow helpful the program really was. While von Braun saved the US years\nof rocketry experimentation, there's no reason to think American\nscientists couldn't have developed the same technology without him. Furthermore, very few Paperclippers\nwere as exceptional as von Braun. Many were average scientists\nwho either completed their contracts and returned to Germany, or took jobs alongside Americans\nwith equivalent expertise. But ultimately,\nthe issue of Paperclip’s success is just one of many questions raised\nby its contentious approach to science, ethics, and national security. Can scientists working on military\ntechnology be apolitical, or are they responsible\nfor their creations? Can pressing political and military\nconcerns justify overlooking war crimes? In many ways, von Braun’s obituary\nsums up the operation’s murkiness: “A kind of Faustian shadow may be\ndiscerned in [...] the fascinating career of Wernher von Braun: a man so possessed\nof [...] intellectual hunger, that any accommodation may be justified.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how many German scientists came to the United States under Operation Paperclip?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "300"}, {"label": "B", "text": "500"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1,500"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What expertise did Wernher von Braun possess that made him valuable to the United States?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Jet aircraft"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ballistic missiles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Electric submarines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chemical weapons"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Each of the following individuals or organizations opposed Operation Paperclip EXCEPT ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "NAACP"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Albert Einstein"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Harry Truman"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eleanor Roosevelt"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which nation(s) competed with the United States for German scientists after World War II?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Britain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "France"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Soviet Union"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why was Operation Paperclip considered controversial?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The US offered scientists with Nazi backgrounds American citizenship."}, {"label": "B", "text": "German scientists were forced to work in miserable conditions."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Operation Paperclip was authorized without President Harry Truman’s knowledge."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Operation Paperclip was extremely expensive for the US government."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 113, "lesson": 19, "title": "How to prevent political corruption - Stephanie Honchell Smith", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-political-corruption-inevitable-stephanie-honchell-smith", "transcript": {"en": "On October 23, 2015, Mcebisi Jonas,\nSouth Africa’s deputy finance minister, faced a harrowing, yet enticing, decision. He had thought he was attending\na normal business meeting but ended up in the home\nof the powerful Gupta family, sitting with the Gupta brothers\nand the president, Jacob Zuma’s, son. Jonas was offered a promotion\nand $45 million. In return, he would be expected\nto use his position to advance the Gupta’s\nmany business interests. This included firing officials\nwho opposed the construction of new power plants, which were slated to run on fuel\nfrom Gupta-owned mines. The deal was simple—\nbut would Jonas accept? This kind of corruption in politics\nis nothing new. It plagued the ancient world— the “Arthasastra,”\nan Indian political treatise that dates back to the 3rd century BCE, lists 40 types of embezzlement alone. So, what exactly is corruption,\nand what can we do to combat it? Corruption is often defined as a misuse\nof a position of power for personal gain. For example, this could be a city clerk\naccepting bribes in exchange for issuing permits; or a mayor appointing a campaign donor\nto an influential position. But corruption isn’t limited\nto the political sphere; it can happen in schools, sports,\nbusinesses, or religious institutions. In ancient Greece,\nthe power-hungry Alcmaeonid family notoriously bribed the priestesses\nat Delphi to deliver false prophecies, like telling the Spartans\nthey should invade Athens. It may seem like all corruption\nis driven by greed, but individual motives are often complex. There can be economic drivers, like family pressure\non an underpaid civil servant who exaggerates his expenses\nto get more money back. This might not seem like a big problem,\nbut corruption can snowball. If anti-corruption laws aren’t enforced, or if loopholes are\ncontinuously exploited, a larger culture of corruption can emerge. For example, in 2009,\nnumerous British MPs were exposed for using taxpayer money\nto cover personal expenses, from home renovations to luxury purchases,\nand even having a moat cleaned. And corruption isn't always\ndirectly about money. In 2016, a Department of Justice\ninvestigation found widespread patterns of unconstitutional policing,\nabuse, and corruption within the Baltimore Police Department. In just one elite task force,\neight officers were convicted of crimes, including planting evidence\nand robbing citizens during traffic stops. Corruption like this causes people\nto lose faith in government and can deplete much needed resources. The more taxpayer money\nthat goes into people’s pockets, the less there is to spend on services\nthat benefit the community— like repairing roads, building schools,\nor providing healthcare. In the case of South Africa, the Gupta family plundered billions\nof dollars from the country’s funds through their wide-ranging\ncorruption schemes, devastating the nation's economy. In Baltimore, the police department cost\ntaxpayers more than $22 million in court settlements\nand gravely eroded public trust. So, how can we prevent corruption? While it’s important that laws set\na high price for corrupt behavior, punishment is only one piece\nof the puzzle. Transparency in terms of budget\nand paper trails and support for freedom of the press\nare hugely important. In Botswana, the government\nhas built public trust through their ongoing commitment\nto respond to corruption openly, quickly, and decisively. In Denmark, government ministers must\npublish monthly reports cataloging their spending\non entertainment, official travel,\nand any gifts they’ve received. As citizens, we can vote out those\nwho engage in corruption and question officials who push\nback against transparency measures. And we can stand up against corruption\nwhen we see it. In South Africa,\nJonas refused the Guptas’ offer, and despite threats against his life,\nspoke out, exposing a sprawling web of corruption\nthat toppled Zuma’s regime, and sent the Gupta family into exile. But it wasn’t just Jonas’ revelation\nthat mattered. Once the scale of corruption\nwas unearthed, everyday South Africans\ntook to the streets, insisting that “Zuma must fall.” By using our civic voices, we can fight back to ensure\nthat tax dollars don’t line pockets, but instead benefit everyone."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How is corruption defined?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "money laundering"}, {"label": "B", "text": "improper communication with employees or civil servants"}, {"label": "C", "text": "a misuse of position of power for personal gain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "giving positions of power to relatives"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What powerful family bribed the priestesses at Delphi for self-serving false prophecies?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the Ptolemaic family"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the Aenead family"}, {"label": "C", "text": "the Euryclid family"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the Alcmaeonid family"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following can help prevent corruption?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "harsh sentences for law violations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "transparency in government and freedom of the press"}, {"label": "C", "text": "grass roots organizations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "better funding for public schools"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are the long-term consequences of a culture of corruption?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "people lose faith in government"}, {"label": "B", "text": "societal resources are depleted"}, {"label": "C", "text": "economic devastation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In 2016, the Baltimore police department was found to have demonstrated patterns of", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "unconstitutional policing, abuse, and corruption"}, {"label": "B", "text": "nepotism and favorable hiring practices"}, {"label": "C", "text": "unfair raise structures for officers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "gerrymandering police districts"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
