He'd had his writing \nburned in public before, but this time, he'd gotten locked up\nunder royal order for an essay about a philosopher's\ndeath bed rejection of God. To free himself, Denis promised\nnever to write things like that again. So he got back to work \non something a little like that, only way worse, and much bigger. In 1745, publisher André le Breton\nhad hired Diderot to adapt the English cyclopedia, or a universal dictionary \nof arts and sciences for French subscribers. A broke writer, Diderot survived\nby translating, tutoring, and authoring sermons for priests, and a pornographic novel once. Le Breton paired him with co-editor\nJean le Rond d'Alembert, a math genius found \non a church doorstep as a baby. Technical dictionaries, \nlike the cyclopedia, weren't new, but no one had attempted one publication\ncovering all knowledge, so they did. The two men organized \nthe French Enlightenment's brightest stars to produce the first encyclopedia, or rational dictionary of the arts,\nsciences, and crafts. Assembling every essential fact\nand principle in, as it turned out, over 70,000 entries, 20,000,000 words in 35 volumes of text and illustrations created over three decades\nof researching, writing, arguging, smuggling, backstabbing, law-breaking, and alphabetizing. To organize the work, Diderot adapted Francis Bacon's\n\"Classification of Knowledge\" into a three-part system based \non the mind's approaches to reality: memory, reason, and imagination. He also emphasized the importance\nof commerce, technology, and crafts, poking around shops to study the tools\nand techniques of Parisian laborers. To spotlight a few of the nearly\n150 philosoph contributers, Jean Jacques Rousseau,\nDiderot's close friend, wrote much of the music section \nin three months, and was never reimbursed for copy fees. His entry on political economy holds ideas\nhe'd later develop further in \"The Social Contract.\" D'Alembert wrote \nthe famous preliminary discourse, a key statement \nof the French Enlightenment, championing independent \ninvestigative reasoning as the path to progress. Louis de Jaucourt wrote a quarter\nof the encyclopedia, 18,000 articles, 5,000,000 words, unpaid. Louis once spent 20 years writing a book\non anatomy, shipped it to Amsterdam \nto be published uncensored, and the ship sank. Voltaire contributed entries, among them history, elegance, and fire. Diderot's entries sometimes \nexhibit slight bias. In \"political authority,\" he dismantled\nthe divine right of kings. Under \"citizen,\" he argued a state was strongest \nwithout great disparity in wealth. Not surprising from the guy who wrote\npoetry about mankind strangling its kings with the entrails of a priest. So Diderot's masterpiece wasn't a hit\nwith the king or highest priest. Upon release of the first two volumes, Louie XV banned the whole thing\nbut enjoyed his own copy. Pope Clement XIII ordered it burned. It was \"dangerous,\" \"reprehensible,\" as well as \"written in French,\" and in \"the most seductive style.\" He declared readers excommunicated and wanted Diderot arrested on sight. But Diderot kept a step ahead\nof being shut down, smuggling proofs outside France\nfor publication, and getting help from allies\nin the French Regime, including the King's mistress,\nMadame de Pompadour, and the royal librarian and censor,\nMalesherbes, who tipped Diderot off to impending raids, and even hid Diderot's papers\nat his dad's house. Still, he faced years of difficulty. D'Alembert dropped out. Rousseau broke off his friendship\nover a line in a play. Worse yet, his publisher secretly\nedited some proofs to read less radically. The uncensored pages reappeared \nin Russia in 1933, long after Diderot had considered\nthe work finished and died at lunch. The encyclopedia he left behind\nis many things: a cornerstone of the Enlightenment, a testament \nto France's crisis of authority, evidence of popular opinions migration\nfrom pulpit and pew to cafe, salon, and press. It even has recipes. It's also irrepressibly human, as you can tell from Diderot's entry\nabout a plant named aguaxima.

{"page": 41, "lesson": 2, "title": "The science of skin color - Angela Koine Flynn", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-skin-color-angela-koine-flynn", "transcript": {"en": "When ultraviolet sunlight hits our skin, it affects each of us \na little differently. Depending on skin color, it will take\nonly minutes of exposure to turn one person beetroot-pink, while another requires hours to experience\nthe slightest change. So what's to account for that difference and how did our skin come to take on\nso many different hues to begin with? Whatever the color, our skin tells an epic tale \nof human intrepidness and adaptability, revealing its variance to be \na function of biology. It all centers around melanin, the pigment that gives \nskin and hair its color. This ingredient comes from skin cells\ncalled melanocytes and takes two basic forms. There's eumelanin, which gives rise\nto a range of brown skin tones, as well as black, brown, and blond hair, and pheomelanin, which causes the\nreddish browns of freckles and red hair. But humans weren't always like this. Our varying skin tones were formed\nby an evolutionary process driven by the Sun. In began some 50,000 years ago when our\nancestors migrated north from Africa and into Europe and Asia. These ancient humans lived between\nthe Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn, a region saturated \nby the Sun's UV-carrying rays. When skin is exposed to UV for long\nperiods of time, the UV light damages \nthe DNA within our cells, and skin starts to burn. If that damage is severe enough, the cells mutations can lead to melanoma, a deadly cancer that forms \nin the skin's melanocytes. Sunscreen as we know it today\ndidn't exist 50,000 years ago. So how did our ancestors cope \nwith this onslaught of UV? The key to survival lay \nin their own personal sunscreen manufactured beneath the skin: melanin. The type and amount \nof melanin in your skin determines whether you'll be more or less\nprotected from the sun. This comes down to the skin's response\nas sunlight strikes it. When it's exposed to UV light, that triggers special light-sensitive \nreceptors called rhodopsin, which stimulate the production of melanin\nto shield cells from damage. For light-skin people, that extra melanin\ndarkens their skin and produces a tan. Over the course of generations, humans living at \nthe Sun-saturated latitudes in Africa adapted to have a higher \nmelanin production threshold and more eumelanin, giving skin a darker tone. This built-in sun shield helped protect\nthem from melanoma, likely making them evolutionarily fitter and capable of passing this useful trait\non to new generations. But soon, some of our Sun-adapted\nancestors migrated northward out of the tropical zone, spreading far and wide across the Earth. The further north they traveled,\nthe less direct sunshine they saw. This was a problem because \nalthough UV light can damage skin, it also has an important parallel benefit. UV helps our bodies produce vitamin D, an ingredient that strengthens bones\nand lets us absorb vital minerals, like calcium, iron, magnesium, \nphosphate, and zinc. Without it, humans experience serious\nfatigue and weakened bones that can cause a condition \nknown as rickets. For humans whose dark skin effectively\nblocked whatever sunlight there was, vitamin D deficiency would have posed\na serious threat in the north. But some of them happened to produce\nless melanin. They were exposed to small enough amounts\nof light that melanoma was less likely, and their lighter skin \nbetter absorbed the UV light. So they benefited from vitamin D, developed strong bones, and survived well enough to produce\nhealthy offspring. Over many generations of selection, skin color in those regions\ngradually lightened. As a result of \nour ancestor's adaptability, today the planet is full of people\nwith a vast palette of skin colors, typically, darker eumelanin-rich skin\nin the hot, sunny band around the Equator, and increasingly lighter pheomelanin-rich\nskin shades fanning outwards as the sunshine dwindles. Therefore, skin color is little more than\nan adaptive trait for living on a rock that orbits the Sun. It may absorb light, but it certainly does not \nreflect character."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The ingredient that gives skin its color and a version of its own sunscreen is known as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Melanocytes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pigment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Melanosome"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Melanin"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Variation in skin color is a function of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Intrepidness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Migration"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Biology"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Adaptability"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "From and to where where did the early ancestors of humans migrate nearly 50,000 years ago?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "From Africa to Europe and Asia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "From the region between the equator and the Tropic of Capricorn to Europe and Asia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "From the Tropic of Capricorn to Europe and Asia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "From North Africa to Europe and Asia"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What useful trait did the early ancestors living in the sun-saturated latitudes pass on to their offspring?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More eumelanin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "More melanin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "More pignment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What disadvantage did our sun-adapted ancestors have when they moved to northern latitudes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They made too much eumelanin, so their bodies could not produce enough vitamin D after UV exposure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They made too much eumelanin, so they could not get vitamin D from sun exposure"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They could not make enough melanin, so their bodies could not produce enough vitamin D after UV exposure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They could not make enough melanin, so they got sun-burned from UV exposure"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 41, "lesson": 3, "title": "How to speak so that people want to listen", "category": "Writing/Composition", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/0A3PRwvK", "transcript": {"en": "The human voice: It's the instrument we all play. It's the most powerful sound\nin the world, probably. It's the only one that can start a war\nor say \"I love you.\" And yet many people have the experience that when they speak, people\ndon't listen to them. And why is that? How can we speak powerfully\nto make change in the world? What I'd like to suggest, there are a number of habits\nthat we need to move away from. I've assembled for your pleasure here\nseven deadly sins of speaking. I'm not pretending\nthis is an exhaustive list, but these seven, I think, are pretty large\nhabits that we can all fall into. First, gossip. Speaking ill of somebody\nwho's not present. Not a nice habit,\nand we know perfectly well the person gossiping, five minutes later,\nwill be gossiping about us. Second, judging. We know people who are like this\nin conversation, and it's very hard to listen to somebody if you know that you're being judged\nand found wanting at the same time. Third, negativity. You can fall into this. My mother, in the last years of her life,\nbecame very negative, and it's hard to listen. I remember one day, I said to her,\n\"It's October 1 today,\" and she said, \"I know, isn't it dreadful?\" (Laughter) It's hard to listen\nwhen somebody's that negative. (Laughter) And another form\nof negativity, complaining. Well, this is the national art of the U.K. It's our national sport. We complain about the weather, sport,\nabout politics, about everything, but actually, complaining is viral misery. It's not spreading sunshine\nand lightness in the world. Excuses. We've all met this guy. Maybe we've all been this guy. Some people have a blamethrower. They just pass it on to everybody else and don't take responsibility\nfor their actions, and again, hard to listen\nto somebody who is being like that. Penultimate, the sixth of the seven, embroidery, exaggeration. It demeans our language,\nactually, sometimes. For example, if I see something\nthat really is awesome, what do I call it? (Laughter) And then, of course,\nthis exaggeration becomes lying, and we don't want to listen\nto people we know are lying to us. And finally, dogmatism. The confusion of facts with opinions. When those two things get conflated, you're listening into the wind. You know, somebody is bombarding you\nwith their opinions as if they were true. It's difficult to listen to that. So here they are, seven deadly\nsins of speaking. These are things I think we need to avoid. But is there a positive\nway to think about this? Yes, there is. I'd like to suggest that there are four\nreally powerful cornerstones, foundations, that we can stand on if we want our speech to be powerful and to make\nchange in the world. Fortunately, these things spell a word. The word is \"hail,\" and it has\na great definition as well. I'm not talking about the stuff\nthat falls from the sky and hits you on the head. I'm talking about this definition, to greet or acclaim enthusiastically, which is how I think\nour words will be received if we stand on these four things. So what do they stand for? See if you can guess. The H, honesty, of course, being true in what you say,\nbeing straight and clear. The A is authenticity,\njust being yourself. A friend of mine described it as\nstanding in your own truth, which I think is a lovely way to put it. The I is integrity, being your word, actually doing what you say, and being somebody people can trust. And the L is love. I don't mean romantic love, but I do mean wishing people\nwell, for two reasons. First of all, I think absolute honesty\nmay not be what we want. I mean, my goodness,\nyou look ugly this morning. Perhaps that's not necessary. Tempered with love, of course,\nhonesty is a great thing. But also, if you're really\nwishing somebody well, it's very hard to judge\nthem at the same time. I'm not even sure you can do\nthose two things simultaneously. So hail. Also, now that's what you say, and it's like the old song,\nit is what you say, it's also the way that you say it. You have an amazing toolbox. This instrument is incredible, and yet this is a toolbox\nthat very few people have ever opened. I'd like to have a little rummage\nin there with you now and just pull a few tools out that you might like to take\naway and play with, which will increase\nthe power of your speaking. Register, for example. Now, falsetto register may not\nbe very useful most of the time, but there's a register in between. I'm not going to get very\ntechnical about this for any of you who are voice coaches. You can locate your voice, however. So if I talk up here in my nose,\nyou can hear the difference. If I go down here in my throat, which is where most of us\nspeak from most of the time. But if you want weight, you need to go down here to the chest. You hear the difference? We vote for politicians\nwith lower voices, it's true, because we associate depth with power and with authority. That's register. Then we have timbre. It's the way your voice feels. Again, the research shows that we prefer voices\nwhich are rich, smooth, warm, like hot chocolate. Well if that's not you,\nthat's not the end of the world, because you can train. Go and get a voice coach. And there are amazing things you can do with breathing, with posture,\nand with exercises to improve the timbre of your voice. Then prosody. I love prosody. This is the sing-song, the meta-language that we use in order to impart meaning. It's root one for meaning in conversation. People who speak all on one note\nare really quite hard to listen to if they don't have any prosody at all. That's where the word\n\"monotonic\" comes from, or monotonous, monotone. Also, we have repetitive\nprosody now coming in, where every sentence ends\nas if it were a question when it's actually not\na question, it's a statement? (Laughter) And if you repeat that one, it's actually restricting your ability\nto communicate through prosody, which I think is a shame, so let's try and break that habit. Pace. I can get very excited by saying\nsomething really quickly, or I can slow right down to emphasize, and at the end of that, of course,\nis our old friend silence. There's nothing wrong with a bit\nof silence in a talk, is there? We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs. It can be very powerful. Of course, pitch often\ngoes along with pace to indicate arousal, but you\ncan do it just with pitch. Where did you leave my keys? (Higher pitch) Where did you\nleave my keys? So, slightly different meaning\nin those two deliveries. And finally, volume. (Loud) I can get really excited\nby using volume. Sorry about that, if I startled anybody. Or, I can have you really pay attention\nby getting very quiet. Some people broadcast the whole time. Try not to do that. That's called sodcasting, (Laughter) Imposing your sound on people around you\ncarelessly and inconsiderately. Not nice. Of course, where this all comes\ninto play most of all is when you've got something\nreally important to do. It might be standing on a stage like this\nand giving a talk to people. It might be proposing marriage, asking for a raise, a wedding speech. Whatever it is, if it's really important, you owe it to yourself\nto look at this toolbox and the engine that it's going to work on, and no engine works well\nwithout being warmed up. Warm up your voice. Actually, let me show you how to do that. Would you all like to stand\nup for a moment? I'm going to show you the six vocal warm-up exercises\nthat I do before every talk I ever do. Any time you're going to talk\nto anybody important, do these. First, arms up, deep breath in, and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that. One more time. Ahhhh, very good. Now we're going to warm up our lips, and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good. And now, brrrrrrrrrr, just like when you were a kid. Brrrr. Now your lips\nshould be coming alive. We're going to do the tongue next with exaggerated la, la, la,\nla, la, la, la, la, la. Beautiful. You're getting\nreally good at this. And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr. That's like champagne for the tongue. Finally, and if I can only do one, the pros call this the siren. It's really good. It starts\nwith \"we\" and goes to \"aw.\" The \"we\" is high, the \"aw\" is low. So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww. Fantastic. Give yourselves\na round of applause. Take a seat, thank you. (Applause) Next time you speak, do those in advance. Now let me just put this\nin context to close. This is a serious point here. This is where we are now, right? We speak not very well to people who simply aren't listening in an environment that's all\nabout noise and bad acoustics. I have talked about that on this stage\nin different phases. What would the world be like if we were speaking powerfully to people who were listening consciously in environments which were\nactually fit for purpose? Or to make that a bit larger, what would the world be like if we were creating sound consciously and consuming sound consciously and designing all our environments consciously for sound? That would be a world\nthat does sound beautiful, and one where understanding\nwould be the norm, and that is an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the most powerful sound in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "music"}, {"label": "B", "text": "human voice"}, {"label": "C", "text": "canary's voice"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "True or false: Exaggeration demeans our language.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are the four cornerstones of speech?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "honesty"}, {"label": "B", "text": "authenticity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "integrity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "love"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Can we learn to speak and listen consciously?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

(Laughter) Both my parents were educators, my maternal grandparents were educators, and for the past 40 years,\nI've done the same thing. And so, needless to say, over those years I've had a chance\nto look at education reform from a lot of perspectives. Some of those reforms have been good. Some of them have been not so good. And we know why kids drop out. We know why kids don't learn. It's either poverty, low attendance, negative peer influences... We know why. But one of the things\nthat we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance\nof human connection. Relationships. James Comer says\nthat no significant learning can occur without\na significant relationship. George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. Everyone in this room has been affected\nby a teacher or an adult. For years, I have watched people teach. I have looked at the best\nand I've looked at some of the worst. A colleague said to me one time, \"They don't pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. The kids should learn it. I should teach it, they should learn it, Case closed.\" Well, I said to her, \"You know, kids don't learn\nfrom people they don't like.\" (Laughter) (Applause) She said, \"That's just a bunch of hooey.\" And I said to her, \"Well, your year is going to be\nlong and arduous, dear.\" Needless to say, it was. Some people think that you can either\nhave it in you to build a relationship, or you don't. I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just\nthrow in a few simple things, like seeking first to understand, as opposed to being understood. Simple things, like apologizing. You ever thought about that? Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock. (Laughter) I taught a lesson once on ratios. I'm not real good with math,\nbut I was working on it. (Laughter) And I got back and looked\nat that teacher edition. I'd taught the whole lesson wrong. (Laughter) So I came back to class\nthe next day and I said, \"Look, guys, I need to apologize. I taught the whole lesson wrong.\nI'm so sorry.\" They said, \"That's okay, Ms. Pierson. You were so excited, we just let you go.\" I have had classes that were so low, so academically deficient, that I cried. I wondered, \"How am I\ngoing to take this group, in nine months, from where they are\nto where they need to be? And it was difficult, it was awfully hard. How do I raise the self-esteem of a child and his academic achievement\nat the same time? One year I came up with a bright idea. I told all my students, \"You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students, they put us all together so we could show\neverybody else how to do it.\" One of the students said, \"Really?\" (Laughter) I said, \"Really. We have\nto show the other classes how to do it, so when\nwe walk down the hall, people will notice us,\nso you can't make noise. You just have to strut.\" (Laughter) And I gave them a saying to say: \"I am somebody. I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better somebody when I leave. I am powerful, and I am strong. I deserve the education that I get here. I have things to do, people to impress, and places to go.\" And they said, \"Yeah!\" (Laughter) You say it long enough, it starts to be a part of you. (Applause) I gave a quiz, 20 questions. A student missed 18. I put a \"+2\" on his paper\nand a big smiley face. (Laughter) He said, \"Ms. Pierson, is this an F?\" I said, \"Yes.\" (Laughter) He said, \"Then why'd you\nput a smiley face?\" I said, \"Because you're on a roll. You got two right.\nYou didn't miss them all.\" (Laughter) I said, \"And when we review this,\nwon't you do better?\" He said, \"Yes, ma'am, I can do better.\" You see, \"-18\" sucks\nall the life out of you. \"+2\" said, \"I ain't all bad.\" For years, I watched my mother\ntake the time at recess to review, go on home visits in the afternoon, buy combs and brushes\nand peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer\nfor kids that needed to eat, and a washcloth and some soap\nfor the kids who didn't smell so good. See, it's hard to teach kids who stink. (Laughter) And kids can be cruel. And so she kept those things in her desk, and years later, after she retired, I watched some of those\nsame kids come through and say to her, \"You know, Ms. Walker, you made a difference in my life. You made it work for me. You made me feel like I was somebody, when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't. And I want you to just\nsee what I've become.\" And when my mama died two years ago at 92, there were so many former\nstudents at her funeral, it brought tears to my eyes,\nnot because she was gone, but because she left\na legacy of relationships that could never disappear. Can we stand to have more relationships? Absolutely. Will you like all your children?\nOf course not. (Laughter) And you know your toughest\nkids are never absent. (Laughter) Never. You won't like them all, and the tough ones show up for a reason. It's the connection.\nIt's the relationships. So teachers become\ngreat actors and great actresses, and we come to work\nwhen we don't feel like it, and we're listening to policy\nthat doesn't make sense, and we teach anyway. We teach anyway,\nbecause that's what we do. Teaching and learning should bring joy. How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were\nnot afraid to take risks, who were not afraid to think, and who had a champion? Every child deserves a champion, an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become\nthe best that they can possibly be. Is this job tough? You betcha. Oh God, you betcha. But it is not impossible. We can do this. We're educators. We're born to make a difference. Thank you so much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

So if you'd like to add a little humor to that story, or speech, \nor screenplay you're writing, here are a few tips and tricks\nfor finding the funny. All great storytelling, \nincluding comedy writing, consists of a handful \nof basic ingredients: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Writers have been asking these questions\nsince at least the 1st century BC, yet none can be answered \nwith a simple yes or no. They demand details, and the more specific the details,\nthe funnier the story. Let's start with the who,\nthe comedic character. Think about the books, TV shows,\nand movies that make you laugh. They're usually filled with funny types,\nor archetypes. The know-it-all, the loveable loser, the bad boss, the neurotic, the airhead. Incidentally, these are all stock \ncharacters found in Commedia Dell'Arte, or the artists comedy \nof late Renaissance Italy, and they have yet to get old. The Commedia rule for creating comic \ncharacters is find the flaw, then play it up. Or you can try playing with opposites. When the smartest guy in the room\ndoes the stupidest thing, or the doofus outwits the brainiac, we tend to laugh because\nwe didn't see that coming. Ancient Greek funnyman Aristotle\nis said to have said, \"The secret to humor is surprise.\" This surprise, \nor incongruity theory of humor, says we laugh at things \nthat seem out of place or run up against our expectations, like a frog dating a pig, or a lizard selling insurance, a baby disco dancing, a nun disco dancing, a cat disco dancing. Actually, a baby, a nun, or a cat\ndoing pretty much anything, especially involving disco. One fun way to find incongruities\nis by drawing connections. Actually drawing them with a mind map. Start small. Pick a word, I choose pickle. Jot it down, then quick as you can,\ntry making connections. What do pickles make me think of? Who eats pickles? What treasured pickle memories\ndo I have from childhood? Another great way to generate\ncomedic material is to shift from observation\nto imagination. Try going from \"what is\"\nto \"what if?\" Like, what if instead of a horse,\nfor example, you just had a pair of coconuts? Okay, let's think of some other\nmemorable moments in history, literature, or film. Now, what if they featured coconuts? Get wild, let it go. Even if an idea seems overdone, or too obvious, or just plain dumb, try jotting it down, anyway. What's obvious to you\nmay not be to the next person. And the opposite of the dumbest idea\nmight just turn out to be the smartest. What about all that dumb stuff\nthat happens in real life? Have you ever noticed how much comedy\nrevolves around things that irritate, frustrate, \nand humiliate us? Will Rodgers said, \"Everything's funny\nas long as it happens to somebody else.\" So if you're having a crummy morning, imagine it happening to a character\nyou're writing about, and by afternoon, you may at least\nget a funny story out of it. Once you've got your characters\nand story, here are a few quick and easy comedy\nwriting tricks to make them zing. The rule of three, or zig zig zag. Try setting up an expected pattern,\nzig zig, then flip it, zag. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut\nwalk into a bar. The punchline rule says put your punch\nat the end of the line. A rabbi, a priest, and a coconut\nwalk into a disco. That brings up the rule of K. For some reason, words with a k-sound\ncatch our ears and are considered comical. Coconut, disco, pickles, crickets? Okay, so we don't always get the laugh. Humor is subjective. Comedy is trial and error. Writing is rewriting. Just keep trying. Find the flaws, discover the details, insert incongruities, incorporate k-words, and remember the most important rule\nof writing funny: have fun. As Charles Dickins said, \"There is nothing in the world so\nirresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.\" And disco."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The basic ingredients of all great storytelling include:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Who"}, {"label": "B", "text": "What"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Where"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Why"}, {"label": "F", "text": "Wikipedia"}, {"label": "G", "text": "A, B, C, D, E only"}, {"label": "H", "text": "A, B, C only"}, {"label": "I", "text": "All of the above"}, {"label": "J", "text": "A, C, D only"}], "correct_option": "G"}, {"question": "Archetypes such as the \"Know-it-all\" and \"Lovable Loser\" are found in", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Commedia dell'Arte"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ancient Greek comedy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Big Bang Theory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The Incongruity Theory of humor says we laugh at things that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Surprise us"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Seem out of place"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Run up against our expectation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Punchline Rule of Comedy says you should:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Write a funny line about punch"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Punch anyone who cuts in line"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Line up for punch"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Put the punch at the end of the line"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Zig-Zig-Zag is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The design on Charlie Brown's t-shirt"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A pattern made of parallel angles and lines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A game you can play on your phone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Setting up an expected pattern, then flipping it"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Luckily for us, such a thing exists in the form \nof trillions upon trillions of human lab-grown cells\ncalled HeLa. Let's take a step back for a second. Scientists grow human cells in the lab\nto study how they function, understand how diseases develop, and test new treatments without\nendangering patients. To make sure that they can repeat\nthese experiments over and over, and compare the results \nwith other scientists, they need huge populations \nof identical cells that can duplicate themselves \nfaithfully for years, but until 1951, all human cell lines\nthat researchers tried to grow had died after a few days. Then a John Hopkins scientist\nnamed George Gey received a sample of \na strange looking tumor: dark purple, shiny, jelly-like. This sample was special. Some of its cells just kept dividing, and dividing, and dividing. When individual cells died, generations of copies took their place\nand thrived. The result was an endless source of\nidentical cells that's still around today. The very first immortal human cell line. Gey labeled it \"HeLa\" after the patient\nwith the unusual tumor, Henrietta Lacks. Born on a tobacco farm in Virginia, she lived in Baltimore with her husband\nand five children. She died of aggressive cervical cancer a few months after her tumorous cells\nwere harvested, and she never knew about them. So what's so special about the cells\nfrom Henrietta Lacks that lets them survive\nwhen other cell lines die? The short answer is\nwe don't entirely know. Normal human cells have built-in\ncontrol mechanisms. They can divide about 50 times\nbefore they self destruct in a process called apoptosis. This prevents the propagation\nof genetic errors that creep in after \nrepeated rounds of division. But cancer cells ignore these signals,\ndividing indefinitely and crowding out normal cells. Still, most cell lines eventually die off,\nespecially outside the human body. Not HeLa, though, and that's the part\nwe can't yet explain. Regardless, when Dr. Gey realized he had\nthe first immortal line of human cells, he sent samples \nto labs all over the world. Soon the world's first \ncell production facility was churning out \n6 trillion HeLa cells a week, and scientists put them to work\nin an ethically problematic way, building careers and fortunes\noff of Henrietta's cells without her or her family's consent,\nor even knowledge until decades later. The polio epidemic was at its peak\nin the early 50s. HeLa cells, which easily took up\nand replicated the virus, allowed Jonas Salk to test his vaccine. They've been used to study diseases, including measles, mumps, HIV, and ebola. We know that human \ncells have 46 chromosomes because a scientist working with HeLa\ndiscovered a chemcial that makes chromosomes visible. HeLa cells themselves actually have\naround 80 highly mutated chromosomes. HeLa cells were the first to be cloned. They've traveled to outer space. Telomerase, an enzyme that helps cancer cells evade\ndestruction by repairing their DNA, was discovered first in HeLa cells. In an interesting turn of fate, thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical\ncancer can be caused by a virus called HPV and now there's a vaccine. HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled\nthousands of scientific papers, and that number is probably even higher\nthan anyone knows. HeLa cells are so resilient that they \ncan travel on almost any surface: a lab worker's hand, a piece of dust, invading cultures of other cells \nand taking over like weeds, countless cures, patents and discoveries\nall made thanks to Henrieta Lacks."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What type of cancer killed Henrietta Lacks?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Colon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cervical"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lung"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brain"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why do scientists need to be able to study cells in a laboratory environment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "So they won't endanger patients' lives"}, {"label": "B", "text": "So they can repeat experiments"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because they need a large supply of identical cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What type of cancer killed Henrietta Lacks?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Colon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cervical"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lung"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brain"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How do HeLa cells keep dividing while other cells die off?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "HeLa ignore signals to stop dividing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "HeLa ignore mutations that accumulate over generations"}, {"label": "C", "text": "HeLa avoids apoptosis"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Research with HeLa cells lead to a vaccine for _____, which likely caused Henrietta’s cancer.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Polio"}, {"label": "B", "text": "HPV"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mumps"}, {"label": "D", "text": "HIV"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A disadvantage of working with HeLa cells in a laboratory is that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "HeLa cells die off after a few generations"}, {"label": "B", "text": "HeLa cells do not survive well on different surfaces"}, {"label": "C", "text": "HeLa cells spread easily and can infect other cell lines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "HeLa cells are difficult to obtain"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

i ask you to um to please recall a time when you really love something a movie an album a song or a book and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked and you anticipated that reaction you waited for it and it came back and the person hated it so by way of introduction that is the exact same state in which i spend every working day of the last six years i teach high school math i i sell a product to a market that doesn't want it but is forced by law to buy it i mean it's kind of it's just a losing proposition so there's there's a useful stereotype about students that i see a useful stereotype about you all i could give you guys a algebra 2 final exam and i'd expect no higher than a 25 pass rate and both of these facts say say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the us today to start with i'd like to break math down into two categories one is computation this is the stuff you've forgotten for example factoring quadratics with leading coefficient greater than one okay this stuff is also really easy to relearn provided that you have a really strong grounding in reasoning math reasoning we'll call it the uh the application of math processes to the world around us this is hard to teach this is what we would love students to retain even if they don't go into mathematical fields this is also something that the way we teach in the us all but ensures they won't retain it so i'd like to talk about why that is why that's such a calamity for society uh what we can do about it and to close with why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher okay so first five five symptoms that you're doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom okay one is a lack of initiative your students don't self-start you finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks students lack perseverance they lack retention you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later wholesale there's an aversion to word problems which describes 99 of my students and then the other one percent are eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation okay this is really destructive david milt a creator of deadwood and other amazing tv shows has a really good description for this he swore off creating uh contemporary drama shows set in the present day because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of for example two and a half men no disrespect it shapes the neural pathways he said in such a way that they expect simple problems he called it an impatience with ear resolution you're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly you expect sitcom size problems that wrap up in 22 minutes three commercial breaks and a laugh track and i'll put it to all of you what you already know that no problem we're solving is that simple i'm very concerned about this because i'm going to retire in a world that my students will run i'm doing i'm doing i'm doing bad things to my own future and well-being when i teach this way i'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks particularly mass adopted textbooks teach math reasoning and patient problem solving it's functionally equivalent to turning on two and a half men and calling it a day in all seriousness here's an example from a physics textbook it applies equally to math notice first of all here that you have exactly three pieces of information there each of which will figure into a formula somewhere eventually which the student will then compute okay i believe in real life and ask yourselves what problem have you solved ever that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance or you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out or you didn't have insufficient information and had to go find some i'm sure we all agree that no problem we're solving is like that and the textbook i think knows how it's hamstringing students because watch this this is the practice problem set when it comes time to the actual problem set you have problems like this right here where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit and the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this is molded from it helpfully explains to you like what what sample problem you can return to to find the formula you could literally i mean this past this particular unit without knowing any physics just knowing how to decode a textbook that's a shame so i can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math here's a really cool problem i like this it's about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift but what you have here is actually four separate layers i'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers and particularly how when they're compressed together and present the student all at once how that creates that this impatient problem solving i'll define them here you have the visual okay you also have the mathematical structure talking about grids measurements labels points axes that sort of thing you have sub steps which all lead to what we really want to talk about which section is the steepest so i hope you can see i really hope you can see how what we're doing here is taking a compelling question a compelling answer but we're paving a smooth straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way that's all we're doing here so i want to put you if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving so right here i start with the visual and i immediately ask the question which section is the steepest and this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers so we get people arguing against each other friend versus friend uh in pairs journaling whatever and then eventually we realize it's it's getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the midline and we realized how great would it be if we just had some a b c and d labels to talk about them more easily and then and then as we start to define like what what does steepness mean we realize it'd be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down specifically what that means and then and only then we throw down that mathematical structure the math serves the conversation the conversation doesn't serve the math and at that point i'll put it to you that nine out of ten classes are good to go on the whole slopes deepness thing but if you need to your students can then develop those sub steps together do you guys see how this right here compared to that which one creates that patient problem solving that math reasoning it's been obvious in my practice to me and i'll yield the floor here for a second to einstein who i believe has paid his dues he talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important and yet in my practice in the u.s here we just give problems with students we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem so 90 percent of what i do uh with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving and here's how it works i like this question it's about a water tank the question is how long will it take you to fill it up okay first things first we eliminate all the sub steps students have to develop those they have to formulate those and then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need none of it's a distractor so we lose that students need to decide all right well does the height matter does the side length matter does the color of the valve matter what matters here such an underrepresented question math curriculum so now we have a water tank how long will it take you to fill it up and that's it and because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks we go out and take a picture of it so now we have the real deal how long will it take it to fill it up and then even better is we take a video a video of someone filling it up and it's filling up slowly agonizingly slowly it's tedious students are looking at their watches rolling their eyes and they're all wondering at some point or another man how long is it going to take to fill up [Laughter] that's how you know you baited the hook right and and that question off this right here is really fun for me because like i like the intro i teach i teach kids uh because of my inexperience i teach the kids that are the most remedial all right and i got kids who will not join a conversation about math because there's like someone else has the formula someone else knows how to work the formula better than me so i won't i won't talk about it but here every student is on the level playing field of intuition like everyone's filled something up with water before so i get kids answering the question how long will it take i got kids who are who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation we put we put names on the board attach them to guesses and kids have bought in here and then we follow the process i've described and the best part here or one of the better parts is that we don't get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher's edition we instead just watch the end of the movie and that's terrifying all right because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key the back of the teacher's edition like that's great but it's scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical but those conversations have been so valuable among the most valuable so i'm here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class okay these are kids who who now one semester in i can put something on the board totally new totally foreign and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year which is which is just so fun we're no longer averse to word problems because we've redefined what a word problem is we're no longer intimidated by math because we're slowly redefining what math is this has been a lot of fun i encourage math users i talk to to use multimedia because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution in full color to encourage student intuition for that level playing field to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation to let students build the problem because einstein said so and to finally in total just be less helpful because uh the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways it's helping you it's buying you out of your obligation for patient problem solving and math reasoning to be less helpful and why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high quality curriculum in our front pocket it's ubiquitous and fairly cheap and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous i put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got um 6 000 views in two weeks i get emails still from from teachers and countries i've never visited saying wow yeah we had a good conversation about that oh and by the way here's how i made your stuff better which wow i put this problem on my blog recently in a grocery store which which line do you get into the one that has one cart and 19 items with lined with with four cards and three five two and one items and linear modeling involving that was some some good stuff in my classroom but it eventually got me on good morning america a few weeks later which is just bizarre right and from all of this i can only conclude that people not just students are really hungry for this math makes sense of the world math is the vocabulary for your own intuition so i just really encourage you whatever your stake is in education whether you're a student parent teacher policy maker whatever just insist on better math curriculum we need more patient problem solvers thank you"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But anthropologists theorize \nthat early hominids relied on lightning to cause forest fires, from which they could collect coals\nand burning sticks. Fire gave them the ability to cook food\nand clear land, and became central in many rituals\nand traditions. So instead of seeing forest fires\nas an exclusively bad thing, ancient humans may have learned\nto appreciate them. Yet, it wasn't just humans who\nbenefitted from these natural phenomena. Even as they destroy trees,\nfires also help the forest themselves, however counterintuitive that seems. In fact, several forest species,\nsuch as select conifers, need fire to survive. But how can fire possibly create life\nin addition to destroying it? The answer lies in the way\nthat certain forests grow. In the conifer-rich forests \nof western North America, lodgepole pines constantly seek the Sun. Their seeds prefer to grow \non open sunny ground, which pits saplings against each other\nas each tries to get more light by growing straighter and faster\nthan its neighbors. Over time, generations of slender,\nlofty lodgepoles form an umbrella-like canopy\nthat shades the forest floor below. But as the trees' pine cones mature\nto release their twirling seeds, this signals a problem\nfor the lodgepoles' future. Very few of these seeds will germintate\nin the cool, sunless shade created by their towering parents. These trees have adapted to this problem\nby growing two types of cones. There are the regular annual cones\nthat release seeds spontaneously, and another type called serotinous cones, which need an environmental trigger\nto free their seeds. Serotinous cones \nare produced in thousands, and are like waterproofed time capsules\nsealed with resinous pitch. Many are able to stay undamaged\non the tree for decades. Cones that fall to the ground\ncan be viable for several years, as well. But when temperatures get high enough,\nthe cones pop open. Let's see that in action. Once it's gotten started,\na coniferous forest fire typically spreads something like this. Flames ravage the thick understory\nprovided by species like douglas fir, a shade-tolerant tree \nthat's able to thrive under the canopy \nof lodgepole pines. The fire uses these smaller trees\nas a step ladder to reach the higher canopy \nof old lodgepole pines. That ignites a tremendous crown fire reaching temperatures \nof up to 2400 degrees Fahrenheit. That's well more than the 115-140 degrees that signal the moment \nwhen serotinous seeds can be freed. At those temperatures,\nthe cones burst open, releasing millions of seeds, which are carried by the hot air\nto form new forests. After the fire, carbon-rich soils\nand an open sunlit landscape help lodgepole seeds germinate quickly\nand sprout in abundance. From the death of the old forest\ncomes the birth of the new. Fires are also important\nfor the wider ecosystem as a whole. Without wildfires to rejuvenate trees,\nkey forest species would disappear, and so would the many creatures\nthat depend on them. And if a fire-dependent forest\ngoes too long without burning, that raises the risk \nof a catastrophic blaze, which could destroy a forest completely, not to mention people's homes and lives. That's why forest rangers sometimes\nintentionally start controlled burns to reduce fuels in order to keep\nthe more dangerous wildfires at bay. They may be frightening\nand destructive forces of nature, but wildfires are also vital to the existence of healthy \nboreal forest ecosystems. By coming to terms with that, we can protect ourselves from their\nmore damaging effects while enabling the forests,\nlike the legendary phoenix, to rise reborn from their own ashes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Lodgepole pine seedlings prefer to grow on ________, sunny ground.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Crowded"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Wet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Open"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Mature lodgepoles will form an umbrella-like structure called a(n)_________ that shades the forest floor.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Canopy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Parachute"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Awning"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Gable"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Douglas fir trees thrive beneath the umbrella of the taller lodgepoles because they are _________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shade intolerant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sun reactive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sun destructive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Shade tolerant"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Lodgepole pine trees develop two types of cones: an annual cone and a(n) ___________ cone.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Biannual"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bilateral"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Serotinous"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Resinous"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Wildfire can reach the crown of lodgepole pines by using smaller trees as a _______________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stepladder"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Springboard"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ramp"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Catapult"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But as you study the inscriptions\nin the near total darkness, two of the eight graduate students\naccompanying you bump into the alter. Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke\nburst forth and the walls begin to shake. Fleeing for your lives, you come to a room you passed before\nwith five hallways, including the one to the altar\nand the one leading back outside. The giant sandglass in the center\nis now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties, and the rumbling tells you that you don't \nwant to be around when that happens. From what you recall of your way here, it would take about 20 minutes to reach\nthe exit at a fast pace. You know this is the last junction\nbefore the exit, but your trail markings have been erased, and no one remembers the way. If nine of you split up, there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four\nhalls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making \na run down the correct path. There's just one problem; the inscriptions told \nof the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen\npossessing intruders and leading them to their doom\nthrough deception. Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students\nhave been cursed. At any time, \none or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. You know for sure that the curse\ndidn't get you, but you don't know which students\ncan't be trusted, and because the possessed students\nmay lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test\nthem to determine which are cursed. Can you figure out a way to ensure\nthat you all escape? Don't worry about the possessed\nstudents attacking or otherwise harming the others. This curse only affects\ntheir communication. Pause the video now if you\nwant to figure it out by yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since\nyou know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. This leaves eight students \nfor the remaining three paths. Sending groups of four down just two\nof the paths won't work because if one group came back split\ntwo versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust. But splitting them into one pair\nand two trios would work every time, and here's why. The possessed students might lie,\nor they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will \nalways tell the truth. When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give\nthe same report or argue about \nwhether they found the exit. If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying. With the pair, \nyou can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence\nabout three of the four paths.

He was aiming for\nthe nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers\nhe planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth\nof the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly \nand magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning \nilluminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish \nabout his approach. Lake Maracaibo is \nthe stormiest place on the planet. The massive body of water\nat over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it\nfor up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting\nfor several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result\nof opposing electrical charges that steadily build\nup inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference\nbetween charges either within the cloud or between the clouds\nand the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes\na lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth\nabout 350 million times per year, averaging out to 11 strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites\nup in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure \nthe Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which\nlightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes\nand how often reveals the most \nlightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike\nper several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density \nat the equator averages out to tens of flashes\nper square kilometer on account of the Sun providing\nmore heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare\nwith Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average\n250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density\nof any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create\nthe lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just \nten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy\navailable to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply\nof water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters\nof the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern \nand western edges are bordered by two massive \nmountain ranges, and as cool winds surge\ndown these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere\nand causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring\nthunderstorms on the planet— a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have\ncursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace\nthis phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse\nto illuminate their path across the seas."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many times does lightning strike the earth each year on average?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "35,000 times"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3.5 million times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "350 million times"}, {"label": "D", "text": "35 billion times"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In which country will you find the highest lightning density on Earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mexico"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cuba"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Peru"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Venezuela"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these regions has the lowest average lightning density?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Antarctica"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Africa"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Central America"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Southeast Asia"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How often do thunderstorms occur over Lake Maracaibo each year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Less than 10 days per year"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20-30 days per year"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Up to 50 days per year"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Up to 200 days per year"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which factors are important for the lightning over Lake Maracaibo?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Surrounding mountains and a supply of moist air"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Surrounding mountains and proximity to the equator"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Proximity to the equator and a supply of moist air"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All three (mountains, moist air and the proximity of the equator)"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

What's going to happen tomorrow,\nnext year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you're not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries\nto industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people\ncalled futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this\nwith surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as\nthe RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists\nand futurists who together forecast \nmany of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up\nresearch material for the reader. One way futurists arrive\nat their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends\nin society, and charting the paths they are likely\nto follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions\nof policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh \noptions for the future that otherwise could not have \nbeen imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how\ncertain anyone can be about the future. There are always unimaginable \ndiscoveries that arise which would make no sense\nto anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist \nfrom the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material\nexists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough\nenergy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. \"How can such energy come from nowhere?\"\nhe would demand to know. \"That's not science, that's magic.\" And for all intents and purposes,\nhe would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity\nor nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future\ncould have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology\nis indistinguishable from magic.\" How can we prepare, then, for a future\nthat will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone\nfrom the 19th century? We may think our modern technology\nand advanced data analysis techniques might allow us to predict the future\nwith much more accuracy than our 19th century counterpart, and rightly so. However, it's also true that our \ntechnological progress has brought with it new increasingly \ncomplex and unpredictable challenges. The stakes for future generations to\nbe able to imagine the unimaginable are higher than ever before. So the question remains: how do we do that? One promising answer has actually been\nwith us since the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that laid the foundation \nfor our modern world. During this time of explosive development\nand invention, a new form of literature, science fiction,\nalso emerged. Inspired by the innovations of the day,\nJules Verne, H.G. Wells, and other prolific thinkers explored\nfantastic scenarios, depicting new frontiers of human endeavor. And throughout the 20th century\nand into the 21st, storytellers have continued to share their\nvisions of the future and correctly predicted many aspects\nof the world we inhabit decades later. In \"Brave New World,\" Aldous Huxley foretold \nthe use of antidepressants in 1932, long before such medication \nbecame popular. In 1953, Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451,\"\nforecast earbuds, \"thimble radios,\" in his words. And in \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" Arthur C. Clarke described a portable,\nflat-screen news pad in 1968. In works that often combine entertainment\nand social commentary, we are invited to suspend our disbelief\nand consider the consequences of radical shifts in familiar \nand deeply engrained institutions. In this sense, the best science fiction fulfills \nthe words of philosopher Michel Foucault, \"I'm no prophet. My job is making windows\nwhere there were once walls.\" Free from the constraints of the present\nand our assumptions of what's impossible, science fiction serves as a useful tool\nfor thinking outside of the box. Many futurists recognize this, and some are beginning to employ\nscience fictions writers in their teams. Just recently, a project called iKnow\nproposed scenarios that look much \nlike science fiction stories. They include the discovery of\nan alien civilization, development of a way for humans\nand animals to communicate flawlessly, and radical life extension. So, what does the future hold? Of course, we can't know for certain, but science fiction \nshows us many possibilities.

{"page": 41, "lesson": 14, "title": "Why are human bodies asymmetrical? - Leo Q. Wan", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-are-human-bodies-asymmetrical-leo-q-wan", "transcript": {"en": "Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns\nmirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry\nis pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells'\nalways coil in the same direction. Some species of beans only climb up\ntheir trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body\nlooks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs \nare arranged asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas\nlie towards the left. The gallbladder and most of your liver\nare on the right. Even your lungs are different. The left one has two lobes,\nand the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look similar,\nbut function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed\nthe right way is critical. If all your internal organs are flipped,\na condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical\non the right and left. One theory focuses \non a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is lined with tiny hairs\ncalled cilia, while tilt away from the head\nand whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid\nfrom the right side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes\non the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells\nto make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo\nare chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually\ntranslated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart first. It begins as a straight tube\nalong the center of the embryo, but when the embryo \nis around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards \nthe right side of the body. It grows different \nstructures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar\nasymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs\nemerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs,\ndon't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all cells be \nintrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches\nthat all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured \ninside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up \nlike the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many \nof cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars,\nare inherently asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control \nwhich way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl. These biomolecules \nhave a property called chirality, which means that a molecule \nand its mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, \nthey look the same, but trying to put your right\nin your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the molecular level\nis reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "All climbing plants are twined in the same direction.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which human organ listed below is typically positioned towards the right side?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Liver"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stomach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spleen"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "At the node, towards which direction does the fluid flow, leading to the asymmetric positioning of internal organs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Left"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Right"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Head"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Feet"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which organ is first observed for its left right asymmetry during embryonic development?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Liver"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stomach"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spleen"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Can the cell be chiral in its structure and organization?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Ecosystems were hit with a double blow as massive volcanic eruptions filled\nthe atmosphere with carbon dioxide and an asteroid roughly the size\nof Manhattan struck the Earth. The dust from the impact reduced or\nstopped photosynthesis from many plants, starving herbivores and the carnivores\nthat preyed on them. Within a short time span, three-quarters of the world's species\ndisappeared forever, and the giant dinosaurs, flying pterosaurs, shelled squids, and marine reptiles \nthat had flourished for ages faded into prehistory. It may seem like the dinosaurs\nwere especially unlucky, but extinctions of various severities have\noccurred throughout the Earth's history, and are still happening \nall around us today. Environments change, pushing some species \nout of their comfort zones while creating new opportunities\nfor others. Invasive species arrive in new habitats,\noutcompeting the natives. And in some cases, \nentire species are wiped out as a result of activity \nby better adapted organisms. Sometimes, however, massive changes\nin the environment occur too quickly \nfor most living creatures to adapt, causing thousands of species to die off\nin a geological instant. We call this a mass extinction event, and although such events may be rare, paleontologists have been able \nto identify several of them through dramatic changes \nin the fossil record, where lineages that persisted\nthrough several geological layers suddenly disappear. In fact, these mass extinctions are used\nto divide the Earth's history into distinct periods. Although the disappearance \nof the dinosaurs is the best known mass extinction event, the largest occurred long before\ndinosaurs ever existed. 252 million years ago,\nbetween the Permian and Triassic periods, the Earth's land masses gathered together\ninto the single supercontinent Pangaea. As it coalesced, \nits interior was filled with deserts, while the single coastline eliminated\nmany of the shallow tropical seas where biodiversity thrived. Huge volcanic eruptions \noccurred across Siberia, coinciding with very high temperatures, suggesting a massive greenhouse effect. These catastrophes \ncontributed to the extinction of 95% of species in the ocean, and on land, the strange \nreptiles of the Permian gave way to the ancestors of the \nfar more familiar dinosaurs we know today. But mass extinctions are not just a thing\nof the distant past. Over the last few million years, the fluctuation of massive ice sheets\nat our planet's poles has caused sea levels to rise and fall, changing weather patterns\nand ocean currents along the way. As the ice sheets spread, \nretreated, and returned, some animals were either \nable to adapt to the changes, or migrate to a more suitable environment. Others, however, \nsuch as giant ground sloths, giant hyenas, and mammoths went extinct. The extinction of these large mammals coincides with changes in the climate\nand ecosystem due to the melting ice caps. But there is also \nan uncomfortable overlap with the rise of a certain hominid species\noriginating in Africa 150,000 years ago. In the course of their adaptation\nto the new environment, creating new tools and methods\nfor gathering food and hunting prey, humans may not have single-handedly caused\nthe extinction of these large animals, as some were able to coexist with us\nfor thousands of years. But it's clear that today, our tools and methods \nhave become so effective that humans are no longer reacting\nto the environment, but are actively changing it. The extinction of species \nis a normal occurrence in the background of ecosystems. But studies suggest \nthat rates of extinction today for many organisms are hundreds to thousands of times higher\nthan the normal background. But the same unique ability that makes\nhumans capable of driving mass extinctions can also enable us to prevent them. By learning about past extinction events, recognizing what is happening today\nas environments change, and using this knowledge to lessen\nour effect on other species, we can transform humanity's impact\non the world from something as destructive\nas a massive asteroid into a collaborative part\nof a biologically diverse future."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When was the most severe mass extinction in Earth’s history?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "66 million years ago when the dinosaurs went extinct"}, {"label": "B", "text": "252 million years ago when Pangea formed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5 million years ago when human relatives first started to walk"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Less than 10,000 years ago when ice sheets started to retreat"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Permian-Triassic mass extinction paved the way for what group of animals to diversify?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Insects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fish"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dinosaurs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Apes"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Mammals"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Species become vulnerable to extinction when:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The climate changes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "New species arrive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The species does not adapt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Their habit is changed or destroyed"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Paleontologists have identified many possible causes of mass extinctions.
