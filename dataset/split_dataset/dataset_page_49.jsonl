Here, I have a metal hard drive and a book\nand I'm going to ask people to compare their temperatures. Which one do you think will feel warmer - the\nbook or the hard drive? The temperatures? Yeah, tell me if one is hotter or colder or\nif they're the same temperature. How do they feel? This is slightly cooler than this one. Oh, that's warmer. Yeah, agreed. I'd say the hard drive is a lot colder than\nthe book. 'Cause the book's got more knowledge. Why do you think that is? Metal's normally a little bit chillier if\nyou leave it in a colder temperature. What if I said they're both the same temperature? What would you say? I'd tell you you're lying. I'd think you were lying, yeah. Well, maybe the way I can prove it is I have\nan infrared thermometer. What do you think we're going to see? I think science might be able to answer that. And I'm not a scientist! Make a prediction for me. I still think that's colder. Would you bet me money? I don't have any cash. Let's measure the temperature of the book. What do you see? 19.0. OK. Now measure the temperature of that. 19.0. Alright, well, now I believe you. I'm trying to figure it out, actually. Trying to figure out why'd they be the same\ntemperature. They don't feel the same temperature, though. So, why does that feel colder if they're the\nsame? Good one. You know the answer? I'm coming to you guys for answers. We're creatives, not intellectuals. Well, create an answer for me! I'm not a scientist! Come on, you tell me. I'll try to answer that question with another\nlittle experiment. Here is an aluminium block. Ooh! Nice and cold. And a plastic block. How do their temperatures compare? Completely different. Aluminium's going to be much colder. Yeah? This actually feels colder. Let's take this to the next level. I'll put an ice cube on both plates. What will we see? I'm guessing it would stay solid on this one\nand melt on this one. So it's going to melt on the plastic but stay\nsolid on the aluminium? Yes, but maybe I'm wrong. That one will melt more quickly than on the\naluminium. You'd think so. Yeah, 'cause it's cold. I think they're the same. We put an ice cube on each of those. What do you see? It's melting quicker on the aluminium. My God, it's melting! This is melting quicker than that one, even\nthough this is aluminium and that's plastic. So which one felt colder? This one. How does that make sense? No idea. Could aluminium be bad for the environment? How would aluminium be bad for the environment? It's thawing the ice quicker, isn't it? You want the answer? Yes, please! It's about thermoconductivity - the rate at\nwhich heat is transferred from one object to another. So when you felt these blocks originally,\nI know this one felt a lot colder. But you know from the other example we did,\nthat they must both be the same temperature. True. They've both been outside for a while. We see the aluminium block is melting the\nice faster than the plastic block because it's conducting the heat to the ice cube faster. With the plastic block, it's a worse thermoconductor. So, heat is being transferred less quickly\nto this ice block and so it's staying iced. OK. I believe you. Make sense? Yes. Definitely. In our first example, the hard drive felt\ncolder, even though it was at the same temperature as the book. That's because the aluminium conducts heat\naway from your hand faster than the book conducts heat away from your hand. Sure. That seems logical. Which makes the hard drive feel colder and\nthe book feel warmer. So when you touch something, you don't actually\nfeel temperature. You feel the rate at which heat is conducted,\neither towards or away from you. Think about this next time you hop out of\nthe shower in winter. It's much nicer to stand on the bath mat than\non a towel beside it. Not because the bath mat is warmer but because\nit conducts heat less quickly away from you."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the temperature of both the hard drive and the book?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "60°F"}, {"label": "B", "text": "66°F"}, {"label": "C", "text": "72°F"}, {"label": "D", "text": "78°F"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day. So I've seen enough videos on the internet of a mantis shrimp punching to have a good idea of what's going on, but I don't understand it, like at the mechanical level. So today on Smarter Every Day my sister has volunteered to model three seemingly unrelated objects to help us understand this a little bit better. But first, let's go to James Cook University and watch one punch in slow motion. OK where are we going? -We're gonna We're gonna go to a place called Yorkeys Knob. - Shut up! - That's the name of it. - To get some crabs. - We're not! - From Yorkeys Knob. (Destin) [laughs] I was hoping I could use that.. but... I can't. - It's true, the place is called Yorkeys Knob. (Destin) You weren't lying. So Yorkeys Knob, now I have to find crabs. - That one. That's a good one. Grab that one. Got him? -Got him. - There you go. Crabs in test tubes. (Destin) I have to say, I've never seen that before. - It works. It'll be cool. So what we'll do is we'll take one of the test tubes with the crab in it, we'll put the test tube down here which will keep the crab there. He'll come out and go.. bang.. hit the crab and smash the test tube. (Destin) Really? So the mantis shrimp is.. it's a peacock mantis shrimp. - Yep. - Look at that joker. It's pretty awesome. Hey don't they see more colors than any other animal? - Yeah. They've got incredible vision and their eyes are setup in parts of three. So the top bits look in a different part from the middle, which look at a different part from the bottom. - Kind of like the fovea on our eyes is different from.. - Yeah. - OK. - Out we come. Move little crab. [LOUD CLICK] - Bang! - It triggered. - Pull him out. [bang] [breaking glass] (Destin) Yeah, that's crazy. So let's back it up and watch again and you'll notice that there's a cavitation bubble generated at the exact point of impact. OK first of all, a mantis shrimp isn't even a shrimp. It's actually a stomatopod. We call it a shrimp because it kinda looks like it, but we also call it a mantis because it's similar to a preying mantis with its forearms. They have similar hunting strategies. Dr Seymour says that punch is so fast that it can't be accomplished by muscle movement alone, there has to be something else going on, which brings up Sheila Patek. Believe it or not, Dr Patek has determined that the shape of this potato chip is the secret to the punch of the mantis shrimp. Seriously. This shape is called a hyperbolic paraboloid, and if you've ever taken calculus you've seen it. It's basically a saddle shape and they're super strong. This saddle is located on top of the smasher, and the stomatopod uses his muscles to compress it like a spring and he holds it back with a latch mechanism. He then releases this potential energy and it drives the club forward at a much higher velocity than would be possible with muscle alone. So the next time you eat one of these remember there's another animal eating with the same shape you are, only he's doing it at the bottom of the ocean and he's got that shape integrated into the top of his arm. If you've ever played with a vice clamp before, you've seen this type of mechanism. You can slowly clamp down on the tool, which uses a cam-over action to lock it in place, and if you have it set right and squeeze it hard, you store mechanical strain energy. When you trip the latch the energy's released and the arm flies forward real fast, but think about this. Mantis shrimp use their little clubber to break open shells that are really hard right? So why does the shell break and the club doesn't? Let's watch another clip. This is Dr Seymour feeding a crab to the stomatopod except this time there's no test tube. - It's flicking the.. It's flicking the rock. Ohhhh! - Did you get it? - Dunno, might have. - Ohhhh I feel for that crab. [laughs] [bang] (Destin) Watch again closer and see if you can see the saddle release the energy. - Look at that. - Good grief. Snapped it straight in half. We're talking about serious forces here. In engineering we take two materials and we combine them together into composites to make them stronger. For example plywood is made of many layers of wood with the fibers oriented in two different directions. Mantis shrimps however take this to the next level with an organic polymer called chitin. At the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard, they determined that these fibers aren't rotated only in two principle directions like plywood, it's an entire helix, which gives the structure strength in many different directions. These strands are then bonded together in a mineralized matrix which makes the whole thing an incredibly strong smasher. But it gets crazier than that. The team put a section of the smasher in a synchrotron so they could analyze the material makeup. A synchrotron! That's like a particle accelerator. This is crazy science. They bombarded it hundreds of times to understand the density and the local orientation of the crystals in the material, and guess what. They found that the crystals near the surface were oriented perpendicular to the impact site and that orientation changed as we move away from the impact site. Basically the material changes composition and strength at different locations on the inside. The impact surface is incredibly hard, but the internal structure transitions smoothly to allow the distribution of a huge impulse load throughout the rest of that structure so it can punch stuff all day long without breaking. So instead of a normal composite like plywood, which are identical layers stacked up and glued together, a mantis shrimp club is a variable composite, meaning you can vary the material makeup and the strength orientation wherever you need it. This is an incredibly smart way to design a system. In summary, I want you to love the mantis shrimp. I don't want you to love it just because of the mechanics of how it throws the punch. Not because of the chemistry of the variable composition of the crystalline structure. The optics.. It can see circularly polarized light. This is an incredible, incredible animal, and I want you to think about it every time you eat a chip like this. Can you do that for me? OK I hope you enjoyed learning how mantis shrimp club. It's all about the hyperbolic paraboloid, or as my Cal 3 teacher taught me, hyperbowic pawabawoid. Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

The supercontinent Pangaea\nbroke apart 200,000,000 years ago, but the pieces haven't stopped shifting. Although with animation we can show\nthis movement easily with drawings, we thought it'd be more interesting\nto depict gigantic sliding slabs of rock using a tangible object\nthat also moves and shifts. and the pop-up book idea was born. (music) To make your own pop-up book,\nyou'll need some basic paper tools, such as scissors, an X-Acto knife, glue,\ndouble-sided Scotch tape, a ruler, a bone folder or other creasing tool,\nand, of course, some paper. For this lesson, \nwe first determined the visual style by making illustrations and \ndeciding on the overall design, colors, shapes and elements\nwe wanted on each page, or spread. You can have more detailed illustrations,\nbut we wanted to illustrate this lesson simply by playing with shapes and colors. When you visualize your pop-up\nand choose a visual style, you will want to make a bunch of\ngood old pencil sketches on paper and plan each movement for each spread. Plan as much as you can: all the basic shapes and how they connect\nand how you want them to move, which parts you want to pop-up first. Challenge yourself, and explore multiple possibilities of how your \nmain element on the spread can pop up. For the next step,\nmake a mock-up spread and see if your masterful \npaper engineering ideas translate from a sketch\nto the actual prototype. Instead of using fancy paper,\nstart with the cheap stuff and allow yourself to make \nmistakes and adjustments. This prototype lets you see\nhow your preliminary sketches will come to life. You will want to first draw\nall individual parts on a single sheet, including all your main pieces,\nall the supporting pieces and the folds. You may be surprised \nthat there are only two types of folds that can make your elements pop up\nthe way you want: a step fold and a V-fold. Here, you can see how we\nused a step fold to make each layer\nof the Earth step out. Then, cut all your individual elements\nand assemble using glue or double-sided Scotch tape. (Music) Through trial and error,\nmake sure that all the elements, shapes and placements\nare moving the way you imagined, and that they fold properly \nwhen closed and opened. (Music) Once your prototype is tested\nand complete, you can proceed to making the final\nproduct in color. Draw or paint on your main pop-up\nelements as you see fit. For this lesson, we decided to just play with simple shapes\nin different colors to create the world of shifting\ncontinents we imagined. (Music) When we were planning each spread,\nwe knew we wanted some elements to move independently \nof the typical pop-up book using slight manipulations and animations. We had to plan well,\nbut also use a few tricks. As always, when you're making \nstop-motion, you may have to be creative and\nuse all sorts of unusual tools and props to achieve the effect that you want. In this shot, the birds had to fly\nacross and off the edge of the book, so we used Fun-Tak to move\nthe clouds across the page. Once they left the page,\nthey had to be trimmed to get the illusion they flew off. When the pages of the book\nclose at the end, we had to flip each page,\nsupporting it in each position long enough to be photographed\nas an individual frame. We used binder clips,\nwedges, Fun-Tak, and almost every handy\nlittle thing you can think of. Once all the individual frames\nwere photographed, we put them all together\nand composited to make our pop-up book\nlook like it's moving on its own. So now, think of a special occasion where you can surprise someone\nwith your own unique pop-up card, or an entire story that you want to tell, and start plotting the ins and outs\nof your pop-up book."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The supercontinent Pangaea broke up 200 million years ago and the plates:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Moved apart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Moved together"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Slid past one another"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why use a pop-up book instead of animation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More interesting with tangible objects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Easier to create and takes less time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The objects on the pages move and shift"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A and C"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The overall design, colors, shapes, elements, and movements are represented on each page called a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Template"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stencil"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prototype"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spread"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The two folds you need to know for creating a pop-up book are the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cross fold"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Step fold"}, {"label": "C", "text": "V fold"}, {"label": "D", "text": "B & C"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A pop-up book needs to be able to fold properly when both closed and open.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

So, each instance of a white swan would\nmake you think, \"Yeah, that theory is pretty good.\" But the point is you can never\nprove a theory true and in fact when people found Australia they realized\nthat there were black swans. What was interesting for me was that\neveryone I spoke to came up with a rule very early on and then only proposed\nnumbers that fit with that rule they were thinking. I was looking for you guys\nto propose a set of numbers that didn't follow your rule and didn't follow\nmy rule. I was looking for you guys not to try to confirm what you believe. \nYou're always asking something where you expect the answer  to be yes, right? Like, you're trying to get at it.\nBut, instead you want to get the no's. You want to get the no because that's much more\ninformational for you then yes, Like everything is a yes.. That is true. That is really true and\nonce you say that. That is what's so important about the scientific method.

{"page": 49, "lesson": 5, "title": "The science of the Game of Thrones", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/sY9gSCqd", "transcript": {"en": "[MUSIC] Science is coming. [MUSIC] The Game of Thrones universe is one of the most brilliantly complex and utterly FRUSTRATING\nfictional universes ever created. But it IS a fictional universe, and the only\nrule of a fictional universe is that it is SELF-consistent. It doesn't have to agree\nwith our science, or logic, or even our commonly agreed-upon moral code that says killing people\nis not a good thing. There is only one god in that universe, and his name is Gurm.\nBut despite that, many things in Game of Thrones can be linked to the real, ACTUAL world, drawing\ninspiration as if through the thirsty roots of a weirwood tree. Many of these connections\nare interpreted by fans, but some have been verified by the bearded one himself.\nThere are the many competing religious philosophies, the many, many, MANY similarities to real-life\nhistorical characters or the fact that they LOOK like us? But we are not going to be talking\nabout those... Here's where I would give you a spoilers warning,\nbut . . . come on. You clicked on this. Spoilers are coming.\nWhy are the seasons so crazy? In the Game of Thrones universe winters and summers are\nknown to last years at a time and apparently show up when they damn well please. We know\nthat the summer/winter cycle normally averages around 5 or 6 years apiece, and as the story\nbegins the most recent summer has stretched to nearly ten years. On Earth, seasons are\ncaused by our axial tilt leaning one side of Earth toward or away from the sun during\nour annual trip around it, but George's world isn't so predictable.\nThe Maesters of the Citadel are the geeks of Westeros, who are supposed to calculate\nwhen the next Polar Doom will arrive. Westeros isn't an industrial society, but the architecture,\nmetallurgy, and medicine we see in the Known World suggests that these guys are a fairly\nscientific bunch. Many theories have attempted to explain the\nreason for these seasons, but most of them collapse faster than a Greyjoy's loyalty.\nWe know that the Westeros-ian world has a moon, and that it used to have two. Maybe\ntheir moon isn't as large as ours so the planet's axis, unstabilized by lunar gravity, wobbles\nlike a broken top. But, according to astronomers, moons don't stabilize planets, rather a moonless\nplanet should spin more evenly than one with a moon.\nThen what if its orbit, instead of a nearly circular ellipse, like ours, was extremely\nelongated? Well that doesn't work either. While it could cause extreme seasons, they'd\nstill show up on a regular schedule. Even complex combinations of orbital stretches\nand wobbles, like Earth's Milankovitch cycles, could be predicted by any society that knows\nbasic algebra. Well, then maybe it's tugged on by the gravity\nof a neighboring planet, or its sun has a variable output. George R.R. Martin did write\nhis first novel about a planet falling away from its parent star.\nIt's most likely that the Game of Thrones planet . . . it needs a name. Planet Hodor!\nlives in a very strange solar system, around a pair of stars. Last April, a group of graduate\nstudents from Johns Hopkins University published a paper showing that if the world of Game\nof Thrones was subject to the complex dynamics of three celestial bodies orbiting each other,\npredicting a planet's seasons would be impossible. This has interesting implications for Tatooine\n. . ? Of course, it could also be due to magic,\nwhich is cheating. And what about that world anyway? At the amazing\nplanetary science blog Generation Anthropocene, Miles Traer and Mike Osborne have constructed\na detailed geologic history of Westeros stretching back more than 500 million years into the\nfictional past. They determined that, since the North is cold\nenough to maintain a wall of ice, which we'll come back to, year-round, it must be near\nthis planet's Arctic circle, and since the south is warm enough to be covered by deserts,\nwhich primarily exist near Earth's 30th parallel that Planet Hodor has a radius of 4,297 miles\nor about 10% wider than Earth. We know that the First Men crossed into Westeros\non a land bridge near Dorne, and like Africa and South America, the coastlines of Westeros\nand Essos seem to fit like puzzle pieces. They were probably unzipped beginning 25 million\nyears ago by a spreading rift, like the one in the middle of our Atlantic Ocean.\nAnd 40 million years ago, Westeros was likely covered by a huge ice sheet, which retreated\nas glaciers, cutting the great valleys south of Winterfell and the Riverlands between Harrenhal\nand The Twins. The description of the jagged Black Mountains\nsounds a lot like our own Rocky Mountains, which were born around 60-80 million years\nago. This would also mark the birth of the Mountains of the Moon and the high Westerlands,\nas north and south Westeros smashed together just like the fault beneath the Himalayas.\nThat violent uplift is what exposed all that Lannister gold from its origin deep within\nthe crust. That era also would have borne the Iron Islands . . . but we have a different\niron to talk about. Valyrian steel was an alloy forged in the\nancient empire of the Valyrians, lighter and stronger than regular steel, and whose secrets\nwere lost during the Great Doom, when volcanoes torched Valyria, and its dragons, into charcoal.\nThat Valyrian steel was forged with dragon fire, which is not actually a thing, but it's\nalmost certainly a reference to Damscus steel, an ancient steel alloy developed in India\naround 300 BC. Like Valyrian steel, the secrets of its forgery were lost to history forever.\nSpeaking of dragon fire . . . what if dragons COULD exist? How COULD a living thing breathe\nflames? My buddy Kyle Hill came up with an interesting\ntheory. Like the tiny bombardier beetle, dragons could secrete reactive \"hypergolic\" chemicals\nthat, when mixed, react violently and shoot out of an orifice like rocket fuel.\nAnd if dragons chewed on certain rocks and metals, which I imagine are like cupcakes\nto them, they could coat their teeth in minerals, creating a spark with rows of deadly knife-like\nflint and steel. Unfortunately, our idea of a fire-breathing\nflying dragon is about to come crashing back down to Earth, because physics. As Bran Stark\nfound out the hard way, gravity seems to work in Westeros just like it does here. And that\nmeans the Mother of Dragons' kids are grounded. The largest bird that ever lived was the giant\nteratorn, with a wingspan of 7 meters. Not big enough.\nDragons are probably more like pterosaurs. But even the largest of those, Quetzalcoatlus,\nmaxed out at 11 meters from wingtip to wingtip and 250 kg. But Daenarys' dragons are bigger\nthan that by the time they hit puberty, and dragon lore says they never stop growing.\nEven with a pterosaur's hollow bones, ability to gallop on all fours to take off and huge\nstretchy wings, even Hodor could figure out that the dragons don't work. Unless, yeah\n. . . magic. The Wall? Won't work. A sheer cliff of solid\nice stacked 700 feet tall would melt at the bottom under its own weight and would fall\napart unless it was sloped Wildfire? Works. \"Greek Fire\" was an ancient\nprecursor to napalm made from petroleum, sulfur, saltpeter and was the most potent weapon of\nits time. Add a little trimethyl borate, and you've got a flaming death that's ready for\nSt. Patrick's Day. Milk of poppy? Works. Our opiate drugs from\nmorphine to vicodin to even heroin are all derived from the poppy plant.\nDire Wolf? Works. The extinct Canis dirus was the largest wolf to ever exist, covering\nNorth and South America, thousands have been found in the La Brea Tar Pits alone.\nOf course, the universe of Game of Thrones would live . . . or die . . . just fine whether\nor not it agrees with our science. But by combining the two, as Raymond Chandler said,\nThe truth of art keeps science from becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art\nfrom becoming ridiculous What do you think?

Most individuals, yes,\nthat includes you, will make anywhere \nfrom 500-1500 milliliters of gas and can pass gas ten to twenty\ntimes a day. But where does this bodily gas come from? A small proportion may come from\ningesting air during sleep, or at other times, but the majority of gas is produced by\nbacteria in our intestines as they digest parts of food which we cannot. Our intestine is home to\ntrillions of bacteria living in a symbiotic relationship with us. We provide them with a safe place\nto stay and food to eat. In exchange, they help us \nextract energy from our food, make vitamins for us, like vitamin B and K,\nboost our immune system, and play an important role in \ngastrointestinal barrier function, motility and the development of \nvarious organ systems. Clearly, it's in our best interest\nto keep these bacteria happy. Gut bacteria get their nutrition\nprimarily from undigested food, such as carbohydrates and proteins,\nwhich come to the large intestine. They ferment this undigested food\nto produce a wide range of compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids\nand, of course, gases. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide \nare the most common gaseous products of bacterial fermentation, \nand are odorless. Some people also produce methane due to\nspecific microbes present in their gut. But methane is actually odorless, too. Well then, what stinks? The foul smell is usually due to \nvolatile sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and\nmethanethiol, or methyl mercaptan. These gases, however, constitute\nless than 1% of volume, and are often seen with ingestion\nof amino acids containing sulfur, which may explain the foul smell of gas\nfrom certain high protein diets. Increased passage of gas is commonly\nnoticed after eating foods with high amounts of \nindigestible carbohydrates, like beans, lentils, dairy products,\nonions, garlic, leeks, radishes, potatoes, oats, wheat, cauliflower,\nbroccoli, cabbage, and brussel sprouts. Humans lack the enzymes, so the bacteria able to ferment \ncomplex carbohydrates take over, and this naturally leads to more\ngas than usual. But if you feel uncomfortable,\nbloated or visibly distended, this may indicate impaired movement\nof gas along the gastrointestinal track. It's important not to just \nblame certain foods for gas and bloating and then avoid them. You don't want to starve the bacteria\nthat digest these complex carbohydrates, or they'll have to start eating the sugars\nin the mucus lining of your intestines. Your personal gas will vary\nbased on what you eat, and what bacteria are in your gut. For example, from the same starting sugar, the bacteria clostridium produces\ncarbon dioxide, butyrate and hydrogen, while propionibacterium can produce\ncarbon dioxide, propionate and acetate. At the same time, methanogens\ncan use hydrogen and carbon dioxide produced by other bacteria\nto generate methane, which can reduce the total volume of gas \nby using up hydrogen and carbon dioxide. So there's a complex web among\nintestinal bacteria allowing them to flourish by either\ndirectly consuming undigested food, or using what other bacteria produce. This interaction largely determines\nthe amount and type of gas produced, so gas production is a sign\nthat your gut bacteria are at work. But in some instances, people may\ndevelop abnormal increased flatulence. A common example is lactose intolerance. Most individuals have the enzyme for\nbreaking down lactose, a sugar present in milk and\nmilk-derived products. But some people either lack it entirely,\nor have a reduced amount, such as after a gastrointestinal infection, so they're unable to digest\nlactose products and may experience cramping, along with increased flatulence \ndue to bacterial fermentation. But remember, most gas is produced as a natural result of bacterial \nfermentation in the intestine, and indicates healthy \nfunctioning of the gut. The amount and type can vary based on your\ndiet and the bacteria in your intestine. Exercise social courtesy while passing gas,\nand do try to forgive your bacteria. They're only trying to be helpful."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How much gas does an average person pass/day?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "200-300 mL/day"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1500-2500 mL/day"}, {"label": "C", "text": "500-1500 mL/day"}, {"label": "D", "text": "600-1200 mL/day"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Trillions of bacteria live in a symbiotic relationship with humans.

There's no doubt that the gondola \nis a symbol of Venice, Italy, but how did this curious banana-shaped\nblack boat get its distinctive look? The origins of the Venetian gondola \nare lost to history, but by the 1500s, some 10,000 gondolas\ntransported dignitaries, merchants and goods through the city's canals. In fact, Venice teemed with many types\nof handmade boats, from utilitarian rafts to\nthe Doge's own ostentatious gilded barge. Like a modern day taxi system,\ngondolas were leased to boatmen who made the rounds of the\ncity's ferry stations. Passengers paid a fare to be carried from\none side of the Grand Canal to the other, as well as to other points around the city. But gondoliers soon developed a bad rap. Historical documents describe numerous\ninfractions involving boatmen, including cursing, gambling,\nextorting passengers -- even occasional acts of violence. To minimize the unpredictability\nof canal travel, Venetian citizens who could afford it\npurchased their own gondolas, just as a celebirty might use\na private car and driver today. These wealthy Venetians hired two private\ngondoliers to ferry them around the city and maintain their boats. The gondolas soon became a status symbol,\nmuch like an expensive car, with custom fittings, \ncarved and gilded ornamentation, and seasonal fabrics, like silk and velvet. However, the majority of \ngondolas seen today are black because in 1562, \nVenetian authorities decreed that all but ceremonial gondolas \nbe painted black in order to avoid \nsinfully extravagant displays. Apparently, Venetian authorities did not \nbelieve in \"pimping their rides.\" Still, some wealthy Venetians \nchose to pay the fines in order to maintain their \nornamental gondolas, a small price to keep up appearances. The distinctive look of the gondola \ndeveloped over many centuries. Each gondola was constructed\nin a family boatyard called a squero. From their fathers and grandfathers,\nsons learned how to select and season pieces of beech, cherry, elm, fir, larch,\nlime, mahogany, oak and walnut. The gondola makers began \nwith a wooden template that may have been hammered into\nthe workshop floor generations earlier. From this basic form,\nthey attached fore and aft sterns, then formed the longitudinal planks\nand ribs that made up the frame of a boat designed to glide through\nshallow, narrow canals. A gondola has no straight lines or edges. Its familiar profile was achieved through\nan impressive fire and water process that involved warping the boards with\ntorches made of marsh reeds set ablaze. However, the majority of the 500 hours\nthat went into building a gondola involved the final stages: preparing surfaces and applying successive \ncoats of waterproof varnish. The varnish was a family recipe,\nas closely guarded as one for risotto or a homemade sauce. Yet even with the woodwork finished,\nthe gondola was still not complete. Specialized artisans supplied their\ngondola-making colleagues with elaborate covered \npassenger compartments, upholstery and ornaments \nof steel and brass. Oar makers became integral partners\nto the gondola makers. The Venetian oarlock, or fórcola,\nbegan as a simple wooden fork, but evolved into a high-precision tool\nthat allowed a gondolier to guide the oar into many positions. By the late 1800s, gondola makers began to make the left side\nof the gondola wider than the right as a counter balance to \nthe force created by a single gondolier. This modification allowed rowers to\nsteer from the right side only, and without lifting the oar from the water. While these modifications improved\ngondola travel, they were not enough to\nkeep pace with motorized boats. Today, only about 400 gondolas\nglide through the waterways of Venice, and each year, fewer authentic gondolas\nare turned out by hand. But along the alleys, street signs \ncontain words in Venetian dialect for the locations of old boatyards,\noar makers and ferry stations, imprinting the memory \nof the boat-building trades that once kept life in the most serene \nrepublic gliding along at a steady clip."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In 1562, Venetian authorities decreed that all but ceremonial gondolas be painted black in order to avoid:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An outbreak of the plague"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sinfully extravagent displays"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The growth of lichen on the hull of the boat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Confusion with other types of boats"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Historically, each gondola was constructed in a family boatyard called a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Varnish"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Larch"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Squero"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fórcola"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Oarlocks became more intricately carved over the centuries in order to allow gondoliers to have:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More control over their rowing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "More ostentatious boats"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A good reason for charging a higher fare"}, {"label": "D", "text": "More fun"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The majority of the 500 hours that went into building a traditional gondola involved:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Warping the wood with fire and water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Preparing surfaces and applying successive coats of varnish"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sanding the keel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Placing the ribs of the hull"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the late 1800s, gondola makers began to make the left side of the gondola wider than the right in order to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Make the boat more aesthetically appealing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Make it easier for gondolas to make right turns"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Allow rowers to steer from the right side only, without lifting their oar from the water"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Provide greater buoyancy"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

{"page": 49, "lesson": 12, "title": "What if the Earth stopped spinning?", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/3zhrMlKw", "transcript": {"en": "Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. The Earth is spinning and we are spinning along with\nit. But what if the Earth suddenly stopped spinning? \nWell, first of all, you would gain weight. But that would be the least of your worries. The spin of our planet is important and literally giving you the time of your life. At the equator, the surface of Earth, and everything on it, is spinning around at\n465 meters per second. As you move closer to the poles you\ndon't have to move as quickly to complete Earths daily rotation. \nHere in San Francisco, the Earth is driving me east at 368 meters per second. \nIf I could float above the surface independent of the Earth's rotation, the\nEarth would spin underneath me this quickly. Pretty cool. But, of course,\nwhen I jump straight up into the air, the Earth doesn't move underneath me\nbecause I continued to spin with it. We are all spinning with the Earth and\nthat is why slamming on a set of magical planetary breaks that caused\neverything classically called earth to stop\nspinning would be catastrophic. Immediately everything that wasn't Earth, and wasn't safely at the poles,\nwould continue moving, as it had been, and be flung due east at more than a\nthousand miles an hour. You wouldn't be flung into space because\nescape velocity is 24,800 mph but your body would instantly become a 9.5 inch caliber bullet. Well, really more of a supersonic tumbleweed. Because the atmosphere would more\ngradually slow down, people in airplanes, assuming they could navigate the\nresulting storms, might have a better chance of surviving. Astronauts aboard the ISS would fare even better. But it is unlikely that anyone would be waiting for them down on the ground. Runways would just be entrances to the new planet-sized graveyard, created by the no longer spinning Earth. People really really near the poles\nmight be okay but only at first. Gusts of wind, as fast as\nthose near an atomic bomb detonation, would blast, pass the surface and up into the\nsky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude. The friction alone, caused by the now stopped Earth colliding\nwith these winds, would be enough to cause massive fires, unparalleled erosion and damage to\nanything strong enough to stay put after the initial braking. The Sun would\nseem to freeze in the sky as days became not 24 hours long but 365 days long. Without spinning innards, Earth's\nprotective magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly\namounts of ionising radiation from the Sun. The oceans would surge onto land in\ntsunamis kilometers high and wash over nearly all dry land, before migrating to the poles, where gravity is stronger, no longer held to\nthe ocean basins by the inertia Earth's spin gave them, until Earth itself, no longer bulging an extra 42\nkilometers around its equator, because of its rotation slowly compressed into a more perfect sphere than it is now. Possibly allowing the\noceans to eventually return somewhat. That is what would occur if it actually happened.\nIt won't actually happen but woah, its rotation is slowing down. More on that later. First, if the Earth\nreally is spinning so quickly, why can't we feel it? Why doesn't the Earth's rotation make us dizzy? Well, lucky for us, the change in velocity is just too\ngradual. The Earth is too huge. It's like driving in a car that takes 6 hours and six thousand miles to make\none left turn. It's not sudden enough to\nregister with our senses. But that change in velocity is real and it makes us way less, because of inertia. On our spinning\nplanet your velocity is constantly changing but always tangential to the circular path you were\nbeing dragged along. Now, because inertia is a property of\nmatter, which includes your body, without a force acting upon us we would slowly leave the surface of Earth. Luckily, the Earth is exerting a force on us.\nA center-seeking, centripetal force, delivered by gravity. The centripetal force required to keep\nyou along a circular path with Earth is subtracted from Earth's total gravitational pull on you. The remaining force simply pushes you down, toward the centre of the Earth - it gives you weight. At the equator, if the Earth didn't spin,\nand no centripetal force was required to keep you with the Earth, you would weigh 0.3 percent more than you currently do. If Earth spun you around 17 times faster than it currently does,\nall of its gravitational force would go toward centripetal force\nfighting against your inertia and you would be weightless. So here's a diet idea. Hope that the Earth starts spinning faster and go back for guilt-free seconds. Seconds. We know exactly how long a second is. The outermost electron of an atom of cesium 133 is alone. When the atom is undisturbed, only the nucleus interacts with this outermost electron, tickling it regularly and rapidly between two levels. After 9,192,631,770 oscillations between those two levels,\none second has passed. Exactly. That is literally the definition of a second. We can measure and count those oscillations. It's how atomic clocks work. Making atomic clocks, the most accurate measurement device\never built by humans, to measure anything. We can't define a second more simply, as say, 1/60th of 1/60th of 1/24th of a day because of Earth's spin. It's too irregular. Little changes in the distribution of mass on Earth,\ncaused by earthquakes or melting ice or man-made dams or technically even you walking up stairs or downstairs, cause Earth's rotational speed to change. Like a figure skater moving their arms\nfurther away from or closer to their bodies. Now add on top of that the fact that tides, caused by the Moon, drag against Earth's rotation and you\nwind up with an unstable rotation speed that is predominately slowing down. Now, these changes are incredibly incredibly\nslight, but over time they add up. In 140 million years, a day on earth will not be 24 hours long, it will be 25. That might not sound like much but in order to do important things, like\ndeliver accurate GPS information, we need a more accurate timekeeping device than that. So, as a solution scientists keep the pace of seconds\nusing atomic clocks, TAI time. And other scientists measure the changing speed of Earth's\nrotation by observing distant stars and quasars. Now, every few months they\nfind out just how behind or ahead Earth is running, and if it's getting too\nclose to being a second off, they decide to add or subtract the\nsecond from the current year. The result is the time used almost everywhere, including your phone: UTC. Since this system began in 1972 25 leap seconds have been added. What this means is that clock time is, and has to be, a manufactured product with upgrades and tune ups administered periodically, after defects are noticed. The time we give to now and the future is only ever approximate. That's weird but it's also entirely not weird. As Demetrios Matsakis, the Chief\nScientist of Time Services for the US Naval Observatory puts it, \"we save lives and we end lives. We add time and we\ncan take time away, but in both cases we do so\nwithout completely understanding exactly what life is, or what time is.\" Regardless, thank you for spending some\nof yours with me... and as always, thanks for watching."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How fast is the Earth spinning at the equator?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "465 miles a second"}, {"label": "B", "text": "465 meters a second"}, {"label": "C", "text": "465 kilometers a second"}, {"label": "D", "text": "465 feet a second"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why are atomic clocks the most precise way of telling time?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "\"Normal\" clocks measure time based on the amount of time it takes the Earth to spin 360º.

But this wasn't a scene from a horror film\nor a gruesome police report. Dr. Scoville was one of the most \nrenowned neurosurgeons of his time, and the young man was Henry Molaison,\nthe famous patient known as \"H.M.\", whose case provided amazing insights\ninto how our brains work. As a boy, Henry had cracked \nhis skull in an accident and soon began having seizures, blacking out\nand losing control of bodily functions. After enduring years of frequent episodes,\nand even dropping out of high school, the desperate young man \nhad turned to Dr. Scoville, a daredevil known for risky surgeries. Partial lobotomies had been used\nfor decades to treat mental patients based on the notion that\nmental functions were strictly localized to corresponding brain areas. Having successfully used them\nto reduce seizures in psychotics, Scoville decided to remove \nH.M.'s hippocampus, a part of the limbic system\nthat was associated with emotion but whose function was unknown. At first glance, \nthe operation had succeeded. H.M.'s seizures virtually disappeared,\nwith no change in personality, and his IQ even improved. But there was one problem: \nHis memory was shot. Besides losing most of his memories\nfrom the previous decade, H.M. was unable to form new ones,\nforgetting what day it was, repeating comments,\nand even eating multiple meals in a row. When Scoville informed another expert,\nWilder Penfield, of the results, he sent a Ph.D student named Brenda Milner\nto study H.M. at his parents' home, where he now spent his days\ndoing odd chores, and watching classic movies\nfor the first time, over and over. What she discovered through\na series of tests and interviews didn't just contribute greatly\nto the study of memory. It redefined what memory even meant. One of Milner's findings shed light\non the obvious fact that although H.M. couldn't form new memories,\nhe still retained information long enough from moment to moment\nto finish a sentence or find the bathroom. When Milner gave him a random number, he managed to remember it \nfor fifteen minutes by repeating it to himself constantly. But only five minutes later,\nhe forgot the test had even taken place. Neuroscientists had though of memory\nas monolithic, all of it essentially the same\nand stored throughout the brain. Milner's results were not only the first\nclue for the now familiar distinction between short-term and long-term memory, but show that each uses \ndifferent brain regions. We now know that memory formation\ninvolves several steps. After immediate sensory data is temporarily\ntranscribed by neurons in the cortex, it travels to the hippocampus, where special proteins work to strengthen \nthe cortical synaptic connections. If the experience was strong enough, or we recall it periodically\nin the first few days, the hippocampus then transfers the memory\nback to the cortex for permanent storage. H.M.'s mind could form\nthe initial impressions, but without a hippocampus\nto perform this memory consolidation, they eroded, \nlike messages scrawled in sand. But this was not the \nonly memory distinction Milner found. In a now famous experiment,\nshe asked H.M. to trace a third star in the narrow space between \nthe outlines of two concentric ones while he could only see\nhis paper and pencil through a mirror. Like anyone else performing such \nan awkward task for the first time, he did horribly. But surprisingly, he improved over \nrepeated trials, even though he had no memory\nof previous attempts. His unconscious motor centers remembered\nwhat the conscious mind had forgotten. What Milner had discovered was that the\ndeclarative memory of names, dates and facts is different from the procedural memory\nof riding a bicycle or signing your name. And we now know that procedural memory relies more on the basal ganglia \nand cerebellum, structures that were intact in H.M.'s brain. This distinction between \"knowing that\"\nand \"knowing how\" has underpinned all memory research since. H.M. died at the age of 82 after\na mostly peaceful life in a nursing home. Over the years, he had been examined\nby more than 100 neuroscientists, making his the most \nstudied mind in history. Upon his death, his brain was\npreserved and scanned before being cut into over 2000\nindividual slices and photographed to form a digital map\ndown to the level of individual neurons, all in a live broadcast\nwatched by 400,000 people. Though H.M. spent most of his life\nforgetting things, he and his contributions\nto our understanding of memory will be remembered for \ngenerations to come."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "After Henry Molaison (H.M.) cracked his skull when he was young, which symptoms did he suffer?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Memory loss"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Seizures and blackouts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Loss of control of bodily functions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "B and C"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "After Dr. Scoville, the renowned neurologist operated on H.M. and removed his hippocampus, what about Henry stayed nearly the same?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The number of seizures he suffered"}, {"label": "B", "text": "His I.Q."}, {"label": "C", "text": "His personality"}, {"label": "D", "text": "His memory"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Brenda Milner, the PhD student sent to study H.M., helped prove:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Long term and short term memories are in one brain area"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Long term and short term memories are stored in different brain areas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Memory is all the same and stored throughout the whole brain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Memory is monolithic"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Declarative memory is different than procedural memory.

When your band is trying to perform,\nfeedback is an annoying obstacle, but in the grand orchestra of nature,\nfeedback is not only beneficial, it's what makes everything work. What exactly is feedback? The key element, whether in sound,\nthe environment or social science, is a phenomenon called\nmutual causal interaction, where x affects y, y affects x, and so on, creating an ongoing process called \na feedback loop. And the natural world is full \nof these mechanisms formed by the links between living \nand nonliving things that build resilience by governing \nthe way populations and food webs respond to events. When plants die, the dead material\nenriches the soil with humus, a stable mass of organic matter,\nproviding moisture and nutrients for other plants to grow. The more plants grow and die,\nthe more humus is produced, allowing even more plants to grow,\nand so on. This is an example of positive feedback, an essential force\nin the buildup of ecosystems. But it's not called positive feedback\nbecause it's beneficial. Rather, it is positive because it amplifies\na particular effect or change from previous conditions. These positive, or amplifying, loops\ncan also be harmful, like when removing a forest \nmakes it vulnerable to erosion, which removes organic matter\nand nutrients from the earth, leaving less plants to anchor the soil,\nand leading to more erosion. In contrast, negative feedback diminishes\nor counteracts changes in an ecosystem to maintain a more stable balance. Consider predators and their prey. When lynx eat snowshoe hares,\nthey reduce their population, but this drop in the lynx's food source will\nsoon cause their own population to decline, reducing the predation rate and allowing \nthe hare population to increase again. The ongoing cycle creates an up and down\nwavelike pattern, maintaining a long-term equilibrium and\nallowing a food chain to persist over time. Feedback processes might seem\ncounterintuitive because many of us are used to more predictable linear\nscenarios of cause and effect. For instance, it seems simple enough that spraying pesticides would help plants grow\nby killing pest insects, but it may trigger a host of other\nunexpected reactions. For example, if spraying pushes down\nthe insect population, its predators will have less food. As their population dips, the reduced predation would allow the\ninsect population to rise, counteracting the effects of \nour pesticides. Note that each feedback is\nthe product of the links in the loop. Add one negative link and it will\nreverse the feedback force entirely, and one weak link will reduce the\neffect of the entire feedback considerably. Lose a link, and the whole loop is broken. But this is only a simple example, since natural communities consist not \nof separate food chains, but networks of interactions. Feedback loops will often be indirect,\noccurring through longer chains. A food web containing twenty populations\ncan generate thousands of loops of up to twenty links in length. But instead of forming a disordered \ncacophany, feedback loops in ecological systems\nplay together, creating regular patterns\njust like multiple instruments, coming together to create a complex\nbut harmonious piece of music. Wide-ranging negative feedbacks\nkeep the positive feedbacks in check, like drums maintaining a rhythm. You can look at the way a particular\necosystem functions within its unique habitat as representing its trademark sound. Ocean environments dominated \nby predator-prey interactions, and strong negative and positive loops\nstabilized by self-damping feedback, are powerful and loud,\nwith many oscillations. Desert ecosystems, where the \nturn over of biomass is slow, and the weak feedbacks loops through dead\nmatter are more like a constant drone. And the tropical rainforest,\nwith its great diversity of species, high nutrient turnover, and strong feedbacks\namong both living and dead matter, is like a lush panoply of sounds. Despite their stabilizing effects, many of these habitats and their \necosystems develop and change over time, as do the harmonies they create. Deforestation may turn lush tropics\ninto a barren patch, like a successful ensemble breaking up\nafter losing its star performers. But an abandoned patch of farmland\nmay also become a forest over time, like a garage band growing into\na magnificent orchestra."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is an example of a positive feedback loop?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As glaciers melt, there is less white surface to reflect heat, which causes more melting"}, {"label": "B", "text": "As plants grow, their litter creates more soil humus, which in turn makes it hospitable for more plants"}, {"label": "C", "text": "\"Violence breeds more violence” – or, a violent act by one group causes their enemy to retaliate with more violence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Negative feedback is called negative because ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It counteracts disturbance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It causes degradation of an (eco)system"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It has a destabilizing effect"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It has no effect on system stability"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The strength of a feedback loop is ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The sum of the positive link strengths in the loop"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The sum of all the link strengths in the loop"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The product of all the link strengths in the loop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The sum of the positive link strengths divided by the sum of the negative link strengths in the loop"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If you have a feedback loop with three strong negative links, and one of those links turns into a very weak positive link, what will the resulting feedback be?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Strong positive feedback"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Strong negative feedback"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Weak positive feedback"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Weak negative feedback"}, {"label": "E", "text": "No feedback"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many feedback loops are possible in a food web of 20 species?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Up to 20"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Around 80"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hundreds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thousands"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How do all the feedbacks together in an ecosystem create harmony?

Can you predict the motion\nof the ball after it leaves your hand? Sure, that's easy. The ball will move upward\nuntil it gets to some highest point, then it will come back down\nand land in your hand again. Of course, that's what happens, and you know this because you have\nwitnessed events like this countless times. You've been observing the physics\nof everyday phenomena your entire life. But suppose we explore a question\nabout the physics of atoms, like what does the motion of an electron around the nucleus of a \nhydrogen atom look like? Could we answer that question based on\nour experience with everyday physics? Definietly not. Why? Because the physics that governs the\nbehavior of systems at such small scales is much different than the physics\nof the macroscopic objects you see around you all the time. The everyday world you know and love behaves according to the laws \nof classical mechanics. But systems on the scale of atoms behave according to the laws \nof quantum mechanics. This quantum world turns out to be\na very strange place. An illustration of quantum strangeness\nis given by a famous thought experiment: Schrödinger's cat. A physicist, who doesn't particularly \nlike cats, puts a cat in a box, along with a bomb that has a 50% chance\nof blowing up after the lid is closed. Until we reopen the lid,\nthere is no way of knowing whether the bomb exploded or not, and thus, no way of knowing\nif the cat is alive or dead. In quantum physics,\nwe could say that before our observation the cat was in a superposition state. It was neither alive nor dead but\nrather in a mixture of both possibilities, with a 50% chance for each. The same sort of thing happens\nto physical systems at quantum scales, like an electron orbiting\nin a hydrogen atom. The electron isn't really orbiting at all. It's sort of everywhere in space,\nall at once, with more of a probability of being\nat some places than others, and it's only after \nwe measure its position that we can pinpoint where it is\nat that moment. A lot like how we didn't know\nwhether the cat was alive or dead until we opened the box. This brings us to the strange\nand beautiful phenomenon of quantum entanglement. Suppose that instead of one cat in a box,\nwe have two cats in two different boxes. If we repeat the Schrödinger's cat experiment\nwith this pair of cats, the outcome of the experiment\ncan be one of four possibilities. Either both cats will be alive,\nor both will be dead, or one will be alive \nand the other dead, or vice versa. The system of both cats\nis again in a superposition state, with each outcome having a 25% chance\nrather than 50%. But here's the cool thing: quantum mechanics tells us\nit's possible to erase the both cats alive and both cats dead\noutcomes from the superposition state. In other words,\nthere can be a two cat system, such that the outcome will always be\none cat alive and the other cat dead. The technical term for this is that the\nstates of the cats are entangled. But there's something truly mindblowing\nabout quantum entanglement. If you prepare the system of two cats\nin boxes in this entangled state, then move the boxes to opposite \nends of the universe, the outcome of the experiment\nwill still always be the same. One cat will always come out alive,\nand the other cat will always end up dead, even though which particular cat\nlives or dies is completely undetermined before we measure the outcome. How is this possible? How is it that the states of cats\non opposite sides of the universe can be entangled in this way? They're too far away to communicate\nwith each other in time, so how do the two bombs always \nconspire such that one blows up and the other doesn't? You might be thinking, \"This is just some theoretical\nmumbo jumbo. This sort of thing can't happen\nin the real world.\" But it turns out that quantum entanglement has been confirmed in \nreal world lab experiments. Two subatomic particles entangled\nin a superposition state, where if one spins one way\nthen the other must spin the other way, will do just that,\neven when there's no way for information to pass\nfrom one particle to the other indicating which way to spin\nto obey the rules of entanglement. It's not surprising then that\nentanglement is at the core of quantum information science, a growing field studying how to use\nthe laws of the strange quantum world in our macroscopic world, like in quantum cryptography, so spies\ncan send secure messages to each other, or quantum computing,\nfor cracking secret codes. Everyday physics may start to look\na bit more like the strange quantum world. Quantum teleportation \nmay even progress so far, that one day your cat will \nescape to a safer galaxy, where there are no physicists\nand no boxes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Systems on atomic scales behave according to the laws of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Optics"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Classical mechanics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Statistical mechanics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Quantum mechanics"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Calculus"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In the Schrodinger’s cat experiment, before its state is observed the cat is in a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hyperposition state"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ultraposition state"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Superlocation state"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Echolocation state"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Superposition state"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "In the version of the Schrodinger’s cat experiment with two cats in which one of the cats always comes out alive and the other cat always comes out dead, we say that the states of the cats are said to be:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Intertwined"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Conjoined"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tangled"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Entangled"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Bojangled"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Quantum entanglement of the states of the cats will only happen if the cats are moved no farther than:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10 meters apart"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100 meters apart"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1 million miles apart"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Distance doesn't affect the result"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Outside of Dexter's lab"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Quantum Entanglement is central to studying:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How twin cats are psychically connected"}, {"label": "B", "text": "How cats always seem to land on their feet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Classical mechanics"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Quantum information science"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Trigonometry"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 49, "lesson": 17, "title": "Should I stay or should I switch doors?", "category": "Data Analysis & Probability", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/PWb09pny", "transcript": {"en": "Well 'Let's Make a Deal' was a popular show back in the day; contestants could go on this game show and maybe go home with the car of their dreams. First of all the game show host was a very famous guy named Monty Hall. And Monty would come on to the show and he would have three doors. And a contestant, that's you, would come on to the show, Monty would give you the chance to choose door number 1, door number 2 or door number 3. Now behind one of those doors, only one, was your dream flash car. Bright red, sports car, very fast; it was awesome. And behind the other two doors were 'zonks', that was the \n'Let's Make a Deal' word for something that you don't really want. So you had- looks like a 1 in 3 chance of getting your dream car. So suppose you pick door number 1; and Monty would then do the same thing every week. He would go over to the two doors you didn't pick, 2 and 3, and he would open one of them. Let's suppose he opened door number 2. And the door that Monty opened would always have behind it a zonk. \n- (So- so he knew?) Well he knows everything right? He's the game show host. And then Monty looked at you in the face and say, 'do you like door number 1 or do you want to switch?' There's only one thing to switch to, in this case it's door number 3. Are you gonna stay with your choice, or are you gonna make that leap to something different? And very often contestants would stand there agonised, right? So they've got some new information- \n- (So stick or switch?) Stick or switch. Well, a remarkable thing about this problem, simple as it is, is that it has sparked just endless debate. In the time of the show I don't recall anybody ever saying there was a dedicated strategy that you should always follow, but in fact there is a dedicated strategy should follow: you should pick door number 3. That's the answer, you should switch. You should switch every time and that will do the best for you over the long run. So there is a 1/3 chance that the car is behind the door you picked initially, that means there must be a 2/3 chance, much greater twice as big, that the car is somewhere else. And since we know that somewhere else cannot be door number 2, because Monty showed us that, it's got to be over here. So this is what you should choose, you should switch. Twice as likely to have the car behind the door that you didn't pick as the door that you did. 2/3 probability to a 1/3 probability. Now if you switch are you guaranteed to win? Absolutely not. But if you play this game over and over again, on average, you will win 2/3 of the time so switch is your strategy and you can't beat it. One thing that you might say is that the initial 2/3 chance that the car was behind door number 2 and door number 3 got concentrated behind the door that Monty did not open. That's effectively what's happening, that's intuitively what's happening, and that in fact is what the mathematics shows is happening. Now there is a way to see that in kind of a more grand way; if we imagine not having three doors but we imagine having a hundred doors. And let's imagine that we're playing the same kind of game, we have Monty over here, he is going to give you an opportunity to pick a door and your dream flash car is behind one of these hundred doors but there are 99 zonks all behind the other doors. Now what is it that you're going to do? Well you're going to pick a door, say again you pick door number 1. Now you're feeling a little bit different than you might have felt in the case where there were three doors; because there you thought, wow I've got a 1 in 3 chance. Here you're thinking I've got a 1 in 100 chance,\nI'm not gonna get that car. It's not behind door number 1, it's probably behind one of the other 99 doors. What Monty does is he opens 98 of those 99 doors, he shows you 98 zonks and he asked you now, do you want to switch? Well maybe just because of the sheer numbers this thing is a little clearer. You know that there was 99 out of a 100 chance that the car was over here and now the only door you're left with after Monty shows you all those zonks \nis door, say, number 37. And you're thinking, this is no good, this is no good, all those doors are no good; do I want to stay with 1 or do I want to stay with 37? You can sort of almost feel the concentration of that 99 percent going behind door number 37 and so you switch over here and very likely you're gonna get that car and drive away. (I like your car drawing.) Well thank you! (That makes more sense doesn't it? \nSuddenly it) (seems like a no-brainer.)\n- It does seem like a no-brainer but in fact when it's on a smaller scale, maybe just because 1/3 and 2/3 are a whole lot closer to each other than 1 in 100 and 99 in a 100, that the the point is is obscured. [Preview] X and Y is the probability\nof X given that Y happens, given that you know you open door number 2, what's the probability of the cars there, times the probability of Y happening by itself."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "True or False: Monty Hall reveals a goat behind one of the doors.

DeWitte", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-past-present-and-future-of-the-bubonic-plague-sharon-n-dewitte", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine if half the people\nin your neighborhood, your city, or even your whole country were wiped out. It might sound like something\nout of an apocalyptic horror film, but it actually happened \nin the 14th century during a disease outbreak\nknown as the Black Death. Spreading from China through Asia,\nthe Middle East, Africa, and Europe, the devastating epidemic destroyed \nas much as 1/5 of the world's population, killing nearly 50% of Europeans\nin just four years. One of the most fascinating\nand puzzling things abut the Black Death is that the illness itself\nwas not a new phenomenon but one that has affected\nhumans for centuries. DNA analysis of bone\nand tooth samples from this period, as well as an earlier epidemic known\nas the Plague of Justinian in 541 CE, has revealed that both were caused\nby Yersinia pestis, the same bacterium that causes\nbubonic plague today. What this means is that the same disease\ncaused by the same pathogen can behave and spread \nvery differently throughout history. Even before the use of antibiotics,\nthe deadliest oubreaks in modern times, such as the ones that occurred\nin early 20th century India, killed no more than 3% of the population. Modern instances of plague\nalso tend to remain localized, or travel slowly,\nas they are spread by rodent fleas. But the medieval Black Death,\nwhich spread like wildfire, was most likely communicated directly\nfrom one person to another. And because genetic comparisons of ancient\nto modern strains of Yersinia pestis have not revealed any significantly\nfunctional genetic differences, the key to why the earlier outbreak\nwas so much deadlier must lie not in the parasite but the host. For about 300 years during\nthe High Middle Ages, a warmer climate\nand agricultural improvements had led to explosive population growth\nthroughout Europe. But with so many new mouths to feed, the end of this warm period\nspelled disaster. High fertility rates\ncombined with reduced harvest, meant the land could no longer \nsupport its population, while the abundant supply of labor\nkept wages low. As a result, most Europeans\nin the early 14th century experienced a steady decline\nin living standards, marked by famine, poverty and poor health,\nleaving them vulnerable to infection. And indeed, the skeletal remains\nof Black Death victims found in London show telltale signs of \nmalnutrition and prior illness. The destruction caused by the Black Death\nchanged humanity in two important ways. On a societal level,\nthe rapid loss of population led to important changes\nin Europe’s economic conditions. With more food to go around, as well as more land and better pay\nfor the surviving farmers and workers, people began to eat better and live longer as studies of London cemeteries\nhave shown. Higher living standards also brought\nan increase in social mobility, weakening feudalism and eventually\nleading to political reforms. But the plague also had an important\nbiological impact. The sudden death of so many of\nthe most frail and vulnerable people left behind a population with\na significantly different gene pool, including genes that may have helped\nsurvivors resist the disease. And because such mutations \noften confer immunities to multiple pathogens \nthat work in similar ways, research to discover the genetic\nconsequences of the Black Death has the potential to be hugely beneficial. Today, the threat of an epidemic \non the scale of the Black Death has been largely eliminated \nthanks to antibiotics. But the bubonic plague continues to kill a\nfew thousand people worldwide every year, and the recent emergence\nof a drug-resistant strain threatens the return of darker times. Learning more about the causes and effects\nof the Black Death is important, not just for understanding how\nour world has been shaped by the past.

Wait, no spin the pan.\nThe other five are domed now? Whichever it is, this pan's defective. Here's a photo of Abraham Lincoln,\nand here's one upside down. Nothing weird going on here. Wait, turn that upside down one right side up.\nWhat have they done to Abe? Those are just three optical illusions,\nimages that seem to trick us. How do they work? Are magical things happening\nin the images themselves? While we could certainly be\nsneaking flashes of grey into the peripheral white spots\nof our animated grid, first off, we promise we aren't. You'll see the same effect with a grid\nprinted on a plain old piece of paper. In reality, this grid really is just a grid.\nBut not to your brain's visual system. Here's how it interprets the light\ninformation you call this grid. The white intersections are surrounded by \nrelatively more white on all four sides than any white point along a line segment. Your retinal ganglion cells notice that\nthere is more white around the intersections because they are organized to\nincrease contrast with lateral inhibition. Better contrast means it's easier\nto see the edge of something. And things are what your eyes\nand brain have evolved to see. Your retinal ganglion cells don't\nrespond as much at the crossings because there is more lateral inhibition\nfor more white spots nearby compared to the lines, \nwhich are surrounded by black. This isn't just a defect in your eyes; if you can see, then optical illusions\ncan trick you with your glasses on or with this paper or\ncomputer screen right up in your face. What optical illusions show us is the way your photo receptors and brain\nassemble visual information into the three-dimensional world\nyou see around you, where edges should get extra attention because things with edges\ncan help you or kill you. Look at that muffin pan again.\nYou know what causes confusion here? Your brain's visual cortex operates on\nassumptions about the lighting of this image. It expects light to come from\na single source, shining down from above. And so these shading patterns could only\nhave been caused by light shining down on the sloping sides of a dome,\nor the bottom of a hole. If we carefully recreate these clues\nby drawing shading patterns, even on a flat piece of paper, our brain reflexively creates\nthe 3D concave or convex shape. Now for that creepy Lincoln\nupside down face. Faces trigger activity\nin areas of the brain that have specifically evolved\nto help us recognize faces. Like the fusiform face area and others\nin the occipital and temporal lobes. It makes sense, too,\nwe're very social animals with highly complex ways of\ninteracting with each other. When we see faces,\nwe have to recognize they are faces and figure out what\nthey're expressing very quickly. And what we focus on most\nare the eyes and mouth. That's how we figure out if someone\nis mad at us or wants to be our friend. In the upside down Lincoln face, the eyes and mouth were\nactually right side up, so you didn't notice anything was off. But when we flipped the whole image over,\nthe most important parts of the face, the eyes and mouth, were now upside down,\nand you realized something fishy was up. You realized your brain had taken\na short cut and missed something. But your brain wasn't really being lazy,\nit's just very busy. So it spends cognitive energy\nas efficiently as possible, using assumptions about visual information\nto create a tailored, edited vision of the world. Imagine your brain\ncalling out these edits on the fly: \"Okay, those squares could be objects. Let's enhance that black-white contrast\non the sides with lateral inhibition. Darken those corners! Dark grey fading into light grey? Assume overhead sunlight\nfalling on a sloping curve. Next! Those eyes look like most eyes I've seen before,\nnothing weird going on here.\" See? Our visual tricks have\nrevealed your brain's job as a busy director of 3D animation\nin a studio inside your skull, allocating cognitive energy and\nconstructing a world on the fly with tried and mostly -- but not always -- true\ntricks of its own."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The connections between neurons in the retina, specifically the connections referred to as “lateral inhibition,” help us see which of the following better?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Contrast"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Faces"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Colors"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Improving the contrast of an image (making the dark regions darker and the light regions lighter) helps us to identify:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The edges of objects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The center of objects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The color of an object"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What assumption does our visual system make in order to see curved surfaces (domes, holes)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Light comes from above"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Curved surfaces are always evenly lit"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Curved surfaces are always easy to see, no assumptions are made"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which part of the face does our brain pay the most attention to?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Eyes and mouth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eyes and ears"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eyes and chin"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "If all these assumptions sometimes lead to mistakes, for example in these optical illusions, why do we make them?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It helps us see things faster"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It helps us see things correctly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It helps us pay attention to what's important"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

It's actually a baby yellow tang surgeonfish\nat two months old. And you thought your childhood\nwas awkward. But here is the same fish as an adult, a beautiful inhabitant of the\nIndian and Pacific Oceans' coral reefs and one of the most popular captive fish\nfor salt water aquariums. Of the 27,000 known fish species,\nover a quarter live on coral reefs that make up less than 1%\nof the Earth's surface. But prior to settling down in this\ndiverse tropical environment, baby coral reef fish face the difficult\nprocess of growing up on their own, undergoing drastic changes,\nand the journey of a lifetime before they find that reef to call home. The life cycle for most of these fish begins when their parents spew\nsperm and eggs into the water column. This can happen daily, seasonally,\nor yearly depending on the species, generally following lunar or\nseasonal tidal patterns. Left to their fate, the fertilized eggs\ndrift with the currents, and millions of baby larvae\nhatch into the world. When they first emerge,\nthe larvae are tiny and vulnerable. Some don't even have gills yet\nand must absorb oxygen directly from the water\nthrough their tissue-thin skin. They may float in the water column\nanywhere from minutes to months, sometimes drifting thousands of miles\nacross vast oceans, far from the reefs where they were born. Along the way, they must\nsuccessfully avoid predators, obtain food, and ride the right currents\nto find their way to a suitable adult habitat, which might as well be a needle\nin vast haystack of ocean. So, how did they accomplish this feat? Until recently, marine biologists thought of\nlarval fish as largely passive drifters, dispersed by ocean currents\nto distant locales. But in the last 20 years, \nnew research has suggested that larvae may not be\nas helpless as they seem, and are capable of taking\ntheir fate in their own fins to maximize their chances of survival. The larvae of many species are\nunexpectedly strong swimmers, and can move vertically in the water column\nto place themselves in different water masses and preferentially ride certain currents. These fish may be choosing the best routes\nto their eventual homes. When searching for these homes, evidence suggests that larvae navigate\nvia a complex suite of sensory systems, detecting both sound and smell. Odor, in particular, allows larvae to\ndistinguish between different environments, even adjacent reefs, helping guide them toward their\npreferred adult habitats. Many will head for far-flung locales\nmiles away from their birth place. But some will use smell\nand other sensory cues to navigate back to the reefs\nwhere they were born, even if they remain in the\nlarval stage for months. So, what happens when larvae\ndo find a suitable coral reef? Do they risk it all in one jump\nfrom the water column, hoping to land in exactly\nthe right spot to settle down and metamorphose into adults? Not exactly. Instead, larvae appear to have\nmore of a bungee system. Larvae will drop down in the water column\nto check out a reef below. If conditions aren't right,\nthey can jump back up into higher water masses and ride on, chancing that the next reef\nthey find will be a better fit. But this is the point\nwhere our knowledge ends. We don't know the geographic movements\nof individual larva for most species. Nor do we know which exact environmental\ncues and behaviors they use to navigate to the reefs\nthey will call home. But we do know that these tiny trekkers are more than the fragile\nand helpless creatures science once believed them to be. The secret lives of baby fish \nremain largely mysterious to us, unknown adventures waiting to be told."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Coral reefs cover less than ____ % of the earth’s surface.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "0.1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "15"}, {"label": "E", "text": "40"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which phase of the coral reef fish life cycle is most likely to disperse long distances?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Egg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Larvae"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Adult fish"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above – fish stay where they were born"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How long can the larval phase last?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Minutes to days"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Minutes to weeks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Minutes to months"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Weeks to months"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Weeks to years"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following are challenges to larval coral reef fish?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Avoiding predators"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Finding food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Finding a mate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Finding suitable adult habitat"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A, B, and D"}, {"label": "F", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What is one historical misconception about coral reef fish, which is now being challenged?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "That they navigate using smell"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That they are strong swimmers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That they are helpless, passive drifters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That they can travel long distances"}, {"label": "E", "text": "That they can distinguish between adjacent reefs"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
