And do you know where we get that energy? That’s right…from the food we eat! And all kinds of different people enjoy different\nkinds of food. But whether your favorite meal includes noodles\nor nectarines, tortillas or tofu, most types of food have some of what our bodies need\nto stay healthy. You might already know that we can put different\nkinds of food into different groups. We call these, you guessed it, food groups! But let’s check out each group, and see\nwhat kind of food belongs where! Let’s start with the fruit group. You gotta love sweet, delicious fruit! This group includes things like apples and\npears, oranges and strawberries. Fresh fruit is the best for you, but fruit\nthat’s canned or frozen counts, too. After all, many fruits are hard to find in\nthe winter, and some fruits only grow in certain parts of the world. But don’t forget about fruit that’s been\ndried! Raisins are just dried grapes! And prunes are dried-up plums! And even juice is part of the fruit group,\nbut only if it’s all fruit juice and doesn’t have added sugar. Next comes the grain group. Grains are plants, like oats, wheat, and barley. If a food is made from one of these plants,\nor any other grain plant, it belongs here. That means things made of flour, like bread\nand noodles, breakfast foods like oatmeal and cereal, and even rice, are all part of\nthis group. Next up, the vegetable group. I bet you already figured out what goes here! Vegetables come from plants, too -- but unlike\ngrains, they’re either the roots, stems, or leaves of certain plants that we can eat! Carrots, for example, are the sweet orange\nroots of the carrot plant. A head of lettuce is just a bunch of crunchy\nleaves. And asparagus is actually a stem of the tasty\nasparagus plant! There are so many kinds of veggies out there,\nthat we can actually split this group into smaller groups. For example, there are dark green veggies,\nlike spinach. Starchy vegetables, like potatoes and sweet\npotatoes. Then, there are red and orange veggies, like\nbeets and carrots, just to name a few. Now, what other foods can you think of? What about the stuff that’s inside your\nsandwich? Meats, like chicken or hamburger, belong to\nthe protein group. And so do fish, like tuna, and eggs, made\nany way you like! But not all members of this group come from\nanimals. Other foods like beans, peanut butter, and\ntofu, which is made from soybeans, are full of protein, so they’re also proud members\nof the protein group. And that leaves us with the last group, dairy. If a food is made from cow milk or soy milk,\nit’s in the dairy group. So this is where you find things like yogurt,\nand all kinds of cheeses, as well as your usual glass of milk. And do you know what else fits in this group? Ice cream! But that reminds me, sweet treats like candy\ndon’t fit into any of our groups. That’s because they’re made of mostly\nsugar, and don’t have any of the things that our bodies need to stay healthy. So, it’s okay to enjoy these foods from\ntime to time … but just not a lot of the time. Now, do you think you can put a food into\nthe right group? Let’s take a tasty food quiz and see how\nwell we know our food groups! We’ll start with a slice of pineapple. What group do you think it goes in? Squeaks says the fruit group. Good job, Squeaks! Yes, pineapple belongs in the fruit group. What about this hard boiled egg? What group do you think this fits into? That’s right, the protein group. Eggs are a good source of protein. Here’s one more. We’ll end our game with a food that fits\ninto two groups: macaroni and cheese. Let’s look at each part separately. The cheese from the mac and cheese fits into\nthe dairy group, because it’s made from milk. But what about the macaroni noodles? Well, we learned earlier that noodles are\nmade of flour from grain. So, that means the macaroni belongs to the\ngrain group! That’s right! Macaroni and cheese contains foods that are\nin the dairy group and the grain group. Whew! All this guessing has made me hungry! Hey Squeaks! Let’s make a snack! And remember, the next time you’re hungry\nand head to the pantry or fridge…choose something healthy…and see if you can guess\nwhat group your food fits into!

There’s no accident, no stoplight, no change in speed limit \nor narrowing of the road. So why the @#$%! is there \nso much traffic? When traffic comes to a near standstill \nfor no apparent reason, it’s called a phantom traffic jam. A phantom traffic jam \nis an emergent phenomenon whose behavior takes on a life of its own,\ngreater than the sum of its parts. But in spite of this, \nwe can actually model these jams, even understand the principles \nthat shape them— and we’re closer than you might think to preventing this kind of traffic\nin the future. For a phantom traffic jam to form, \nthere must be a lot of cars on the road. That doesn’t mean \nthere are necessarily too many cars to pass through a stretch \nof roadway smoothly, at least not if every driver maintains \nthe same consistent speed and spacing from other drivers. In this dense, but flowing, traffic, it only takes a minor disturbance \nto set off the chain of events that causes a traffic jam. Say one driver brakes slightly. Each successive driver then brakes \na little more strongly, creating a wave of brake lights \nthat propagates backward through the cars on the road. These stop-and-go waves \ncan travel along a highway for miles. With a low density of cars on the road, traffic flows smoothly \nbecause small disturbances, like individual cars changing lanes \nor slowing down at a curve, are absorbed by other \ndrivers’ adjustments. But once the number of cars \non the road exceeds a critical density, generally when cars are spaced \nless than 35 meters apart, the system’s behavior \nchanges dramatically. It begins to display dynamic instability, \nmeaning small disturbances are amplified. Dynamic instability isn’t unique \nto phantom traffic jams— it’s also responsible for raindrops, \nsand dunes, cloud patterns, and more. The instability is \na positive feedback loop. Above the critical density, any additional vehicle reduces \nthe number of cars per second passing through a given point on the road. This in turn means it takes longer \nfor a local pileup to move out of a section of the road, \nincreasing vehicle density even more, which eventually adds up \nto stop-and-go traffic. Drivers tend not to realize they need \nto break far in advance of a traffic jam, which means they end up having \nto brake harder to avoid a collision. This strengthens the wave of braking \nfrom vehicle to vehicle. What’s more, drivers tend to accelerate\ntoo rapidly out of a slowdown, meaning they try to drive faster than the average flow of traffic \ndownstream of them. Then, they have to brake again, \neventually producing another feedback loop that causes more stop-and-go traffic. In both cases, drivers make traffic worse simply because they don’t have a good\nsense of the conditions ahead of them. Self driving cars equipped with data \non traffic conditions ahead from connected vehicles \nor roadway sensors might be able to counteract \nphantom traffic in real-time. These vehicles would maintain \na uniform speed, safety permitting, that matches the average speed \nof the overall flow, preventing traffic waves from forming. In situations where there’s \nalready a traffic wave, the automated vehicle \nwould be able to anticipate it, braking sooner and more gradually \nthan a human driver and reducing the strength of the wave. And it wouldn’t take that many \nself-driving cars— In a recent experiment, one autonomous \nvehicle for every 20 human drivers was enough to dampen \nand prevent traffic waves. Traffic jams are not only \na daily annoyance– they’re a major cause of fatalities, wasted resources, \nand planet-threatening pollution. But new technology may help reduce \nthese patterns, rendering our roads safer, our daily commutes more efficient, \nand our air cleaner. And the next time you’re stuck in traffic, it may help to remember that other drivers\naren’t necessarily driving spitefully, but are simply unaware of road \nconditions ahead— and drive accordingly."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Stop-and-go traffic results from a positive feedback loop.

whole christmas season now please don't ask why no one quite knows the reason it could be his head wasn't screwed on just right it could be perhaps that his shoes were too tight [Music] but i think that the most likely reason of all may have been that his heart was two sizes too small but whatever the reason his heart or his shoes he stood there on christmas eve hating the whos staring down from his cave with a sour grinchy frown at the warm lighted windows below in their town for he knew every who down in whoville beneath was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath [Music] and they're hanging their stockings he snarled with a sneer tomorrow is christmas it's practically here then he growled with his grinch fingers nervously drumming i must find some way to stop christmas from coming for tomorrow he knew all the who girls and boys would wake bright and early they'd rush for their toys and then oh the noise oh the noise noise noise noise that's one thing he hated the noise noise noise noise then the whos young and old would sit down to a feast and they'd feast and they'd feast and they'd feast feast feast feast they would feast on who pudding and rare who roast beast which was something the grinch couldn't stand in the least [Music] and then they'd do something he liked least of all every who down in whoville the tall and the small would stand close together with christmas bells ringing they'd stand hand in hand and the whos would start singing they'd sing and they'd sing and they'd sing sing sing sing [Music] and the more the grinch thought of this who christmas sing the more the grinch thought i must stop this whole thing why for 53 years i've put up with it now i must stop this christmas from coming but how then he got an idea an awful idea the grinch got a wonderful awful idea i know just what to do the grinch laughed in his throat and he made a quick santy claws hat and a coat [Music] and he chuckled and clucked what a great grinchy trick with this coat and this hat i look just like saint nick all i need is a reindeer the grinch looked around but since reindeer are scarce there was none to be found did that stop the old grinch no the grinch simply said if i can't find a reindeer i'll make one instead so he called his dog max then he took some red thread and he tied a big horn on the top of his head [Music] then he loaded some bags and some old empty sacks on a ramshackle sleigh and he hitched up old max then the grinch said get up and the sleigh started down toward the homes where the whos lay a snooze in their town all their windows were dark quiet snow filled the air all the whos were all dreaming sweet dreams without care when he came to the first little house on the square this is stop number one the old grinchy claws hissed and he climbed to the roof empty bags in his fist then he slid down the chimney a rather tight pinch but if santa could do it then so could the grinch he got stuck only once for a moment or two then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flew [Music] were the little who stockings all hung in a row these stockings he grinned are the first things to go then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant around the whole room and he took every present pop guns and bicycles roller skates drums checkerboards tricycles popcorn and plums [Music] and he stuffed them in bags then the grinch very nimbly stuffed all the bags one by one up the chimbley then he slunk to the icebox he took the who's feast he took the who pudding he took the roast beast [Music] he cleaned out that icebox as quick as a flash why that grinch even took their last can of who hash [Music] then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee and now grinned the grinch i will stuff up the tree and the grinch grabbed the tree and he started to shove when he heard a small sound like the coup of a dove [Music] he turned around fast and he saw a small who little cindy lou who who was not more than two [Music] the grinch had been caught by this tiny hoo daughter who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold water she stared at the grinch and said santy claus why why are you taking our christmas tree why [Music] but you know that old grinch was so smart and so slick he thought up a lie and he thought it up quick why my sweet little tot the fake santy claws lied there's a light on this tree that won't light on one side [Music] so i'm taking it home to my workshop my dear i'll fix it up there then i'll bring it back here and his fib fooled the child then he patted her head and he got her a drink and he sent her to bed [Music] and when cindy lou who went to bed with her cup he went to the chimney and stuffed the tree up then the last thing he took was the log for their fire then he went up the chimney himself the old liar on their walls he left nothing but hooks and some wire [Music] and the one speck of food that he left in the house was a crumb that was even too small for a mouse then he did the same thing to the other who's houses leaving crumbs much too small for the other whose mouses it was quarter past dawn all the who's still a bed all the who's still a snooze when he packed up his sled [Music] packed it up with their presents the ribbons the wrappings the tags and the tinsel the trimmings the trappings [Music] three thousand feet up up the side of mount crumpet he rode with his load to the tip top to dump it pooh pooh to the whos he was grinchishly humming they're finding out now that no christmas is coming [Music] they're just waking up i know just what they'll do their mouths will hang open a minute or two then the who's down in whoville will all cry boo hoo that's a noise grinned the grinch that i simply must hear so he paused and the grinch put his hand to his ear [Music] and he did hear a sound rising over the snow it started in low then it started to grow but the sound wasn't sad why the sound sounded merry it couldn't be so but it was mary very [Music] he stared down at whoville the grinch popped his eyes then he shook what he saw was a shocking surprise [Music] every who down in whoville the tall and the small was singing without any presence at all [Music] he hadn't stopped christmas from coming it came somehow or other it came just the same and the grinch with his grinch feet ice cold in the snow stood puzzling and puzzling how could it be so [Music] it came without ribbons it came without tags it came without packages boxes or bags [Music] and he puzzled three hours till his puzzler was sore then the grinch thought of something he hadn't before [Music] maybe christmas he thought doesn't come from a store maybe christmas perhaps means a little bit more [Music] and what happened then well in whoville they say that the grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day and the minute his heart didn't feel quite so tight he whizzed with his load through the bright morning light and he brought back the toys and the food for the feast and he he himself the grinch carved the roast beast what a wonderful story i'm so glad that our friend the grinch had a change of heart if you do something nice for someone this holiday season share it using the hashtag grow your heart to be part of the good deeds random house kids and the grinch are doing with feeding america come back for more brightly story time soon or find books to read

{"page": 85, "lesson": 6, "title": "What really happened during the Salem Witch Trials - Brian A. Pavlac", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-really-happened-during-the-salem-witch-trials-brian-a-pavlac", "transcript": {"en": "You’ve been accused of a crime \nyou did not commit. It’s impossible to prove your innocence. If you insist that you’re innocent anyway, you’ll likely be found guilty \nand executed. But if you confess, apologize, \nand implicate others for good measure, you’ll go free. Do you give a false confession— \nor risk a public hanging? This was the choice facing \nthose accused of witchcraft in the village of Salem, Massachusetts \nbetween February 1692 and May 1693. They were the victims of paranoia \nabout the supernatural, misdirected religious fervor— and a justice system that valued \nrepentance over truth. Salem was settled in 1626 by Puritans, \na group of English protestants. Life was strict and isolated \nfor the people of Salem. Battles with their \nNative American neighbors and groups of French settlers\nwere commonplace. People feared starvation and disease, and relations between villagers \nwere strained. To make matters worse, 1692 brought \none of the coldest winters on record. That winter, two cousins, 9 year old Betty Parris and \n11 year old Abigail Williams started behaving very strangely. A physician found nothing \nphysically wrong — but diagnosed the girls \nas under “an evil hand.” Puritans believed that the Devil wreaked \nhavoc in the world through human agents, or witches, who blighted nature, \nconjured fiendish apparitions, and tormented children. As news swept through the village, \nthe symptoms appeared to spread. Accounts describe 12 so-called \n“afflicted” girls contorting their bodies, having fits, \nand complaining of prickling skin. Four of the girls soon accused three\nlocal women of tormenting them. All three of the accused were considered \noutsiders in some way. On February 29th, \nthe authorities arrested Sarah Good, a poor pregnant mother \nof a young daughter, Sarah Osbourne,\nwho had long been absent from church and was suing the family \nof one of her accusers, and Tituba, an enslaved woman \nin Betty Parris’s home known by her first name only. Tituba denied harming the girls at first. But then she confessed to practicing \nwitchcraft on the Devil’s orders, and charged Good and Osbourne \nwith having forced her. Osbourne and Good both \nmaintained their innocence. Osbourne died in prison, while Good’s \nhusband turned against her in court, testifying that she \"was a witch \nor would be one very quickly.\" Good’s 4 year old daughter \nwas imprisoned and eventually gave testimony \nagainst her mother. Meanwhile, Good gave birth in jail. Her baby died, and she was convicted \nand hanged shortly thereafter. Tituba was held in custody until May,\nand then released. These three victims were \njust the beginning. As accusations multiplied, \nothers, like Tituba, made false confession to save themselves. The authorities even reportedly \ntold one accused witch that she would be hanged if she did not \nconfess, and freed if she did. They were not particularly interested\nin thoroughly investigating the charges— in keeping with their Church’s teachings, \nthey preferred that the accused confessed, asked for forgiveness, and promised \nnot to engage in more witchcraft. The court accepted all kinds \nof dubious evidence, including so-called “spectral evidence” in which the girls began raving when \nsupposedly touched by invisible ghosts. Complicating matters further, \nmany of the jurors in the trials were relatives of the accusers,\ncompromising their objectivity. Those who dared to speak out, \nsuch as Judge Nathanial Saltonstall, came under suspicion. By the spring of 1693, \nover a hundred people had been imprisoned, and 14 women \nand 6 men had been executed. By this time, accusations were starting \nto spread beyond Salem to neighboring communities, and even \nthe most powerful figures were targets. When his own wife was accused, the governor of Massachusetts colony \nsuspended the trials. Sentences were amended, \nprisoners released, and arrests stopped.

{"page": 85, "lesson": 11, "title": "What’s the point(e) of ballet? - Ming Luke", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-s-the-point-e-of-ballet-ming-luke", "transcript": {"en": "A baby cursed at birth. \nA fierce battle of good and evil. A true love awoken with a kiss. Sleeping Beauty is one of the world’s \nfavorite folktales. But one of its most famous renditions\ntells the story without a single word. Since premiering in 1890, \"The Sleeping Beauty\" has become one of the most frequently staged \nballets in history. So what makes this piece so beloved? And what exactly does ballet bring \nto this— or any other story? At the heart of ballet \nare dozens of gestures that dancers painstakingly perfect\nover thousands of hours of practice. This unique set of gestures \nhas been used for centuries, each movement rich with meaning \nand history. But you don’t need to study them \nto understand ballet, any more than you need to study \nmusic to be moved by a song. And just as composers combine notes \nand phrases to form pieces of music, choreographers string these gestures \ntogether with new movements to form expressive combinations. Working alongside the orchestra’s \nlive score, ballerinas precisely perform these \ncombinations to convey narrative, emotion, and character. In \"The Sleeping Beauty’s\" opening scene, a flurry of techniques depicts \nthe fairy court bestowing gifts on baby Princess Aurora. The Fairy of Generosity \ndelicately walks “en pointe”— meaning on the tips of her toes— in step with the light plucking \nof violins. The ballerina moves in perfect harmony \nwith the music, even mimicing the violins’ trill \nwith an elegant bourrée. The Fairy of Temperance, bestowing \nthe gift of strong will on Aurora, is choreographed as if shooting bolts \nof electricity from her fingers. She bounds across the stage, spinning with quick chaînés \nbefore decisively jetéing. Some movements are even more literal \nthan this. The evil fairy Carabosse curses \nthe princess with a lethal “X,” and the benevolent Lilac Fairy \ncounters that curse. Of course, the relationship \nbetween music and movement isn’t always this straightforward. While classical ballet gestures \noften respond to musical elements, the degree to which the dancers \nand orchestra align is another choreographic tool. Some characters and scenes move \nin sync to create rhythmic clarity, while others deliberately diverge \nfrom the orchestra. Dancers and musicians maintain \nthis delicate balance throughout each performance, engaging in a live negotiation \nof speed and rhythm. But prior to the performance, \na ballet’s most important relationship is between the choreographer \nand the music. Choreographer Marius Petipa \nand composer Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky worked together on every second \nof \"The Sleeping Beauty.\" This is particularly noticeable \nin Princess Aurora’s exuberant entrance on her 16th birthday. Tchaikovsky’s enthusiastic music \ntumbles forward in fits and starts, even cutting short some musical \nphrases to capture her impatience. Petipa choreographs Aurora bouncing \nback and forth with “pas de chat”— French for \"cat steps\"— \nas she waits for her party to begin. Once the celebration starts,\nit’s up to the dancers to deliver on the physical spectacle of performing\nthese gestures with grace. Aurora has the hardest part of all: \nher famous Rose Adagio. As four suitors vie for her hand, the Princess performs a dizzying array \nof balances, all en pointe. She briefly takes each suitor’s hand, \nbut then balances unassisted— a breath-taking display \nof physical strength and skill. However, it’s not just technique \nthat carries meaning, but also style and personality. Like an actor delivering their lines, ballerinas can execute their movements\nto convey a wide range of emotion. Aurora can be elegant and restrained, throwing her arms in independence \nfrom her suitors. Or she can be coy and flirtatious,\ndescending from en pointe with grace and knowing confidence. \"The Sleeping Beauty\" offers a showcase\nfor so much of what ballet can do. Its graceful spectacle, \ndramatic physical vocabulary, and enchanting coordination \nof music and movement perfectly reflect the themes \nof this fantastical romance. But ballet isn’t just for epic fairytales. Ballets can be non-narrative \nemotional journeys, experimental deconstructions of form, or pure demonstrations of skill. The artform is always experimenting \nwith a centuries old set of rules, making it the perfect medium \nfor stories old and new."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Prior to a performance the most important relationship in ballet is between the __________ and the music:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Conductor"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ballerina"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Choreographer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Orchestra Musicians"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When a ballerina is dancing on the tips of their toes, it is called ____________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "en pointe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "demi-pointe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "first position"}, {"label": "D", "text": "plié"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The individual movements that have been passed down for centuries in the ballet tradition and can be strung together in choreography are called ____________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "notes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "gestures"}, {"label": "C", "text": "combinations"}, {"label": "D", "text": "none of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Working with the orchestra, ballerinas perform combinations of gestures to convey which elements of a story?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "animation, theme and variation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "rising action, climax and resolution"}, {"label": "C", "text": "dialogue, expression and voice projection"}, {"label": "D", "text": "narrative, emotion and character"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The famous “Rose Adagio” scene from The Sleeping Beaty requires particular physical prowess from Aurora, the princess, because she must _________", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "balance unassisted en pointe over and over"}, {"label": "B", "text": "stay in a plié position for an extended time"}, {"label": "C", "text": "do a long series of fouette turns"}, {"label": "D", "text": "jump very high in the air"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

On February 14, 2018, my school experienced one of the worst\nmass school shootings in American history. People want to know what we saw, what I felt. I don't remember everything, but I do remember I went into crisis mode, mother mode. There was no emotion. I lined up the kids, I held up a sign so they could\nfollow me through the hall, just like a fire drill. I heard shots from one direction. Luckily, we were already\nmoving in the opposite direction. We made it outside. We made it to safety. I called my mother. \"I'm OK.\" I called my husband. \"I'm OK.\" Then my daughter called, my voice cracked,\nand I knew I had to pull myself together. I sat alone in my thoughts, worried about my colleagues and students. We sat there, only understanding\nthat somehow, Valentine's Day -- We sat there, only understanding\nthat somehow, Valentine's Day had ended up with our babies dead, and we didn't know what to do next. It's been two months, and every day I still hear the echoes\nof the \"pop, pop\" sound of the gunfire. I remember the fearful faces\nof my students when we knew it wasn't a drill. Still, there's no constant emotion, except for flashes\nof pain, grief and anger triggered by the news, or an insensitive comment, or just silence. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School\nlost 17 precious lives on that horrible day. After, students asked us, the adults the hardest question: How can we stop the senseless violence? This was the most difficult\nquestion I've been asked. But it was not the first time\nI've been humbled by a student's question. I've been teaching\nin the public schools for 33 years, so I know you have to admit\nwhat you don't know before you can share what you do know. In fact, there's a method\nto being an engaged student, teacher, citizen. First, listen closely\nto the person asking you a question. Second, admit your vulnerability.\nAdmit what you don't know. Third, do your homework. Fourth, humbly share your knowledge. I know all about this process. My students ask really\nthoughtful questions all the time. They're eager to learn, and sometimes they're eager\nto prove their smarts. And believe me, they know\nwhen I have no idea of the answer, so in those instances, I say to them, \"That's a great question.\nLet me research that and get back to you.\" So when my students asked, \"How do we stop this senseless violence?\" I listened, and then I admitted, \"I don't know.\" And like I always do when I don't know\nthe answer to one of my questions, I began doing my homework. And as a history teacher, I knew I needed to start\nwith the Second Amendment and the NRA. In case it's been a while since\nyou've been sitting in a history class, here is what the Second Amendment actually says: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State, the right of the people\nto keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\" Meaning, the federal government could not\ninfringe on the rights of citizens to participate in well-regulated militias. The Second Amendment\nwas ratified 226 years ago. It was written in a time before\nthe federal government's armed forces were among the most powerful in the world and when state militias were viewed\nas necessary to protect the states. Fast-forward 80 years, to 1871. The American Civil War\nhad ended a few years prior, but a couple of Union officers had witnessed some pretty shoddy\nmarksmanship on the battlefield. So in an attempt to prepare their men\nfor any future conflicts, they founded the National\nRifle Association to promote rifle practice. In short, the Second Amendment\nwas written to ensure that our newly formed and fragile country had access to organized state militias. And the NRA's original mission was\nto ensure future soldiers had good aim. Someone could teach an entire course on how the next 150 years influenced\nthe gun regulation conversations we're having in the United States and our interpretation\nof the Second Amendment. Almost every pivotal moment\nin our nation's history in one way or another influenced how we as a people manufacture, debate,\nregulate and feel about guns. A lot of change has occurred. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until 2008 that the Supreme Court\nruled for the first time the Second Amendment protects\nan individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm\nfor traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home. Within the home. This change over time is striking to me, because it reminds us that the interpretation\nof the Second Amendment and cultural attitudes about guns have changed over time. Which gives me hope\nthey could change again. (Applause) It's an incredibly complex\nand dynamic history lesson, but it's not the lesson\nI'm here to teach today, because we don't have time. I'm not talking about time, the time that I have here\nto stand and speak. I'm talking about the fact\nwe don't have time to lose. According to the CDC, over the last five years, on average, each day 96 people\nare killed by guns in the United States, and if we don't figure out how to answer\nmy students' question soon, one of us could be next. So, if the question is,\nhow do we stop this senseless violence, the best way I can think to answer is to look at multiple choice. You remember multiple-choice\nquestions in high school, don't you? Let's start. Choice A: this will end when we\nhold gun manufacturers responsible for the deadliness of their products. It might surprise you to learn that we've\nactually thought about this before. Between 1998 and 2000, 30 counties and cities\nsued gun manufacturers, saying they should\nmake their products safer and do a better job of tracking\nwhere their products are sold. In response, manufacturers argued that they had no direct liability\nfor how their products were used. They said the stores who sold the guns\nand the owners who bought them were responsible\nshould anything bad happen. In response to this\nand many other lawsuits, the NRA lobbied\nfor the passage of the PLCAA, the Protection of Lawful\nCommerce in Arms Act. The PLCAA passed\nwith bipartisan support in 2005 and entrusts gun manufacturers to design guns safely, stores to sell those guns responsibly and someone to own\nand use the gun responsibly. And so when 17 students\nand faculty die at my school, no one in this chain\nwill assume responsibility. Let's take a look at another option, Choice B: this will end when we\nhold ourselves accountable and regulate the estimated\n300 million guns available in America. Yes, voting is one of the best ways to take personal responsibility\nfor gun violence. Making sure that our lawmakers\nare willing to pass commonsense gun reform is one of the most effective ways to get\nthose 300 million guns under control. And also, gun owners\ncan take personal initiative. If you own a gun, ask yourself: Do I have an extra gun I don't need? Could it fall into the wrong hands? Have I attended the latest training? Perhaps as a gun owner, you should also ask whether you have been\ntaking care of your mental health? When it comes to gun violence,\nthe mental health argument falls flat if we don't acknowledge\nour own personal vulnerabilities to mental illness. One in six Americans\nwill struggle with mental illness. If we own a gun, we should be\nrigorously engaged in the upkeep of our emotional well-being so we don't pull a trigger in times of illness. Otherwise, we should\nseriously ask ourselves whether we really have the time\nand attention to own a gun. Perhaps for some of us it's time to lay down our arms. Then we have Choice C: this will end when we do a better job\nof taking care of each other. Many social issues affect\nwhy people buy and use guns. Sixty-two percent of US gun fatalities between 2012 and 2016 were suicides, yet we call people maniacs\nand psychos, shaming them. We are creating barriers\nfor people that need help. Why are we embarrassing each other? Let's make it easier, not harder, for people to access\nbetter mental health care. What else? Sexism, racism\nand poverty affect gun ownership and gun-related fatalities. On average, it's estimated that 50 women\nwere fatally shot each month between 2010 and 2014 due to domestic violence, and women are still dying in their homes. Let's empower women and give our young boys a chance to learn how to work out their conflicts\nand emotions with words, not weapons. And the \"Washington Post\"\nreported that last year, nearly 1,000 people were fatally wounded by on-duty police officers. Talk to Black Lives Matter\nand the police union about that. We need to tackle this. (Applause) At the end of the day, perhaps people won't feel the need to buy and use a gun when they all equally feel safe, healthy, respected and cared for. All right, discussion time is over. It's now time to answer the question. How do we stop this senseless violence? Is it Choice A, Choice B, Choice C? Now, I know what you're all thinking. You remember that\nmultiple-choice questions almost never end\nwith just three possibilities. There's always that fourth,\nChoice D: all of the above. Maybe that's the answer here. Or maybe \"all of the above\" is too easy,\nand this is not an easy problem. It requires deep analytical\nthinking by all of us. So instead, I'm asking you\nto do your homework, write your own Choice D using supporting detail. And if you're not sure where to start,\nlook to my students as role models. They are armed with incredible\ncommunication skills and a sense of citizenship\nthat I find so inspiring. (Applause) These are public school kids\nengaged in the issue of gun regulation, and their endeavor has moved our hearts. And they shouldn't have\nto do this on their own. They're asking you, they're asking all of us, to get involved. This isn't a spectator sport. So what's the right answer? I don't know. Listen,\nI'm no gun control expert. I teach the humanities. To be human is to learn, and to be part of a civilization\nis to share your knowledge. This kind of honest,\nbrave and sincere engagement is what I ask of my students, what I expect of myself as a teacher and what I demand of you now. Every one of you\nneeds to do your homework. And then what? Humbly share your knowledge\nwith each other. Please teach your family, teach your community, your city council, your state legislature. Teach Congress a lesson. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Thank you.

Now, one thing about being a twin is, it makes you an expert\nat spotting favoritism. If his cookie was even\nslightly bigger than my cookie, I had questions. And clearly, I wasn't starving. (Laughter) When I became a psychologist,\nI began to notice favoritism of a different kind; and that is, how much more we value\nthe body than we do the mind. I spent nine years at university\nearning my doctorate in psychology, and I can't tell you how many people\nlook at my business card and say, \"Oh -- a psychologist.\nSo, not a real doctor,\" as if it should say that on my card. [Dr. Guy Winch, Just a Psychologist\n(Not a Real Doctor)] (Laughter) This favoritism we show the body\nover the mind -- I see it everywhere. I recently was at a friend's house, and their five-year-old\nwas getting ready for bed. He was standing on a stool\nby the sink, brushing his teeth, when he slipped and scratched his leg\non the stool when he fell. He cried for a minute,\nbut then he got back up, got back on the stool, and reached out\nfor a box of Band-Aids to put one on his cut. Now, this kid could barely\ntie his shoelaces, but he knew you have to cover a cut\nso it doesn't become infected, and you have to care for your teeth\nby brushing twice a day. We all know how to maintain\nour physical health and how to practice dental hygiene, right? We've known it since\nwe were five years old. But what do we know about maintaining\nour psychological health? Well, nothing. What do we teach our children\nabout emotional hygiene? Nothing. How is it that we spend more time\ntaking care of our teeth than we do our minds? Why is it that our physical health\nis so much more important to us than our psychological health? We sustain psychological injuries\neven more often than we do physical ones, injuries like failure\nor rejection or loneliness. And they can also get worse\nif we ignore them, and they can impact our lives\nin dramatic ways. And yet, even though there are\nscientifically proven techniques we could use to treat these\nkinds of psychological injuries, we don't. It doesn't even occur to us\nthat we should. \"Oh, you're feeling depressed?\nJust shake it off; it's all in your head.\" Can you imagine saying that\nto somebody with a broken leg: \"Oh, just walk it off;\nit's all in your leg.\" (Laughter) It is time we closed the gap between our physical\nand our psychological health. It's time we made them more equal, more like twins. Speaking of which,\nmy brother is also a psychologist. So he's not a real doctor, either. (Laughter) We didn't study together, though. In fact, the hardest thing\nI've ever done in my life is move across the Atlantic\nto New York City to get my doctorate in psychology. We were apart then\nfor the first time in our lives, and the separation was brutal\nfor both of us. But while he remained\namong family and friends, I was alone in a new country. We missed each other terribly, but international phone calls\nwere really expensive then, and we could only afford to speak\nfor five minutes a week. When our birthday rolled around, it was the first\nwe wouldn't be spending together. We decided to splurge, and that week,\nwe would talk for 10 minutes. (Laughter) I spent the morning pacing around my room,\nwaiting for him to call -- and waiting ... and waiting. But the phone didn't ring. Given the time difference, I assumed, \"OK, he's out with friends,\nhe'll call later.\" There were no cell phones then. But he didn't. And I began to realize\nthat after being away for over 10 months, he no longer missed me\nthe way I missed him. I knew he would call in the morning, but that night was one of the saddest\nand longest nights of my life. I woke up the next morning. I glanced down at the phone, and I realized\nI had kicked it off the hook when pacing the day before. I stumbled out of bed, I put the phone back on the receiver,\nand it rang a second later. And it was my brother, and boy, was he pissed. (Laughter) It was the saddest and longest\nnight of his life as well. Now, I tried to explain\nwhat happened, but he said, \"I don't understand. If you saw I wasn't calling you, why didn't you just pick up\nthe phone and call me?\" He was right. Why didn't I call him? I didn't have an answer then. But I do today, and it's a simple one: loneliness. Loneliness creates a deep\npsychological wound, one that distorts our perceptions\nand scrambles our thinking. It makes us believe that those around us\ncare much less than they actually do. It make us really afraid to reach out, because why set yourself up\nfor rejection and heartache when your heart is already aching\nmore than you can stand? I was in the grips\nof real loneliness back then, but I was surrounded by people all day,\nso it never occurred to me. But loneliness is defined\npurely subjectively. It depends solely on whether you feel\nemotionally or socially disconnected from those around you. And I did. There is a lot of research on loneliness,\nand all of it is horrifying. Loneliness won't just make you miserable; it will kill you. I'm not kidding. Chronic loneliness increases\nyour likelihood of an early death by 14 percent. Fourteen percent! Loneliness causes high blood pressure, high cholesterol. It even suppress the functioning\nof your immune system, making you vulnerable to all kinds\nof illnesses and diseases. In fact, scientists have concluded\nthat taken together, chronic loneliness\nposes as significant a risk for your long-term health and longevity as cigarette smoking. Now, cigarette packs come with warnings\nsaying, \"This could kill you.\" But loneliness doesn't. And that's why it's so important that we prioritize\nour psychological health, that we practice emotional hygiene. Because you can't treat\na psychological wound if you don't even know you're injured. Loneliness isn't the only\npsychological wound that distorts our perceptions\nand misleads us. Failure does that as well. I once visited a day care center, where I saw three toddlers\nplay with identical plastic toys. You had to slide the red button,\nand a cute doggie would pop out. One little girl tried pulling\nthe purple button, then pushing it, and then she just sat back\nand looked at the box with her lower lip trembling. The little boy next to her\nwatched this happen, then turned to his box and burst\ninto tears without even touching it. Meanwhile, another little girl\ntried everything she could think of until she slid the red button, the cute doggie popped out,\nand she squealed with delight. So: three toddlers\nwith identical plastic toys, but with very different\nreactions to failure. The first two toddlers were perfectly\ncapable of sliding a red button. The only thing that prevented\nthem from succeeding was that their mind tricked them\ninto believing they could not. Now, adults get tricked this way\nas well, all the time. In fact, we all have a default set\nof feelings and beliefs that gets triggered whenever\nwe encounter frustrations and setbacks. Are you aware of how\nyour mind reacts to failure? You need to be. Because if your mind tries to convince you\nyou're incapable of something, and you believe it, then like those two toddlers,\nyou'll begin to feel helpless and you'll stop trying too soon,\nor you won't even try at all. And then you'll be even more\nconvinced you can't succeed. You see, that's why so many people\nfunction below their actual potential. Because somewhere along the way,\nsometimes a single failure convinced them that they couldn't\nsucceed, and they believed it. Once we become convinced of something,\nit's very difficult to change our mind. I learned that lesson the hard way\nwhen I was a teenager with my brother. We were driving with friends\ndown a dark road at night, when a police car stopped us. There had been a robbery in the area\nand they were looking for suspects. The officer approached the car,\nand shined his flashlight on the driver, then on my brother in the front seat, and then on me. And his eyes opened wide and he said, \"Where have I seen your face before?\" (Laughter) And I said, \"In the front seat.\" (Laughter) But that made no sense to him whatsoever, so now he thought I was on drugs. (Laughter) So he drags me out of the car,\nhe searches me, he marches me over to the police car, and only when he verified\nI didn't have a police record, could I show him\nI had a twin in the front seat. But even as we were driving away, you could see by the look\non his face he was convinced that I was getting away with something. (Laughter) Our mind is hard to change\nonce we become convinced. So it might be very natural\nto feel demoralized and defeated after you fail. But you cannot allow yourself\nto become convinced you can't succeed. You have to fight\nfeelings of helplessness. You have to gain control\nover the situation. And you have to break\nthis kind of negative cycle before it begins. [Stop Emotional Bleeding] Our minds and our feelings -- they're not the trustworthy friends\nwe thought they were. They're more like a really moody friend, who can be totally supportive one minute,\nand really unpleasant the next. I once worked with this woman\nwho, after 20 years marriage and an extremely ugly divorce, was finally ready for her first date. She had met this guy online, and he seemed nice\nand he seemed successful, and most importantly,\nhe seemed really into her. So she was very excited,\nshe bought a new dress, and they met at an upscale\nNew York City bar for a drink. Ten minutes into the date,\nthe man stands up and says, \"I'm not interested,\" and walks out. Rejection is extremely painful. The woman was so hurt she couldn't move. All she could do was call a friend. Here's what the friend said:\n\"Well, what do you expect? You have big hips,\nyou have nothing interesting to say. Why would a handsome,\nsuccessful man like that ever go out with a loser like you?\" Shocking, right, that a friend\ncould be so cruel? But it would be much less shocking if I told you it wasn't\nthe friend who said that. It's what the woman said to herself. And that's something we all do, especially after a rejection. We all start thinking of all our faults\nand all our shortcomings, what we wish we were,\nwhat we wish we weren't. We call ourselves names. Maybe not as harshly, but we all do it. And it's interesting that we do, because our self-esteem\nis already hurting. Why would we want to go\nand damage it even further? We wouldn't make a physical injury\nworse on purpose. You wouldn't get a cut on your arm\nand decide, \"Oh! I know -- I'm going to take a knife and see\nhow much deeper I can make it.\" But we do that with psychological\ninjuries all the time. Why? Because of poor emotional hygiene. Because we don't prioritize\nour psychological health. We know from dozens of studies\nthat when your self-esteem is lower, you are more vulnerable\nto stress and to anxiety; that failures and rejections hurt more, and it takes longer to recover from them. So when you get rejected,\nthe first thing you should be doing is to revive your self-esteem, not join Fight Club\nand beat it into a pulp. When you're in emotional pain, treat yourself with the same compassion you would expect from a truly good friend. [Protect Your Self-Esteem] We have to catch our unhealthy\npsychological habits and change them. And one of unhealthiest and most common\nis called rumination. To ruminate means to chew over. It's when your boss yells at you or your professor\nmakes you feel stupid in class, or you have big fight with a friend and you just can't stop replaying\nthe scene in your head for days, sometimes for weeks on end. Now, ruminating about upsetting events\nin this way can easily become a habit, and it's a very costly one, because by spending so much time focused\non upsetting and negative thoughts, you are actually putting yourself\nat significant risk for developing clinical depression, alcoholism, eating disorders, and even cardiovascular disease. The problem is, the urge to ruminate can feel\nreally strong and really important, so it's a difficult habit to stop. I know this for a fact, because a little over a year ago,\nI developed the habit myself. You see, my twin brother was diagnosed\nwith stage 3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His cancer was extremely aggressive. He had visible tumors all over his body. And he had to start a harsh course\nof chemotherapy. And I couldn't stop thinking\nabout what he was going through. I couldn't stop thinking\nabout how much he was suffering, even though he never complained, not once. He had this incredibly positive attitude. His psychological health was amazing. I was physically healthy,\nbut psychologically, I was a mess. But I knew what to do. Studies tell us that even a two-minute\ndistraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate\nin that moment. And so each time I had a worrying,\nupsetting, negative thought, I forced myself to concentrate\non something else until the urge passed. And within one week,\nmy whole outlook changed and became more positive and more hopeful. [Battle Negative Thinking] Nine weeks after he started chemotherapy,\nmy brother had a CAT scan, and I was by his side\nwhen he got the results. All the tumors were gone. He still had three more rounds\nof chemotherapy to go, but we knew he would recover. This picture was taken two weeks ago. By taking action when you're lonely, by changing your responses to failure, by protecting your self-esteem, by battling negative thinking, you won't just heal\nyour psychological wounds, you will build emotional resilience, you will thrive. A hundred years ago, people began\npracticing personal hygiene, and life expectancy rates\nrose by over 50 percent in just a matter of decades. I believe our quality of life\ncould rise just as dramatically if we all began practicing\nemotional hygiene. Can you imagine\nwhat the world would be like if everyone was psychologically healthier? If there were less loneliness\nand less depression? If people knew how to overcome failure? If they felt better about themselves\nand more empowered? If they were happier and more fulfilled? I can, because that's the world\nI want to live in. And that's the world\nmy brother wants to live in as well. And if you just become informed\nand change a few simple habits, well -- that's the world we can all live in. Thank you very much.

{"page": 85, "lesson": 14, "title": "Teach girls bravery, not perfection - Reshma Saujani", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/teach-girls-bravery-not-perfection-reshma-saujani", "transcript": {"en": "So a few years ago, I did something really brave, or some would say really stupid. I ran for Congress. For years, I had existed\nsafely behind the scenes in politics as a fundraiser, as an organizer, but in my heart, I always wanted to run. The sitting congresswoman\nhad been in my district since 1992. She had never lost a race, and no one had really even run against her\nin a Democratic primary. But in my mind, this was my way to make a difference, to disrupt the status quo. The polls, however,\ntold a very different story. My pollsters told me\nthat I was crazy to run, that there was no way that I could win. But I ran anyway, and in 2012, I became an upstart\nin a New York City congressional race. I swore I was going to win. I had the endorsement\nfrom the New York Daily News, the Wall Street Journal\nsnapped pictures of me on election day, and CNBC called it one of the hottest\nraces in the country. I raised money from everyone I knew, including Indian aunties that were just so happy\nan Indian girl was running. But on election day, the polls were right, and I only got 19 percent of the vote, and the same papers\nthat said I was a rising political star now said I wasted 1.3 million dollars on 6,321 votes. Don't do the math. It was humiliating. Now, before you get the wrong idea, this is not a talk\nabout the importance of failure. Nor is it about leaning in. I tell you the story\nof how I ran for Congress because I was 33 years old and it was the first time\nin my entire life that I had done something\nthat was truly brave, where I didn't worry about being perfect. And I'm not alone: so many women I talk to tell me that they gravitate\ntowards careers and professions that they know\nthey're going to be great in, that they know they're\ngoing to be perfect in, and it's no wonder why. Most girls are taught\nto avoid risk and failure. We're taught to smile pretty, play it safe, get all A's. Boys, on the other hand, are taught to play rough, swing high, crawl to the top of the monkey bars\nand then just jump off headfirst. And by the time they're adults, whether they're negotiating a raise\nor even asking someone out on a date, they're habituated\nto take risk after risk. They're rewarded for it. It's often said in Silicon Valley, no one even takes you seriously\nunless you've had two failed start-ups. In other words, we're raising our girls to be perfect, and we're raising our boys to be brave. Some people worry\nabout our federal deficit, but I, I worry about our bravery deficit. Our economy, our society,\nwe're just losing out because we're not raising\nour girls to be brave. The bravery deficit is why\nwomen are underrepresented in STEM, in C-suites, in boardrooms, in Congress, and pretty much everywhere you look. In the 1980s, psychologist Carol Dweck looked at how bright fifth graders\nhandled an assignment that was too difficult for them. She found that bright girls\nwere quick to give up. The higher the IQ,\nthe more likely they were to give up. Bright boys, on the other hand, found the difficult material\nto be a challenge. They found it energizing. They were more likely\nto redouble their efforts. What's going on? Well, at the fifth grade level, girls routinely outperform boys\nin every subject, including math and science, so it's not a question of ability. The difference is in how boys\nand girls approach a challenge. And it doesn't just end in fifth grade. An HP report found\nthat men will apply for a job if they meet only 60 percent\nof the qualifications, but women, women will apply only if they meet 100 percent\nof the qualifications. 100 percent. This study is usually invoked\nas evidence that, well, women need a little more confidence. But I think it's evidence that women have been socialized\nto aspire to perfection, and they're overly cautious. (Applause) And even when we're ambitious, even when we're leaning in, that socialization of perfection has caused us to take\nless risks in our careers. And so those 600,000 jobs\nthat are open right now in computing and tech, women are being left behind, and it means our economy\nis being left behind on all the innovation and problems\nwomen would solve if they were socialized to be brave instead of socialized to be perfect. (Applause) So in 2012, I started a company\nto teach girls to code, and what I found\nis that by teaching them to code I had socialized them to be brave. Coding, it's an endless process\nof trial and error, of trying to get the right command\nin the right place, with sometimes just a semicolon making the difference\nbetween success and failure. Code breaks and then it falls apart, and it often takes many, many tries until that magical moment when what you're trying\nto build comes to life. It requires perseverance. It requires imperfection. We immediately see in our program our girls' fear of not getting it right, of not being perfect. Every Girls Who Code teacher\ntells me the same story. During the first week,\nwhen the girls are learning how to code, a student will call her over\nand she'll say, \"I don't know what code to write.\" The teacher will look at her screen, and she'll see a blank text editor. If she didn't know any better,\nshe'd think that her student spent the past 20 minutes\njust staring at the screen. But if she presses undo a few times, she'll see that her student\nwrote code and then deleted it. She tried, she came close, but she didn't get it exactly right. Instead of showing\nthe progress that she made, she'd rather show nothing at all. Perfection or bust. It turns out that our girls\nare really good at coding, but it's not enough\njust to teach them to code. My friend Lev Brie, who is a professor\nat the University of Columbia and teaches intro to Java tells me about his office hours\nwith computer science students. When the guys are struggling\nwith an assignment, they'll come in and they'll say, \"Professor, there's something\nwrong with my code.\" The girls will come in and say, \"Professor, there's something\nwrong with me.\" We have to begin to undo\nthe socialization of perfection, but we've got to combine it\nwith building a sisterhood that lets girls know\nthat they are not alone. Because trying harder\nis not going to fix a broken system. I can't tell you how many women tell me, \"I'm afraid to raise my hand, I'm afraid to ask a question, because I don't want to be the only one who doesn't understand, the only one who is struggling. When we teach girls to be brave and we have a supportive network\ncheering them on, they will build incredible things, and I see this every day. Take, for instance,\ntwo of our high school students who built a game called Tampon Run -- yes, Tampon Run -- to fight against the menstruation taboo and sexism in gaming. Or the Syrian refugee who dared show her love\nfor her new country by building an app\nto help Americans get to the polls. Or a 16-year-old girl\nwho built an algorithm to help detect whether a cancer\nis benign or malignant in the off chance\nthat she can save her daddy's life because he has cancer. These are just\nthree examples of thousands, thousands of girls who have been\nsocialized to be imperfect, who have learned to keep trying,\nwho have learned perseverance. And whether they become coders or the next Hillary Clinton or Beyoncé, they will not defer their dreams. And those dreams have never been\nmore important for our country. For the American economy,\nfor any economy to grow, to truly innovate, we cannot leave behind\nhalf our population. We have to socialize our girls\nto be comfortable with imperfection, and we've got to do it now. We cannot wait for them\nto learn how to be brave like I did when I was 33 years old. We have to teach them\nto be brave in schools and early in their careers, when it has the most potential\nto impact their lives and the lives of others, and we have to show them\nthat they will be loved and accepted not for being perfect but for being courageous. And so I need each of you\nto tell every young woman you know -- your sister, your niece,\nyour employee, your colleague -- to be comfortable with imperfection, because when we teach\ngirls to be imperfect, and we help them leverage it, we will build a movement\nof young women who are brave and who will build\na better world for themselves and for each and every one of us. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Chris Anderson: Reshma, thank you. It's such a powerful vision you have.\nYou have a vision. Tell me how it's going. How many girls\nare involved now in your program? Reshma Saujani: Yeah.\nSo in 2012, we taught 20 girls. This year we'll teach 40,000\nin all 50 states. (Applause) And that number is really powerful, because last year we only graduated\n7,500 women in computer science. Like, the problem is so bad that we can make\nthat type of change quickly. CA: And you're working with some\nof the companies in this room even, who are welcoming\ngraduates from your program? RS: Yeah, we have about 80 partners, from Twitter to Facebook to Adobe to IBM to Microsoft\nto Pixar to Disney, I mean, every single company out there. And if you're not signed up,\nI'm going to find you, because we need every single tech company to embed a Girls Who Code\nclassroom in their office. CA: And you have some stories\nback from some of those companies that when you mix in more gender balance in the engineering teams,\ngood things happen. RS: Great things happen. I mean, I think that it's crazy to me\nto think about the fact that right now 85 percent of all\nconsumer purchases are made by women. Women use social media at a rate\nof 600 percent more than men. We own the Internet, and we should be building\nthe companies of tomorrow.

But before the astronauts \nbegan their final descent, an emergency alarm lit up. Something was overloading \nthe computer, and threatened to abort the landing. Back on Earth, Margaret Hamilton \nheld her breath. She'd led the team developing \nthe pioneering in-flight software, so she knew this mission \nhad no room for error. But the nature \nof this last-second emergency would soon prove her software \nwas working exactly as planned. Born 33 years earlier in Paoli, Indiana, \nHamilton had always been inquisitive. In college, she studied mathematics\nand philosophy, before taking a research position at the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology to pay for grad school. Here, she encountered her first computer\nwhile developing software to support research \ninto the new field of chaos theory. Next at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory, Hamilton developed software \nfor America’s first air defense system to search for enemy aircraft. But when she heard \nthat renowned engineer Charles Draper was looking for help \nsending mankind to the moon, she immediately joined his team. NASA looked to Draper and his group \nof over 400 engineers to invent the first compact \ndigital flight computer, the Apollo Guidance Computer. Using input from astronauts, this device would be responsible \nfor guiding, navigating and controlling the spacecraft. At a time when unreliable computers \nfilled entire rooms, the AGC needed to operate \nwithout any errors, and fit in one cubic foot of space. Draper divided the lab into two teams, one for designing hardware \nand one for developing software. Hamilton led the team that built \nthe on-board flight software for both the Command and Lunar Modules. This work, for which she coined the term\n“software engineering,\" was incredibly high stakes. Human lives were on the line, \nso every program had to be perfect. Margaret’s software needed to quickly\ndetect unexpected errors and recover from them in real time. But this kind of adaptable program \nwas difficult to build, since early software could only process \njobs in a predetermined order. To solve this problem, Margaret designed her program \nto be “asynchronous,” meaning the software's more important\njobs would interrupt less important ones. Her team assigned every task \na unique priority to ensure that each job \noccurred in the correct order and at the right time—\nregardless of any surprises. After this breakthrough, Margaret realized her software \ncould help the astronauts work in an asynchronous environment as well. She designed Priority Displays that would interrupt \nastronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies. The astronaut could then communicate\nwith Mission Control to determine the best path forward. This marked the first time flight software\ncommunicated directly— and asynchronously— \nwith a pilot. It was these fail safes that triggered \nthe alarms just before the lunar landing. Buzz Aldrin quickly realized his mistake— he’d inadvertently flipped \nthe rendezvous radar switch. This radar would be essential \non their journey home, but here it was using up \nvital computational resources. Fortunately, the Apollo Guidance Computer\nwas well equipped to manage this. During the overload, \nthe software restart programs allowed only the highest priority jobs \nto be processed— including the programs \nnecessary for landing. The Priority Displays \ngave the astronauts a choice— to land or not to land. With minutes to spare, \nMission Control gave the order. The Apollo 11 landing was about \nthe astronauts, Mission Control, software and hardware all working together\nas an integrated system of systems. Hamilton’s contributions were essential\nto the work of engineers and scientists inspired by President John F. Kennedy’s \ngoal to reach the Moon. And her life-saving work \nwent far beyond Apollo 11— no bugs were ever found in the in-flight\nsoftware for any crewed Apollo missions. After her work on Apollo, Hamilton founded a company that uses \nits unique universal systems language to create breakthroughs \nfor systems and software. In 2003, NASA honored her achievements \nwith the largest financial award they’d ever given to an individual. And 47 years after her software\nfirst guided astronauts to the moon, Hamilton was awarded \nthe Presidential Medal of Freedom for changing the way we think \nabout technology."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Margaret’s Hamilton was born in ________, ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Akron, Ohio"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Detroit, Michigan"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Erie, Indiana"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Paoli, Indiana"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "400 scientists including Margaret Hamilton worked on the ____________ at MIT to help send people to the Moon.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Apollo Guidance Computer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Asynchronous Radio Detector"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Air Defense System"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lunar Radar Computer"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Margaret’s computer software had to be __________, meaning the software’s more important jobs could interrupt less important ones.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Asynchronous"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chronological"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Compact"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Synchronous"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The _________ would interrupt astronaut’s regularly scheduled tasks to warn them of emergencies.

Carrying a baby, she headed \nfor the nearest village to beg for food. She approached a magnificent mansion, but the mistress of the house \ntook one look at her grimy clothes and unusual companions \nand slammed the door in her face. So she continued down the road \nuntil she came to a cottage. The woman there took pity on the stranger\nand offered her what she could: a simple meal and a bed of straw. Her guest was no ordinary beggar. She was Isis, \nthe most powerful goddess in Egypt. Isis was in hiding from her brother Set, who murdered her husband and wanted \nto murder her infant son, Horus. Set was also a powerful god, \nand he was looking for them. So to keep her cover, \nIsis had to be very discreet— she couldn’t risk using her powers. But she was not without aid. Serket, goddess of venomous creatures, had sent seven of her fiercest servants \nto guard Isis and her son. As Isis and Horus settled \ninto their humble accommodation, the scorpions fumed at how the wealthy\nwoman had offended their divine mistress. They all combined their venom \nand gave it to one of the seven, Tefen. In the dead of night, \nTefen crept over to the mansion. As he crawled under the door, he saw the owner’s young son \nsleeping peacefully and gave him a mighty sting. Isis and her hostess were soon awakened\nby loud wailing. As they peered out of the doorway \nof the cottage, they saw a mother running \nthrough the street, weeping as she cradled her son. When Isis recognized the woman \nwho had turned her away, she understood what her \nscorpions had done. Isis took the boy in her arms \nand began to recite a powerful spell: \"O poison of Tefen, come out of him \nand fall upon the ground! Poison of Befen, advance not, \npenetrate no farther, come out of him, and fall upon the ground! For I am Isis, the great Enchantress, \nthe Speaker of spells. Fall down, O poison of Mestet! \nHasten not, poison of Mestetef! Rise not, poison of Petet and Thetet! \nApproach not, poison of Matet!\" With each name she invoked, \nthat scorpion’s poison was neutralized. The child stirred, \nand his mother wept with gratitude and lamented her earlier callousness, offering all her wealth \nto Isis in repentance. The woman who had taken Isis in \nwatched in awe— she had had no idea who she’d brought\nunder her roof. And from that day on, the people learned to make a poultice \nto treat scorpion bites, speaking magical incantations \njust as the goddess had."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where was Isis hiding?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Swamp"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Desert"}, {"label": "C", "text": "River"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the name of her infant son?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Set"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Matet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Horus"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What was Serket the goddess of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Harvests"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Venomous creatures"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hospitality"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which scorpion received the venom of all the others?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Petet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Befen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tefen"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How did Isis neutralize the scorpions’ venom?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By calling their divine names"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By killing the scorpions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By purifying the child in fire"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 85, "lesson": 18, "title": "Do politics make us irrational? - Jay Van Bavel", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/do-politics-make-us-irrational-jay-van-bavel", "transcript": {"en": "In 2013, a team of researchers \nheld a math test. The exam was administered \nto over 1,100 American adults, and designed, in part, to test \ntheir ability to evaluate sets of data. Hidden among these math problems \nwere two almost identical questions. Both problems \nused the same difficult data set, and each had one objectively \ncorrect answer. The first asked about the correlation \nbetween rashes and a new skin cream. The second asked about the correlation \nbetween crime rates and gun control legislation. Participants with strong math skills were much more likely \nto get the first question correct. But despite being \nmathematically identical, the results for the second question \nlooked totally different. Here, math skills \nweren’t the best predictor of which participants answered correctly. Instead, another variable the researchers \nhad been tracking came into play: political identity. Participants whose political beliefs aligned with a correct interpretation \nof the data were far more likely \nto answer the problem right. Even the study’s top mathematicians were 45% more likely \nto get the second question wrong when the correct answer \nchallenged their political beliefs. What is it about politics that inspires \nthis kind of illogical error? Can someone’s political identity \nactually affect their ability to process information? The answer lies in a cognitive phenomenon that has become increasingly visible \nin public life: partisanship. While it’s often invoked \nin the context of politics, partisanship is more broadly defined \nas a strong preference or bias towards any particular group or idea. Our political, ethnic, religious, \nand national identities are all different forms of partisanship. Of course, identifying with social groups is an essential and healthy part \nof human life. Our sense of self is defined not only by \nwho we are as individuals, but also by the groups we belong to. As a result, we’re strongly motivated \nto defend our group identities, protecting both our sense of self \nand our social communities. But this becomes a problem \nwhen the group’s beliefs are at odds with reality. Imagine watching your favorite sports team\ncommit a serious foul. You know that’s against the rules, but your fellow fans \nthink it’s totally acceptable. The tension between \nthese two incompatible thoughts is called cognitive dissonance, and most people are driven to resolve \nthis uncomfortable state of limbo. You might start to blame the referee, \ncomplain that the other team started it, or even convince yourself \nthere was no foul in the first place. In a case like this, people are often more motivated \nto maintain a positive relationship with their group \nthan perceive the world accurately. This behavior \nis especially dangerous in politics. On an individual scale, allegiance to a party allows people \nto create a political identity and support policies they agree with. But partisan-based cognitive dissonance \ncan lead people to reject evidence that’s inconsistent with the party line \nor discredits party leaders. And when entire groups of people revise \nthe facts in service of partisan beliefs, it can lead to policies \nthat aren’t grounded in truth or reason. This problem isn’t new— political identities \nhave been around for centuries. But studies show \nthat partisan polarization has increased dramatically \nin the last few decades. One theory explaining this increase is the trend towards clustering \ngeographically in like-minded communities. Another is the growing tendency \nto rely on partisan news or social media bubbles. These often act like echo chambers, delivering news and ideas \nfrom people with similar views. Fortunately, cognitive scientists \nhave uncovered some strategies for resisting this distortion filter. One is to remember that you’re probably \nmore biased than you think. So when you encounter new information, make a deliberate effort \nto push through your initial intuition and evaluate it analytically. In your own groups, try to make \nfact-checking and questioning assumptions a valued part of the culture. Warning people that they might have been \npresented with misinformation can also help. And when you’re trying \nto persuade someone else, affirming their values \nand framing the issue in their language can help make people more receptive. We still have a long way to go before \nsolving the problem of partisanship. But hopefully, these tools \ncan help keep us better informed, and capable of making evidence-based \ndecisions about our shared reality."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In 2013 a team of researchers examined how people solved identical math problems about non-political (skin cream) and political (gun control) topics.

Stiff", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-cotton-in-everything-michael-r-stiff", "transcript": {"en": "Centuries ago, the Inca developed \ningenuous suits of armor that could flex \nwith the blows of sharp spears and maces, protecting warriors \nfrom even the fiercest physical attacks. These hardy structures \nwere made not from iron or steel, but rather something unexpectedly soft: \ncotton. These thickly woven, \nlayered quilts of cotton could distribute the energy from a blow \nacross a large surface area, shielding warriors \nwithout restricting their mobility. These seemingly contradictory features— strength and flexibility, \nsoftness and durability— have their roots in the intricate biology \nof the nearly invisible cotton fiber. These fibers begin life \ndeep within a cotton flower, on the surface of a seed. As many as 16,000 fibers \nwill festoon a single seed, bulging from the seed’s surface \nlike miniature water balloons. Each cotton fiber, \nno matter how large it grows, is made of just one cell. That cell has multiple layers \nof cell wall. After a few days, \nthe sides of the first layer, called the primary cell wall, stiffen, pushing cell growth \nin one direction and causing the fiber to elongate. The fiber elongates \nquickly for about 16 days. Then it begins the next stage: \nstrengthening the cell wall. It does this by making more \nof the carbohydrate cellulose. Cellulose will make up \n34% of the cell wall at this stage and swiftly increases. This new growth \nalso reinforces the cell wall by going against the grain \nof the existing wall. The strengthened wall is more rigid, \nrestricting further growth. That means if the fiber \nremodels its walls too early, it will be short, and ultimately make rough, weak fabrics. But if cell wall strengthening \nbegins too late, the wall won’t be sturdy enough— producing fibers that are too weak \nto hold fabrics together well. In ideal growing conditions— with the right temperature, water, \nfertilizer, pest control, and light— a cotton fiber can grow \nup to 3.6 centimeters long with only a 25 micrometer width. Long, fine fibers \ncan wrap around one another better than shorter, \nless fine fibers, which means those long, fine fibers \nmake stronger threads that hang together better as fabric. Cotton with these qualities \nhas diverse uses— from soft textiles \nto the U.S. dollar bill, which is 75% cotton. The next crucial stage \nof the cotton fiber’s growth begins as it thickens \nits secondary cell wall by depositing large quantities \nof cellulose into the secondary layer. Cellulose goes on to make up \nover 90% of the fiber’s weight. The more cellulose that gets deposited, the denser that secondary layer becomes— and this determines \nthe strength of the final fiber. This stage is essential \nfor developing long-lasting material for the likes of, say, a t-shirt. The garment’s capacity \nto withstand years of washing and wear is largely determined by the density \nof that secondary cell wall. On the other hand, its softness is strongly influenced \nby the length of the fiber, established with the remodeling \nof the primary wall layer. Finally, after about 50 days, \nthe fiber is fully grown. The living matter \nwithin the cell dies off, leaving behind only the cellulose. The dried cotton seed pod, or boll, \nthat surrounds the fibers cracks open, unveiling a burst of several thousand \nfiber cells in a fluffy mass. The thread-like fibers we see— \nthinner than a human hair— are the remains of those dense, \ndried out walls of cellulose. Tens of thousands of these fibers \nspun into yarn will go on to make everything from fabric,\nto coffee filters, diapers, and fishing nets. And with the help of modern science, cotton might soon be softer, stronger, \nand more resilient than ever as researchers investigate \nhow to optimize its growth based on nutrients, weather conditions, \nand genetics."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In ideal growing conditions, a cotton fiber can grow up to _____ cm long", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1.0"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3.6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2.5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7.5"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The layer of cell wall that allows the cotton fiber to elongate is the _____ cell wall.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "primary"}, {"label": "B", "text": "secondary"}, {"label": "C", "text": "weaker"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stronger"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Cellulose in the cotton fiber wall makes the fiber _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "more flexible"}, {"label": "B", "text": "longer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "weaker"}, {"label": "D", "text": "stronger"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The weight of a fully grown cotton fiber will be _____ cellulose.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "34%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "90%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "99%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Inca warriors were protected in battle due to what quality of the armor?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "flexibility"}, {"label": "B", "text": "camouflage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "rigidity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "heavy"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

(Laughter) And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper\nwould come along, and then I would kind of do this. (Laughter) And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed\nto spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that,\nmy normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had\nto go something like this.

How hard could it be\nto walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. (Laughter) And then -- (Laughter) But then those middle months\nactually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks.

And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven\nnon-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here\nto show you today. I want you to take a look carefully\nto see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not\na trained brain expert, it's not that obvious,\nbut just take a look, OK? So here's the brain\nof a non-procrastinator. (Laughter) Now ... here's my brain. (Laughter) There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational\nDecision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean\nfor the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine\nuntil this happens. [This is a perfect time\nto get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational Decision-Maker\nwill make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, \"Actually, let's read\nthe entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/\nTonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered\nthat that happened. (Laughter) Then -- (Laughter) Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new\nin there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go\non a YouTube spiral that starts with videos\nof Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later\nwith us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. (Laughter) \"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room\non the schedule for any work today. Sorry!\" (Sigh) Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey\ndoes not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past,\nno knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing\nnothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success! (Laughter) And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed\nand propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times\nmight have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed,\nnow we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization,\nand the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have\nanother guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things\nno other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take\nall of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense\nto be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner\nor going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder\nand less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end\na certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time\nin this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely\nout of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. (Laughter) Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators\nout there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities\nare not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun,\nbecause it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt,\ndread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation,\nwith the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get\nhimself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where\nreally important things happen? Well, turns out the procrastinator\nhas a guardian angel, someone who's always looking\ndown on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster. (Laughter) Now, the Panic Monster\nis dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up\nanytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other\nscary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing\nthe Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant\nin my life pretty recently, because the people of TED\nreached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. (Laughter) Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine\nto have done a TED Talk in the past. (Laughter) (Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed\nto have something else on his mind. He was saying, \"Are we clear\non what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now\nhappening one day in the future? We need to sit down\nand work on this right now.\" And the Monkey said, \"Totally agree,\nbut let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India,\nlike 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours\ntil we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India.\" (Laughter) So that's what we did that day. (Laughter) As six months turned into four\nand then two and then one, the people of TED decided\nto release the speakers. And I opened up the website,\nand there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up? (Laughter) So the Panic Monster\nstarts losing his mind, and a few seconds later,\nthe whole system's in mayhem. (Laughter) And the Monkey -- remember,\nhe's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker\ncan take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane\nprocrastinator behavior, like how someone like me\ncould spend two weeks unable to start the opening\nsentence of a paper, and then miraculously find\nthe unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night\nand write eight pages. And this entire situation,\nwith the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about\non the blog a couple of years ago. When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people\nfrom all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses,\nbankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. (Laughter) And they were all writing,\nsaying the same thing: \"I have this problem too.\" But what struck me was the contrast\nbetween the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing\nwith intense frustration about what procrastination\nhad done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system\nworks, then what's going on? Why are all of these people\nin such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's\ntwo kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today,\nthe examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination\nare contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind\nof procrastination that happens in situations\nwhen there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career\nwhere you're a self-starter -- something in the arts,\nsomething entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things\nat first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out\nand done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things\noutside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising\nand taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship\nthat isn't working. Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism\nof doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these\nnon-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination,\nthey're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term\nkind of procrastination that's much less visible\nand much less talked about than the funnier, short-term\ndeadline-based kind. It's usually suffered\nquietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term\nunhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that's why\nthose people are emailing, and that's why they're\nin such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming\nfor some project. It's that long-term procrastination\nhas made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not\nthat they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even\nable to start chasing them. So I read these emails\nand I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think\nnon-procrastinators exist. That's right -- I think all of you\nare procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, (Laughter) and some of you may have\na healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week\nof a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already\nused a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long,\nhard look at that calendar. We need to think about what\nwe're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating\non something in life. We need to stay aware\nof the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not\nthat many boxes on there, it's a job that should\nprobably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... (Laughter) You know. Sometime soon. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher,\nI made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back,\nI calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ\nwas not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers\ndid not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids\nweren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need\nto learn in seventh grade math, sure, they're hard: ratios, decimals,\nthe area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible, and I was firmly convinced\nthat every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion\nthat what we need in education is a much better understanding\nof students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing\nwe know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing\nwell in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn\nquickly and easily? So I left the classroom, and I went to graduate school\nto become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super\nchallenging settings, and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went\nto West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training\nand which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children\nwould advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers\nworking in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers are still\ngoing to be here in teaching by the end of the school year, and of those, who will be\nthe most effective at improving learning\noutcomes for their students? We partnered with private\ncompanies, asking, which of these salespeople\nis going to keep their jobs? And who's going to earn the most money? In all those very different contexts, one characteristic emerged\nas a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks, physical health, and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance\nfor very long-term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future,\nday in, day out, not just for the week,\nnot just for the month, but for years, and working really hard\nto make that future a reality. Grit is living life\nlike it's a marathon, not a sprint. A few years ago, I started studying grit\nin the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires, and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more\nlikely to graduate, even when I matched them\non every characteristic I could measure, things like family income, standardized achievement test scores, even how safe kids felt\nwhen they were at school. So it's not just at West Point\nor the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school, especially for kids\nat risk for dropping out. To me, the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know, how little science knows,\nabout building it. Every day, parents and teachers ask me, \"How do I build grit in kids? What do I do to teach kids\na solid work ethic? How do I keep them motivated\nfor the long run?\" The honest answer is, I don't know. (Laughter) What I do know is that talent\ndoesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through\non their commitments. In fact, in our data,\ngrit is usually unrelated or even inversely related\nto measures of talent. So far, the best idea I've heard\nabout building grit in kids is something called \"growth mindset.\" This is an idea developed\nat Stanford University by Carol Dweck, and it is the belief that the ability\nto learn is not fixed, that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read\nand learn about the brain and how it changes and grows\nin response to challenge, they're much more likely\nto persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure\nis a permanent condition. So growth mindset\nis a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going\nto end my remarks, because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas,\nour strongest intuitions, and we need to test them. We need to measure\nwhether we've been successful, and we have to be willing\nto fail, to be wrong, to start over again with lessons learned. In other words, we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you.

{"page": 85, "lesson": 22, "title": "Why the only future worth building includes everyone - Pope Francis", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-the-only-future-worth-building-includes-everyone-pope-francis", "transcript": {"en": "Translator: Elena Montrasio\nReviewer: TED Translators admin [His Holiness Pope Francis\nFilmed in Vatican City First shown at TED2017] Good evening – or, good morning,\nI am not sure what time it is there. Regardless of the hour, I am thrilled\nto be participating in your conference. I very much like its title\n– \"The Future You\" – because, while looking at tomorrow,\nit invites us to open a dialogue today, to look at the future through a \"you.\" \"The Future You:\" the future is made of yous,\nit is made of encounters, because life flows\nthrough our relations with others. Quite a few years of life have strengthened my conviction that each and everyone's existence\nis deeply tied to that of others: life is not time merely passing by,\nlife is about interactions. As I meet, or lend an ear\nto those who are sick, to the migrants\nwho face terrible hardships in search of a brighter future, to prison inmates who carry\na hell of pain inside their hearts, and to those, many of them young,\nwho cannot find a job, I often find myself wondering: \"Why them and not me?\" I, myself, was born\nin a family of migrants; my father, my grandparents,\nlike many other Italians, left for Argentina and met the fate of those\nwho are left with nothing. I could have very well ended up\namong today's \"discarded\" people. And that's why I always ask myself,\ndeep in my heart: \"Why them and not me?\" First and foremost, I would love it\nif this meeting could help to remind us that we all need each other, none of us is an island, an autonomous and independent \"I,\"\nseparated from the other, and we can only build the future\nby standing together, including everyone. We don’t think about it often,\nbut everything is connected, and we need to restore\nour connections to a healthy state. Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart against my brother or my sister, the open wound that was never cured,\nthe offense that was never forgiven, the rancor that is only going to hurt me, are all instances of a fight\nthat I carry within me, a flare deep in my heart\nthat needs to be extinguished before it goes up in flames,\nleaving only ashes behind. Many of us, nowadays, seem to believe that a happy future\nis something impossible to achieve. While such concerns\nmust be taken very seriously, they are not invincible. They can be overcome when we don't lock\nour door to the outside world. Happiness can only be discovered as a gift of harmony between the whole\nand each single component. Even science – and you know it\nbetter than I do – points to an understanding of reality as a place where every element connects\nand interacts with everything else. And this brings me to my second message. How wonderful would it be if the growth of scientific\nand technological innovation would come along with more equality\nand social inclusion. How wonderful would it be,\nwhile we discover faraway planets, to rediscover the needs of the brothers\nand sisters orbiting around us. How wonderful would it be if solidarity, this beautiful and, at times,\ninconvenient word, were not simply reduced to social work, and became, instead, the default attitude in political, economic\nand scientific choices, as well as in the relationships\namong individuals, peoples and countries. Only by educating people\nto a true solidarity will we be able to overcome the \"culture of waste,\" which doesn't concern only food and goods but, first and foremost, the people who are cast aside\nby our techno-economic systems which, without even realizing it, are now putting products\nat their core, instead of people. Solidarity is a term that many wish\nto erase from the dictionary. Solidarity, however,\nis not an automatic mechanism. It cannot be programmed or controlled. It is a free response born\nfrom the heart of each and everyone. Yes, a free response! When one realizes that life, even in the middle\nof so many contradictions, is a gift, that love is the source\nand the meaning of life, how can they withhold their urge\nto do good to another fellow being? In order to do good, we need memory, we need courage\nand we need creativity. And I know that TED\ngathers many creative minds. Yes, love does require\na creative, concrete and ingenious attitude. Good intentions and conventional formulas, so often used to appease\nour conscience, are not enough. Let us help each other,\nall together, to remember that the other is not\na statistic or a number. The other has a face. The \"you\" is always a real presence, a person to take care of. There is a parable Jesus told\nto help us understand the difference between those who'd rather not be bothered\nand those who take care of the other. I am sure you have heard it before.\nIt is the Parable of the Good Samaritan. When Jesus was asked:\n\"Who is my neighbor?\" - namely, \"Who should I take care of?\" - he told this story, the story of a man who had been assaulted, robbed,\nbeaten and abandoned along a dirt road. Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,\ntwo very influential people of the time, walked past him without stopping to help. After a while, a Samaritan, a very much\ndespised ethnicity at the time, walked by. Seeing the injured man\nlying on the ground, he did not ignore him\nas if he weren't even there. Instead, he felt compassion for this man, which compelled him to act\nin a very concrete manner. He poured oil and wine\non the wounds of the helpless man, brought him to a hostel and paid out of his pocket\nfor him to be assisted. The story of the Good Samaritan\nis the story of today’s humanity. People's paths are riddled with suffering, as everything is centered around money,\nand things, instead of people. And often there is this habit, by people\nwho call themselves \"respectable,\" of not taking care of the others, thus leaving behind thousands\nof human beings, or entire populations, on the side of the road. Fortunately, there are also those\nwho are creating a new world by taking care of the other,\neven out of their own pockets. Mother Teresa actually said: \"One cannot love,\nunless it is at their own expense.\" We have so much to do,\nand we must do it together. But how can we do that\nwith all the evil we breathe every day? Thank God, no system can nullify our desire\nto open up to the good, to compassion and to our capacity\nto react against evil, all of which stem\nfrom deep within our hearts. Now you might tell me, \"Sure, these are beautiful words, but I am not the Good Samaritan,\nnor Mother Teresa of Calcutta.\" On the contrary: we are precious,\neach and every one of us. Each and every one of us\nis irreplaceable in the eyes of God. Through the darkness of today's conflicts, each and every one of us\ncan become a bright candle, a reminder that light\nwill overcome darkness, and never the other way around. To Christians,\nthe future does have a name, and its name is Hope. Feeling hopeful does not mean\nto be optimistically naïve and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing. Hope is the virtue of a heart that doesn't lock itself into darkness,\nthat doesn't dwell on the past, does not simply get by in the present,\nbut is able to see a tomorrow. Hope is the door\nthat opens onto the future. Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life that, with time,\nwill develop into a large tree. It is like some invisible yeast\nthat allows the whole dough to grow, that brings flavor to all aspects of life. And it can do so much, because a tiny flicker of light\nthat feeds on hope is enough to shatter\nthe shield of darkness. A single individual\nis enough for hope to exist, and that individual can be you. And then there will be another \"you,\"\nand another \"you,\" and it turns into an \"us.\" And so, does hope begin\nwhen we have an \"us?\" No. Hope began with one \"you.\" When there is an \"us,\"\nthere begins a revolution. The third message\nI would like to share today is, indeed, about revolution:\nthe revolution of tenderness. And what is tenderness? It is the love that comes close\nand becomes real. It is a movement\nthat starts from our heart and reaches the eyes,\nthe ears and the hands. Tenderness means to use\nour eyes to see the other, our ears to hear the other, to listen to the children, the poor,\nthose who are afraid of the future. To listen also to the silent cry\nof our common home, of our sick and polluted earth. Tenderness means to use\nour hands and our heart to comfort the other, to take care of those in need. Tenderness is the language\nof the young children, of those who need the other. A child’s love for mom and dad grows through their touch, their gaze,\ntheir voice, their tenderness. I like when I hear parents talk to their babies,\nadapting to the little child, sharing the same level of communication. This is tenderness:\nbeing on the same level as the other. God himself descended into Jesus\nto be on our level. This is the same path\nthe Good Samaritan took. This is the path that Jesus himself took. He lowered himself, he lived his entire human existence practicing the real,\nconcrete language of love. Yes, tenderness is the path of choice for the strongest,\nmost courageous men and women. Tenderness is not weakness;\nit is fortitude. It is the path of solidarity,\nthe path of humility. Please, allow me to say it loud and clear: the more powerful you are, the more your actions\nwill have an impact on people, the more responsible you are\nto act humbly. If you don’t, your power will ruin you,\nand you will ruin the other. There is a saying in Argentina: \"Power is like drinking gin\non an empty stomach.\" You feel dizzy, you get drunk,\nyou lose your balance, and you will end up hurting yourself\nand those around you, if you don’t connect your power\nwith humility and tenderness. Through humility and concrete love,\non the other hand, power – the highest, the strongest one –\nbecomes a service, a force for good. The future of humankind isn't exclusively\nin the hands of politicians, of great leaders, of big companies. Yes, they do hold\nan enormous responsibility. But the future is, most of all,\nin the hands of those people who recognize the other as a \"you\" and themselves as part of an \"us.\" We all need each other. And so, please, think of me\nas well with tenderness, so that I can fulfill the task\nI have been given for the good of the other, of each and every one, of all of you, of all of us. Thank you."}, "multiple-choice": []}

first time that you tasted two-hundred-year-old snow well I do I licked it right off the wall of a cave made of ice sitting underneath a glacier just north of Juneau Alaska and I've got to tell you this was the purest crispest coldest h2o I have ever tasted of course it wasn't snow anymore by the time that I tasted it it was this gorgeous blue glacial ice really if you ever have the chance to lick a glacier you really got to do it glacier ice is this color blue that almost defies description because it only occurs in these places and you can really only compare it to itself so around 200 years ago much higher up that Mountain Valley this ice fell as snow and the atmosphere through which those snowflakes fell was very different from our own contained a full one-third less carbon dioxide than our atmosphere does now those snowflakes were buried my flurry after flurry until eventually every last bubble of air was squeezed out from between those delicate little crystals and it formed a solid mass it somehow that solid mass was still able to flow and was buried and then carried along this journey by gravity and time in a frozen time capsule called Mendenhall Glacier until one day that ice that mountain of old snow it it crossed this little bump in the terrain and it created a void a cave and that's where it met me and if I had known the incredible journey that this at this h2o had been on I might not have drank it and turned it into pee but here we are I was only able to see this because I was there at the right place in the right moment in time and I'm sharing it with you today because it no longer exists you know the same slow creep of gravity and time that that brought all of that ice from the mountain down to my mouth it doesn't sure that any ice cave has a short lifespan but as they disappear these ice caves are usually replaced by others as the mass of that glacier sort of flows in behind it it's this really beautiful cycle of death and rebirth of these temporary places at least that's how the story has gone for thousands of years that story is now different because this glacier is dying it is melting faster than time and snow can replace it I want you to look at this color blue how does it make you feel I'm showing it to you I'm asking you to look at this color of this ice from this cave that no longer exists to burn one idea into your mind the wonders that we never see we will never miss now when I visited this cave I didn't know that I'd be giving its eulogy one day I went there to make a video for my youtube channel my channel is called it's okay to be smart and I make educational videos that are viewed by millions of people around the world who join me on these little curiosity journeys as I tell really bad dad jokes and I'm a dad now so I'm allowed to stuff like you should never fight an octopus they're well-armed I'm not sorry it's okay to be smart is also a motto that reminds people that discovering the answers to things it feels good it's a feeling that the physicist Richard Fineman once called the pleasure of finding things out unless you're finding out that beautiful glacial ice caves are dying I guess that doesn't feel so good that's not what the video was about the video is about physics it was about why glacial ice is this beautiful color blue and the answer is really really cool and you need to know it because there are wrong answers all over the internet and next to climate change I don't think there's anything that makes me more sad than that now it's not because of the same reason that the sky is blue it's not because of light bouncing off of little particles it's not reflecting the color of the sky or anything like that no it's way way cooler than that so inside of that glacier are a bunch of water molecules thousands at least and they're in there and even though it's a solid mass they're vibrating molecules just vibrate it's what they do they're like amped up Ted speakers or chihuahuas or something so water is this v-shaped molecule you got an oxygen right here and then you've got two hydrogen's up here okay now some of those water molecules are in there and they're vibrating like this and some are vibrating like this this is the glacier vibrating water dance and you guys can do it your next party okay so light vibrates to because it acts like a wave so if light comes along at the right color at the right frequency or wavelength turns out it can be vibrating in sync with that water molecule and that water molecule sucks it right up that color of light is subtracted out okay so it turns out that one of waters favorite wavelengths to suck up when it's doing its little vibration dance is around 700 nanometers that is reddish orange light if you take the white light of the Sun all the colors subtract out a red orange you're left with that beautiful blue color every designer in the audience is like that's more of a cyan but you know whatever you can only see this when you're deep inside of a glacier as the lightest pass through several meters of all these vibrating water molecules and this is the same reason that the ocean is blue now who loves this color just a little bit more now yeah that's what I thought the creating that feeling people is what motivates me to educate the world through YouTube videos because sharing stories like this how many people know this understand this it feels good it brings us joy right but it can also bring us sadness when we learn that the thing that we just learned to love is never going to exist on that spot ever again ever again in our lifetime that doesn't feel very good but I do it so that we see it and we know it and that we learn to love it because maybe then we'll fight just a little bit harder to save it so thanks to human activities from climate change environmental pollution to habitat loss more of the natural world living and nonliving alike is under threat today than at any point in our human existence the entire time our species has been around we're talking more birds more ice more forests more islands insects mammals just about everything but for every Rhino or orangutan or coral reef or ancient tree or whatever famous an endangered thing that we've all heard of there are tens maybe hundreds that we never hear about those weird deep-sea fish these forest sized webs of fungus these ice caves or the Indian purple frog whatever that's supposed to be they're disappearing but invisible and unknown but it doesn't have to be this way so most of you raise your hands that you feel like you love this color blue a little bit more how did I make you feel that way why did I make you feel that way well I was in the right place at the right time I guess but to be honest I saw 12 other people in that cave that day and I don't see any of them up here today helping you build a deep emotional bond with a color so and I'm not I'm not lucky I wasn't elected in a lottery to be the dyeing glacier ambassador and I am just one person we don't live in a Disney film and no matter how much I love that glacier I'm not enough to save it on my own maybe if I was Elsa though what made the difference is that I shared its story and not just its story but the sense of wonder that it brought me I believe this if every one of Earth's nearly eight billion people truly knew the scale the stories that we stand to lose we wouldn't never let it happen and luckily all of you have the tools to help them see you all have a voice you're all probably carrying a camera in your pocket you have a sense of curiosity it drive to know more and the most important thing you have that we all have is that little voice in the back of your mind that when you see something really amazing says man isn't that wonderful in our species is everywhere on this planet which is part of the problem but just imagine how many places how many creatures how many stories one person is in the right place at the right moment to see and today what one person sees we can all see what one person loves we can all learn to love that is why I make youtube videos because when we all see we all know and we all learn to love what we stand to lose then we will fight harder to save it there's one book that I returned through every year to reread it's called a sand County Almanac by Aldo Leopold he was a conservationist way back in the 20th century whose work in conservation helped us develop a completely new philosophy of how humans in the wild world interact this book is a collection of stories about nature as he saw it and he has this ability to make the most mundane things looked like they were painted into the landscape by like Michelangelo himself I mean he could turn a single shrub and to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel it's truly amazing there's one passage that stands out he's camping near the banks of a wild river in Wisconsin and there are no wild rivers in Wisconsin anymore up around the bend come two young men in a canoe they pull up to the shore and they get to talking and he learns these two young men are about to ship out for the army their city boys this is their first and likely their very last trip to the wilderness they have fallen in love with this place it's given them something to remember something that they'll miss wherever it is that they're going and as he tells their story he also tells the story of this place of the river the fish the trees the forest and how it's being dammed up and cut down in the name of progress nearly a hundred years ago and as those two young men set their canoe on down the river he ends the story with this thought perhaps our grandsons having never seen a wild river we'll never miss the chance to set a canoe in singing waters the wonders that we never see we will never miss because he was there at that moment he helped me see and I really wish I could have saved that place what if we all turned our tools towards nature just a little bit more often what could we save so if you see a wild river or an ice cave or I don't know that tree that you walk by every single day or a weird purple frog then learn its story why it is the way that it is and then share it with the rest of us so that we don't miss our chance to see it thank you you"}, "multiple-choice": []}
