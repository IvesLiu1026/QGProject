I'm Logan Smalley, I'm Bedirhan Cinar, I'm Jordan Reeves, and I'm Stephanie Lo. We represent the TED-Ed team. We're going to tell you about\nhow the website is organized, about the lessons\nthat surround each video, how you can customize or flip\nyour own lesson, and how you can measure\nthe lesson's effect on your class or the world. Towards the end of the tour, we'll reveal one more major feature that directly affects\nevery person viewing this video. Let's get started with the home page. On the home page,\nyou'll find original TED-Ed videos, each is a lesson recorded\nby an actual educator that's visualized\nby a professional animator. You can nominate educators and animators in the \"Get Involved\" section of the site. The TED-Ed library can be browsed\nthrough two different lenses. Learners can use the \"Series\" view\nto browse videos thematically and based on their own curiosity. And teachers can use\nthe browse by \"Subject\" view to find the perfect short video\nto show in class or to assign as homework. Every video on TED-Ed\nis accompanied by a lesson. These lessons don't replace good teaching, but they can be supplementary resources for students and teachers\naround the world. Let's look at this one, created by a teacher in the US\nand an animator in the UK. When you arrive on the lesson page,\nsimply click play; the video will continue to play as you navigate the lesson's sections\nthat surround it. In the \"Quick Quiz\" section, you'll find multiple-choice questions that check for basic\ncomprehension of the video. You get real-time feedback on your answers and if you get one wrong,\nyou can use the video hint. You'll find open-answer questions\nin the \"Think\" section. And in the \"Dig Deeper\" section, you'll find additional resources\nfor exploring the topic. You can complete the lessons anonymously, but if you log in, you can track\nyour own learning across the site. Just visit the \"Recent Activity\" feed, and you'll find answers you've saved to lessons that you've already\nstarted or completed. And now to one of the most powerful\nfeatures of the TED-Ed website: flipping a lesson. Flipping a featured lesson allows you\nto edit each of the lesson's sections. You can edit the title\nas it relates to your class. You can use the \"Let's Begin\" section to provide instructions\nor context for the lesson. You can select or deselect\nany \"Quick Quiz\" question. In the \"Think\" section, you can add your own\nopen-answer questions. And in the \"Dig Deeper\" section, you can use the resources provided\nor add your own. When you finish flipping a lesson, it'll publish to a new and unique URL. And because the link is unique, it can measure the progress\nof any learner you share it with. You can use it to measure participation and accuracy of any individual\nstudent's answers. So that's how you flip\na featured TED-Ed video, We've got one more major feature\nto tell you about. Using the TED-Ed platform, you can flip any video from YouTube. That means you can create a lesson\naround any TED Talk, any TEDx Talk, but also any of the other thousands\nof great educational videos on YouTube, including the ones that you yourself\ncould record, upload and flip. And through flipping these lessons, together we'll create\na free and remarkable library of lessons worth sharing."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do you find on the homepage of the TED-Ed website?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Photographs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Original TED-Ed videos"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Questions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What does flipping a lesson mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Watching a video"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Skipping in place"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Customizing a lesson found on the TED-Ed website"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Snapping your fingers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What type of videos can you flip into a lesson using the TED-Ed website?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "TED-Ed Originals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "TEDTalks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "YouTube videos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How do you nominate an Educator or Animator?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Go to the tour page"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Go to the get involved page"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Go to the about page"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Send the TED-Ed team an email"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How can you browse videos on the TED-Ed website?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By series"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By subject"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By title"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None ofthe above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
