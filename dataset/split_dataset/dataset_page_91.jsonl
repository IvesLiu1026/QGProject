It's a process you rarely think about, but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated\neffort is playing out. Your vital organs, the gut, brain, bones, lungs, blood, and heart work together to sustain your life by delivering oxygen\nto tissues throughout your body. Most of our cells need oxygen because it's one of the key ingredients\nof aerobic respiration. That's the process that produces\na molecule called ATP, which our cells use to power their\nmany incredible functions. But getting oxygen throughout our\nbodies is a surprisingly difficult task. Gas enters cells by diffusing in\nfrom their surroundings. And that only happens efficiently\nover tiny distances. So for oxygen to reach the cells\nwithin our bodies, it needs a transportation network. This is where our 20 trillion \nred blood cells come in. Each one contains about 270 million\noxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin, which is what gives blood its scarlet hue. To make these cells, the body uses\nraw materials that become available from\nthe food we eat. So in some ways, you could say\nthat oxygen's journey through the body really begins in the gut. Here, in an amazing display of mechanical\nand chemical digestion, food gets broken down into\nits smallest elements, like iron, the building block\nof hemoglobin. Iron is carried through \nthe cardiovascular system to the body's hematopoietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace \nof red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within\nour bone marrow cavities. The kidneys regulate \nour levels of red blood cells through the release of erythropoietin, a hormone which causes marrow\nto increase production. Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million\nred blood cells per second, a number equivalent to the entire\npopulation of Paris, so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs\nwill have ample transportation. But before oxygen \ncan even reach the lungs, the brain needs to get involved. The brainstem initiates breathing by sending a message\nthrough your nervous system, all the way to muscles \nof the diaphragm and ribs. This causes them to contract, thus increasing the space\ninside the rib cage, which allows the lungs to expand. That expansion drops your lungs\ninternal air pressure, making air rush in. It's tempting to think of our lungs\nas two big balloons, but they're actually a lot more \ncomplicated than that. Here's why. The red blood cells in the vessels\nwithin your lungs can only pick up oxygen molecules\nthat are very close to them. If our lungs were shaped like balloons, air that was not in direct contact\nwith the balloon's inner surface couldn't diffuse through. Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures\nthat very little oxygen is wasted. Their interior is divided into\nhundreds of millions of miniature balloon-like projections\ncalled alveoli that dramatically increase \nthe contact area to somewhere around 100 square meters. The alveolar walls are made of\nextremely thin flat cells that are surrounded by capillaries. Together, the alveolar wall and\ncapillaries make a two-cell thick membrane that brings blood and oxygen close enough\nfor diffusion. These oxygen-enriched cells are then\ncarried from the lungs through the cardiovascular network, a massive collection of blood vessels\nthat reaches every cell in the body. If we laid this system out\nend to end in a straight line, the vessels would wrap around the Earth\nseveral times. Propelling red blood cells\nthrough this extensive network requires a pretty powerful pump, and that's where your heart comes in. The human heart pumps an average\nof about 100,000 times per day, and it's the powerhouse that ultimately\ngets oxygen where it needs to go, completing the body's team effort. Just think - this entire complex system\nis built around the delivery of tiny molecules of oxygen. If just one part malfunctioned,\nso would we. Breathe in. Your gut, brain, bones, \nlungs, blood, and heart are continuing their incredible act\nof coordination that keeps you alive.

This is the sort of question advertisers\nhave always asked, and there are no easy answers. However, there is a handy tool\nthat helps companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called the focus group. Until the 1940s, market research\nwas often quantitative using things like sales figures\nand customer polls to track consumption. But this changed during World War II. Sociologists Robert Merton\nand Paul Lazarsfeld set out to learn how unprecedented\nexposure to wartime propaganda was affecting the public. Instead of polling large numbers of people with straightforward questions\nand quantifiable answers, the researchers conducted \nin-person interviews, sometimes with small groups, engaging them in more open discussions. Later, this method was picked up\nby the advertising industry with the help of consultants, like Austrian-born psychologist\nErnest Dichter, who first coined the term focus group. This new technique was a type\nof qualitative research focused on the nature \nof people's preferences and thoughts. It couldn't tell marketers what percentage\nof people buy a certain product or brand, but it could tell them more about\nthe people who do, their reasoning for doing so, and even the unconscious motivations\nbehind those reasons. Rather than providing definite conclusions\nfor business and sales, focus groups would be used\nfor exploratory research, generating new ideas for products and marketing based on deeper\nunderstanding of consumer habits. For example, early focus groups found that\ncontrary to popular opinion at the time, wives often had more influence than their\nhusbands when choosing which car to buy, so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing\ncars directly to women. And Dr. Dichter himself conducted\nfocus groups for Mattel to learn what girls wanted in a doll. The result was the original Barbie doll. So how does a focus group work? First, companies recruit between\nsix and ten participants according to specific criteria\nthat meet their research objectives. They could be mothers of children\nbetween five and seven, or teenagers planning to buy\na new phone in the next three months. This is often done through professional\nrecruiters who manage lists of people who've agreed to participate in\nfocus groups for payment or other rewards. During a session, participants are asked\nto respond to various prompts from the group moderator, like sharing their opinions\non a certain product, or their emotional reactions\nto an advertisement. They may even be asked to do\nseemingly unrelated tasks, like imagining brands as animals in a zoo. The idea is that this can reveal \nuseful information about the participant's feelings that traditional questions \nmight not get to. Beyond these basics,\nmany variations are possible. A focus group may have two\nor more moderators perhaps taking opposite sides\non a question, or a researcher might be hidden\nin the focus group unknown to other participants to see\nhow their answers can be influenced. And the whole process may also\nbe observed by researchers through a one-way mirror. But although they can provide\nvaluable insight, focus groups do have their limitations, and one of the main ones is that\nthe simple act of observing something can change it. This principle is called \nobserver interference. The answers participants give are likely to be affected \nby the presence of the researchers, social pressure \nfrom the rest of the group, or simply knowing that they're taking\npart in a focus group. And because researchers often use\na small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results. The findings that researchers do reach\nfrom focus groups are often tested through experiments\nand data gathering. Those put numbers on questions like\nhow many potential customers there are and what price they'd be willing to pay. This part of the process changes\nas technology evolves. But focus groups have remained\nlargely the same for decades. Perhaps when it comes\nto the big, important questions, there's no substitute for people\ngenuinely interacting with each other."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Focus groups are a technique of _____________ research.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Quantitative"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Qualitative"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Statistical"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Optical"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Focus groups are used:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "As part of exploratory research"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To get definitive conclusions about certain topics"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To read people’s minds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To estimate the percentage of people who buy a certain product or brand"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many participants are generally recruited for a standard focus group?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ten to twenty"}, {"label": "B", "text": "One to three"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Six to ten"}, {"label": "D", "text": "More than twenty"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who usually guides the discussion in a focus group?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A computer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A script"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A group moderator"}, {"label": "D", "text": "One of the participants"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Researchers observing the focus group commonly do this by a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hole in the wall"}, {"label": "B", "text": "One-way mirror"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Dark chamber"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Proprietary software"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Maybe you know a similar feeling. You sit down to take a math test, and you feel your heart beat faster and your palms start to sweat. You get butterflies in your stomach,\nand you can't concentrate. This phenomenon is called math anxiety, and if it happens to you,\nyou're not alone. Researchers think about 20% \nof the population suffers from it. Some psychologists even consider it\na diagnosable condition. But having mathematical anxiety doesn't\nnecessarily mean you're bad at math - not even close. Laurent Schwartz went on to win\nthe Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. People might think that they're anxious\nabout math because they're bad at it, but it's often the other way around. They're doing poorly in math\nbecause they're anxious about it. Some psychologists think that's because math anxiety decreases \na cognitive resource called working memory. That's the short-term memory system that helps you organize the information \nyou need to complete a task. Worrying about being able to solve\nmath problems, or not doing well on a test, eats up working memory, leaving less of it available to tackle\nthe math itself. People can suddenly struggle\nwith even basic math skills, like arithmetic, \nthat they've otherwise mastered. Academic anxiety certainly\nisn't limited to math, but it does seem to happen much\nmore frequently, and cause more harm\nin that subject. So why would that be? Researchers aren't yet sure, but some studies suggest that the way children are exposed\nto math by their parents and teachers play a large part. If parents talk about math like\nsomething challenging and unfamiliar, children can internalize that. Teachers with math anxiety are also\nlikely to spread it to their students. Pressure to solve problems quickly\ndials up stress even more. And in some cultures, being good\nat math is a sign of being smart in general. When the stakes are that high, it's not surprising \nthat students are anxious. Even Maryam Mirzakhani, \nan influential mathematician who was the first woman to win\nthe Fields Medal, felt unconfident and lost interest\nin mathematics because her math teacher in middle school\ndidn't think she was talented. So if you experience mathematical anxiety, what can you do? Relaxation techniques, \nlike short breathing exercises, have improved test performance\nin students with math anxiety. Writing down your worries can also help. This strategy may give you a chance\nto reevaluate a stressful experience, freeing up working memory. And if you have the chance, physical activity, like a brisk walk,\ndeepens breathing and helps relieve muscle tension, preventing anxiety from building. You can also use your knowledge\nabout the brain to change your mindset. The brain is flexible, and the areas involved in math skills \ncan always grow and develop. This is a psychological principle\ncalled the growth mindset. Thinking of yourself as someone\nwho can grow and improve can actually help you grow and improve. If you're a teacher \nor parent of young children, try being playful with math\nand focusing on the creative aspects. That can build the numerical skills that help students approach math \nwith confidence later on. Importantly, you should give children\nthe time and space to work through their answers. And if you're an administrator, make sure your teachers \nhave the positive attitudes and mathematical confidence necessary to inspire confidence \nin all of their students. Also, don't let anyone spread the myth that boys are innately \nbetter than girls at math. That is completely false. If you experience math anxiety, it may not help to just know \nthat math anxiety exists. Or perhaps it's reassuring to put\na name to the problem. Regardless, if you take a look\naround yourself, the odds are good that you'll see someone \nexperiencing the same thing as you.

Ali captivated Harvard's \ngraduating class in 1975 with his message of unity and friendship. When he finished, \nthe audience wanted more. They wanted a poem. Ali delivered what is considered\nthe shortest poem ever. \"Me, we.\" Or is it \"me, weeee\"? No one's really sure. Regardless, if these two words are a poem,\nthen what exactly makes a poem a poem? Poets themselves have struggled\nwith this question, often using metaphors to approximate\na definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? Poetry generally has certain\nrecognizable characteristics. One - poems emphasize language's\nmusical qualities. This can be achieved through\nrhyme, rhythm, and meter, from the sonnets of Shakepeare, to the odes of Confucius, to the Sanskrit Vedas. Two - poems use condensed language, like literature with all the water\nwrung out of it. Three - poems often feature\nintense feelings, from Rumi's spiritual poetry to Pablo Neruda's \"Ode to an Onion.\" Poetry, like art itself, has a way\nof challenging simple definitions. While the rhythmic patterns \nof the earliest poems were a way to remember stories\neven before the advent of writing, a poem doesn't need to be lyrical. Reinhard Döhl's “Apfel” and Eugen Gomringer's \"silencio\" toe the line between visual art\nand poetry. Meanwhile, E.E. Cummings wrote poems\nwhose shapes were as important as the words themselves, in this case amplifying the sad loneliness\nof a single leaf falling through space. If the visual nature of poetry\nfaded into the background, perhaps we'd be left with music, and that's an area that people\nlove to debate. Are songs poems? Many don't regard songwriters as poets\nin a literary sense, but lyrics from artists like Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, and Tupac Shakur often hold up even without the music. In rap, poet elements like rhyme,\nrhythm, and imagery are inseparable from the form. Take this lyric from the Notorious B.I.G. \"I can hear sweat trickling \ndown your cheek Your heartbeat sound \nlike Sasquatch feet Thundering, shaking the concrete.\" So far, all the examples we've seen\nhave had line breaks. We can even imagine the two words\nof Ali's poem organizing in the air - Me, We. Poetry has a shape \nthat we can usually recognize. Its line breaks help readers navigate\nthe rhythms of a poem. But what if those line breaks disappeared? Would it lose its essence as a poem? Maybe not. Enter the prose poem. Prose poems use vivid images\nand wordplay but are formatted like paragraphs. When we look at poetry less as a form\nand more as a concept, we can see the poetic all around us: spiritual hymns, the speeches of orators like\nMartin Luther King, Jr., JFK, and Winston Churchill, and surprising places like social media. In 2010, journalist Joanna Smith tweeted\nupdates from the earthquake in Haiti. \"Was in b-room getting dressed\nwhen heard my name. Tremor. Ran outside through sliding door. All still now. Safe. Roosters crowing.\" Smith uses language in a way\nthat is powerful, direct, and filled with vivid images. Compare her language to a haiku, the ancient Japanese poetic form \nthat emphasizes bursts of brief intensity with just three lines of five, \nseven, and five syllables. The waters of poetry run wide and deep. Poetry has evolved over time, and perhaps now more than ever, the line between poetry, \nprose, song, and visual art has blurred. However, one thing has not changed. The word poetry actually began\nin verb form, coming from the ancient Greek poiesis,\nwhich means to create. Poets, like craftsman, still work with\nthe raw materials of the world to forge new understandings and comment on what it is to be human\nin a way only humans can. Dartmouth researchers tested this idea\nby asking robots to pen poetry. A panel of judges sorted \nthrough stacks of sonnets to see if they could distinguish those\nmade by man and machine. You may be happy to know that while\nscientists have successfully used artificial intelligence \nin manufacturing, medicine, and even journalism, poetry is a different story. The robots were caught red-handed\n100% of the time."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following is not a characteristic traditionally associated with poetry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rhythm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Condensed language"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Intense feelings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Paragraphs"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following was not an example from the lesson that challenged a traditional concept of poetry?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Visual art"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Debates"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Speeches"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Songs"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In what way was Joanna Smith’s tweet like a poem?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Smith used condensed language to create a powerful image"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Smith used rhyming patterns common in many poems"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Smith used line breaks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Smith published her work in a collection of poems"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The word poetry comes from the Greek “poiesis.” What does this word mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To rhyme"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To write"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To make"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To think"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is a haiku?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A type of poem that consists of three lines of 5, 7, and 5 syllables"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A type of poem that consists of three lines of 7, 5, and 5 syllables"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A type of poem that rhymes and is often sung"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A type of poem that creates a shape or picture that adds to its meaning"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What does Reinhard Dohl’s “Apfel” have in common with e.e. cummings’ “l(a)”?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The musical quality of language is emphasized in both poems"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The visual arrangement of words is important to the meaning of each poem"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both are written in English"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both are considered free verse poetry"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Until then, chocolate only existed\nin Mesoamerica in a form quite different \nfrom what we know. As far back as 1900 BCE, the people of that region had learned\nto prepare the beans of the native cacao tree. The earliest records tell us the beans\nwere ground and mixed with cornmeal\nand chili peppers to create a drink - not a relaxing cup of hot cocoa, but a bitter, invigorating concoction\nfrothing with foam. And if you thought we make\na big deal about chocolate today, the Mesoamericans had us beat. They believed that cacao\nwas a heavenly food gifted to humans\nby a feathered serpent god, known to the Maya as Kukulkan and to the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. Aztecs used cacao beans as currency and drank chocolate at royal feasts, gave it to soldiers as a reward\nfor success in battle, and used it in rituals. The first transatlantic\nchocolate encounter occurred in 1519 when Hernán Cortés visited\nthe court of Moctezuma at Tenochtitlan. As recorded by Cortés's lieutenant, the king had 50 jugs of the drink\nbrought out and poured into golden cups. When the colonists returned with shipments\nof the strange new bean, missionaries' salacious accounts\nof native customs gave it a reputation as an aphrodisiac. At first, its bitter taste made it\nsuitable as a medicine for ailments, like upset stomachs, but sweetening it with honey,\nsugar, or vanilla quickly made chocolate a popular delicacy\nin the Spanish court. And soon, no aristocratic home was\ncomplete without dedicated chocolate ware. The fashionable drink was difficult\nand time consuming to produce on a large scale. That involved using plantations\nand imported slave labor in the Caribbean and \non islands off the coast of Africa. The world of chocolate would change\nforever in 1828 with the introduction of the cocoa press\nby Coenraad van Houten of Amsterdam. Van Houten's invention could separate\nthe cocoa's natural fat, or cocoa butter. This left a powder that could be mixed\ninto a drinkable solution or recombined with the cocoa butter to create the solid chocolate\nwe know today. Not long after, a Swiss chocolatier\nnamed Daniel Peter added powdered milk to the mix, thus inventing milk chocolate. By the 20th century, chocolate\nwas no longer an elite luxury but had become a treat for the public. Meeting the massive demand required\nmore cultivation of cocoa, which can only grow near the equator. Now, instead of African slaves \nbeing shipped to South American cocoa plantations, cocoa production itself would shift\nto West Africa with Cote d'Ivoire providing two-fifths\nof the world's cocoa as of 2015. Yet along with the growth\nof the industry, there have been horrific abuses\nof human rights. Many of the plantations throughout\nWest Africa, which supply Western companies, use slave and child labor, with an estimation of more than\n2 million children affected. This is a complex problem\nthat persists despite efforts from major chocolate\ncompanies to partner with African nations to reduce child \nand indentured labor practices. Today, chocolate has established itself\nin the rituals of our modern culture.

And how did it happen? - Ellen Schrecker", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-mccarthyism-and-how-did-it-happen-ellen-schrecker", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine that one day,\nyou're summoned before a government panel. Even though you haven't \ncommitted any crime, or been formally charged with one, you are repeatedly questioned\nabout your political views, accused of disloyalty, and asked to incriminate your friends\nand associates. If you don't cooperate,\nyou risk jail or losing your job. This is exactly what happened in\nthe United States in the 1950s as part of a campaign to expose\nsuspected communists. Named after its most \nnotorious practitioner, the phenomenon known as McCarthyism\ndestroyed thousands of lives and careers. For over a decade, American political \nleaders trampled democratic freedoms in the name of protecting them. During the 1930s and 1940s, there had been an active but small\ncommunist party in the United States. Its record was mixed. While it played crucial roles in wider \nprogressive struggles for labor and civil rights, it also supported the Soviet Union. From the start, the American \nCommunist Party faced attacks from conservatives and business leaders, as well as from liberals who criticized\nits ties to the oppressive Soviet regime. During World War II, when the USA\nand USSR were allied against Hitler, some American communists actually\nspied for the Russians. When the Cold War escalated\nand this espionage became known, domestic communism came to be seen\nas a threat to national security. But the attempt to eliminate that threat soon turned into the longest lasting\nand most widespread episode of political repression \nin American history. Spurred on by a network of bureaucrats, politicians, journalists, and businessmen, the campaign wildly exaggerated\nthe danger of communist subversion. The people behind it harassed anyone suspected of holding \nleft-of-center political views or associating with those who did. If you hung modern art on your walls, had a multiracial social circle, or signed petitions against\nnuclear weapons, you might just have been a communist. Starting in the late 1940s, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover used the resources of his agency\nto hunt down such supposed communists and eliminate them from any\nposition of influence within American society. And the narrow criteria that Hoover\nand his allies used to screen federal employees spread to the rest of the country. Soon, Hollywood studios, universities, car manufacturers, and thousands of other public\nand private employers were imposing the same political tests\non the men and women who worked for them. Meanwhile, Congress conducted \nits own witchhunt subpoenaing hundreds of people\nto testify before investigative bodies like the House Un-American \nActivities Committee. If they refused to cooperate,\nthey could be jailed for contempt, or more commonly, fired and blacklisted. Ambitious politicians, like Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy, used such hearings as a partisan weapon accusing democrats \nof being soft on communism and deliberately losing China\nto the Communist Bloc. McCarthy, a Republican senator \nfrom Wisconsin became notorious by flaunting\never-changing lists of alleged communists within the State Department. Egged on by other politicians, he continued to make \noutrageous accusations while distorting or fabricating evidence. Many citizens reviled McCarthy\nwhile others praised him. And when the Korean War broke out,\nMcCarthy seemed vindicated. Once he became chair of the Senate's permanent subcommittee\non investigations in 1953, McCarthy recklessness increased. It was his investigation of the army that \nfinally turned public opinion against him and diminished his power. McCarthy's colleagues \nin the Senate censured him and he died less than three years later,\nprobably from alcoholism. McCarthyism ended as well. It had ruined hundreds, \nif not thousands, of lives and drastically narrowed the American\npolitical spectrum. Its damage to democratic institutions\nwould be long lasting. In all likelihood, there were both\nDemocrats and Republicans who knew that the anti-communist\npurges were deeply unjust but feared that directly opposing them\nwould hurt their careers. Even the Supreme Court failed\nto stop the witchhunt, condoning serious violations\nof constitutional rights in the name of national security. Was domestic communism an actual\nthreat to the American government? Perhaps, though a small one. But the reaction to it was so extreme\nthat it caused far more damage than the threat itself. And if new demagogues appeared\nin uncertain times to attack unpopular minorities\nin the name of patriotism, could it all happen again?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the goal of McCarthyism?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rescinding democratic freedoms of citizens"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Destroying careers of politicians"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Exposing suspected communists"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Limiting governmental regulations"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How long did the era of McCarthyism last?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "One year"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Twenty-five years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Over a decade"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It never ended, it continues still today"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The American Communist party faced attacks from:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Conservatives"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Liberals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Business leaders"}, {"label": "D", "text": "B and c only"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Which organization run by J.

Thomas", "category": "Civics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-happened-to-trial-by-jury-suja-a-thomas", "transcript": {"en": "Dating back at least \nto the time of Socrates, some early societies decided\nthat certain disputes, such as whether a person committed\na particular crime, should be heard by a group of citizens. Several centuries later, trial by jury\nwas introduced to England, where it became a fundamental feature\nof the legal system, checking the government \nand involving citizens in decision-making. Juries decided whether defendants\nwould be tried on crimes, determined whether the accused\ndefendants were guilty, and resolved monetary disputes. While the American colonies eventually\ncast off England's rule, its legal tradition of the jury persisted. The United States Constitution \ninstructed a grand jury to decide whether \ncriminal cases proceeded, required a jury to try all crimes,\nexcept impeachment, and provided for juries \nin civil cases as well. Yet, in the US today,\ngrand juries often are not convened, and juries decide less than 4%\nof criminal cases and less than 1% of civil cases\nfiled in court. That's at the same time as jury systems\nin other countries are growing. So what happened in the U.S.? Part of the story lies in how the Supreme\nCourt has interpreted the Constitution. It's permitted plea bargaining, which now occurs in almost \nevery criminal case. The way it works is the prosecutor\npresents the accused with a decision of whether \nto plead guilty. If they accept the plea, the case won't\ngo in front of a jury, but they'll receive \na shorter prison sentence than they'd get if \na jury did convict them. The risk of a much greater \nprison sentence after a trial can frighten even an innocent defendant\ninto taking a plea. Between the 19th century \nand the 21st century, the proportion of guilty pleas\nhas increased from around 20% to 90%, and the numbers continue to grow. The Supreme Court has permitted\nthe use of another procedure that interferes with the jury called summary judgement. Using summary judgement, judges can\ndecide that civil trials are unnecessary if the people who sue \nhave insufficient evidence. This is intended only for cases\nwhere no reasonable jury would disagree. That's a difficult thing \nto determine, yet usage of summary judgement\nhas stretched to the point where some would argue it's being abused. For instance, judges grant fully,\nor in part, over 70% of employers' requests to dismiss employment \ndiscrimination cases. In other cases, both the person who sues\nand the person who defends forgo their right to go to court, instead resolving their dispute through\na professional arbitrator. These are generally lawyers, professors,\nor former judges. Arbitration can be a smart decision\nby both parties to avoid the requirements \nof a trial in court, but it's often agreed to unwittingly\nwhen people sign contracts like employment applications\nand consumer agreements. That can become a problem. For example, some arbitrators \nmay be biased towards the companies\nthat give them cases. These are just some of the ways\nin which juries have disappeared. But could the disappearance of juries\nbe a good thing? Well, juries aren't perfect. They're costly, time-consuming, and may make errors. And they're not always necessary, like when people can simply agree\nto settle their disputes. But juries have their advantages. When properly selected, jurors are more representative of\nthe general population and don't have the same incentives\nas prosecutors, legislators, or judges seeking reelection or promotion. The founders of the United States trusted\nin the wisdom of impartial groups of citizens to check the power of all three branches\nof government. And the jury trial itself has given\nordinary citizens a central role in upholding\nthe social fabric.

Maybe twice that much if they’ve had Taco\nBell. Seven and a half billion of us on Earth? That’s a literal mountain of human poop\nevery day. Yet most of *us* get to pretend it doesn’t\nexist, all thanks to an invention that has improved health and quality of life more than\nany other in humanity’s history. [OPEN BUMPER] Bears do it in the woods, whales do it in the ocean, and 2.4 *billion* of us DON’T\ndo it in a toilet. Dysentery, typhoid, parasites, and other infections\nlead to hundreds of thousands of deaths every year, all because one in three people alive\nin 2017 don’t have access to toilets and latrines. From on top of our porcelain thrones, we’ve\nleft a lot of our species drowning in feces. Nearly a *billion* people still defecate out\nin the open: in street gutters, open water, or… in the woods. Thousands of years ago, we all did it that\nway, but as we developed agriculture and settled into towns, poop started piling up. Around five thousand years ago, Neolithic\nvillagers constructed the first known toilets at Skara Brae. At the same time, many houses in Mohenjo Daro,\nfeatured toilets complete with drains, people washed their poop into sewers that emptied\ninto the Indus River. It’d be thousands of years before we linked\ngerms to disease, but avoiding filth has deep evolutionary roots. Bodily excretions, death, and rotten smells\ncan be signs of danger or disease, triggering our innate sense of disgust. This biological instinct ended up in the moral\ncodes of many religions, like this passage from the Old Testament instructing the Hebrews\nto do their Exodus in a… hole-y fashion. Roman society was comfortable with caca. At one point, Rome had 144 public toilets…\nlong open benches that emptied into the Cloaca Maxima, a sewer system that carried waste\nto the Tiber river. But the vast majority of Romans simply pooped\nin a pot and threw it into the street. As waste and disease piled up, Romans pointed\nto the stink as the cause of sickness. After the Roman Empire faded away, this connection\nbetween bad air and bad health persisted, clogging up toilet innovation for more than\na thousand years. During medieval outbreaks like the Plague,\ndoctors wore pointed masks, filled with strong herbs or perfumes to “cleanse” bad air,\nwhich they believed to be the cause of disease. They were wrong, but this obsession with stink\nwould change the world in ways no one saw coming. Contrary to popular belief, Thomas Crapper\ndidn’t invent the flush toilet. That honor goes to John Harington, his “Ajax”\ndevice emptied the bowl with water from an overhead tank. But flush toilets didn’t catch on until\n1775, when Alexander Cummings revolutionized the way we poo by adding a water-filled “S\ntrap” to block explosive, and supposedly disease-causing sewer gas from rising up the\npipes, the same basic toilet design we still use today. During the Industrial Revolution, most people’s\nbusiness still ended up in streets and cesspools, and the growing population was too big a load\nfor London’s sewers. By the mid-1800s, the city was literally overflowing\nwith crap. With crap comes cholera, an infection from\nbacteria whose toxins basically cause all the water in your body to pour out of your\nbutt in the form of diarrhea, death by dehydration. Cholera hit London in 1854. Instead of the “old bad air” theory, a\ndoctor named John Snow believed cholera was transmitted by drinking water tainted with\nsewage. Snow’s map of cholera cases clustered around\na water pump. When he when he removed the pump’s handle,\nnew cholera cases fell. Soon after, London enclosed its sewers and\ndiverted waste downstream of London, but doctors wouldn’t totally accept Snow’s ideas for\nnearly 50 years. The Great Depression saw an expansion of sewage\ntreatment plants–and modern toilet paper!–and this is basically the sanitation system we\nhave today, where magical chairs make nasty things disappear, out of sight, out of smell,\nand out of mind. It’s no three sea shells but we've come a long way. …and this privileged pooping existence lets\nus keep something else out of mind: The 2.4 BILLION people who still don’t have toilets. Nearly 800,000 children under 5 still die\nevery year from diarrhea. More than AIDS, more than malaria. That’s an Airbus A380 full of children crashing\nevery 6 hours. It’s estimated last year poor sanitation\ncost the global economy $260 billion, due to illness, loss of income, and years of life\nlost. Worse, women suffer these impacts disproportionately\nto men. In 2007, readers of the BMJ voted “modern\nsanitation” as the #1 medical advance since 1840. Not antibiotics, not vaccines. Toilets and clean water. We *have* made progress. Since 1990, 14% more people have access to\nsanitation, and *many* fewer are dying, but fewer is not zero. With a little effort, we can *wipe* this problem\nfrom the Earth. On the TV show “The Brady Bunch”, their\nbathroom didn’t even have a toilet. Pooping is so taboo, it was *literally* invisible. We can’t even talk about it! It’s no coincidence that many of our worst\nswear words involve defecation. In her book The Big Necessity, Rose George\nwrites: “How a society disposes of its human excrement is an indication of how it treats\nits humans too” Everybody poops, and every person who is born\nshould be able to do it safely. Stay curious! And please… always wash your hands when you’re done. Hey everyone, as always, thank you for watching\nand learning with us. This week’s video was a stinky but important\nsubject, and it was brought to you thanks to the support of Bill and Melinda Gates. For years, Bill and Melinda Gates have supported\nefforts around the world to make people healthier and make their lives better through innovation,\neducation, and investing in projects to build a better future. And it’s working! Since 1990, an estimated **122 million** children’s\nlives have been saved, thanks to things like better nutrition, family planning, economic\nopportunities, and vaccines. Here’s some proof: In 1988 there were more\nthan 350,000 cases of polio. And last year? Only 34. Things have gotten a LOT better, and one day\nsoon, that number *can be, and will be zero*.

{"page": 91, "lesson": 10, "title": "What happens during a heart attack? - Krishna Sudhir", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-happens-during-a-heart-attack-krishna-sudhir", "transcript": {"en": "Approximately 7 million people around the \nworld die from heart attacks every year, and cardiovascular disease, which causes heart attacks and other\nproblems like strokes, is the world's leading killer. So what causes a heart attack? Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen, and during a heart attack,\nit can't get enough. Fatty deposits, or plaques, develop on the walls \nof our coronary arteries. Those are the vessels that supply\noxygenated blood to the heart. These plaques grow as we age, sometimes getting chunky, hardened, or enflamed. Eventually, the plaques can turn\ninto blockages. If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks, a blood clot will form around it\nin minutes, and a partially closed artery\ncan become completely blocked. Blood flow is cut off \nto the cardiac muscle and the oxygen-starved cells start to die\nwithin several minutes. This is a myocardial infarction, or heart attack. Things can rapidly deteriorate\nin the absence of treatment. The injured muscle may not be able\nto pump blood as well, and its rhythm might be thrown off. In the worst case scenario,\na heart attack can cause sudden death. And how do you know that someone\nis having a heart attack? The most common symptom is chest pain caused by the oxygen-deprived \nheart muscle. Patients describe it as crushing\nor vice-like. It can radiate to the left arm, jaw, back, or abdomen. But it's not always as sudden and dramatic\nas it is in the movies. Some people experience nausea or shortness of breath. Symptoms may be less prominent\nin women and the elderly. For them, weakness and tiredness\nmay be the main signal. And surprisingly, in many people, especially those with diabetes,\nwhich affects the nerves that carry pain, a heart attack may be silent. If you think that someone might be \nhaving a heart attack, the most important thing \nis to respond quickly. If you have access to emergency medical\nservices, call them. They're the fastest way \nto get to a hospital. Taking aspirin, which thins the blood, and nitroglycerin, \nwhich opens up the artery, can help keep the heart attack\nfrom getting worse. In the emergency room, \ndoctors can diagnose a heart attack. They commonly use an electrocardiogram to measure the heart's \nelectrical activity and a blood test to assess \nheart muscle damage. The patient is then taken to a high-tech\ncardiac suite where tests are done \nto locate the blockages. Cardiologists can reopen \nthe blocked artery by inflating it with a balloon\nin a procedure called an angioplasty. Frequently, they also insert a metal\nor polymer stent that will hold the artery open. More extensive blockages might require\ncoronary artery bypass surgery. Using a piece of vein or artery\nfrom another part of the body, heart surgeons can reroute blood flow\naround the blockage. These procedures reestablish circulation\nto the cardiac muscle, restoring heart function. Heart attack treatment is advancing, but prevention is vital. Genetics and lifestyle factors\nboth affect your risk. And the good news is that you can\nchange your lifestyle. Exercise, a healthy diet,\nand weight loss all lower the risk of heart attacks, whether you've had one before or not. Doctors recommend exercising\na few times a week, doing both aerobic activity\nand strength training. A heart-healthy diet is low\nin sugar and saturated fats, which are both linked to heart disease. So what should you eat? Lots of fiber from vegetables, chicken and fish instead of red meat, whole grains and nuts like walnuts\nand almonds all seem to be beneficial. A good diet and exercise plan can also\nkeep your weight in a healthy range, which will lower \nyour heart attack risk as well. And of course, medications can also\nhelp prevent heart attacks. Doctors often prescribe low-dose\naspirin, for example, particularly for patients who've\nalready had a heart attack and for those known to be\nat high risk. And drugs that help manage risk factors, like high blood pressure, cholesterol,\nand diabetes, will make heart attacks less likely, too. Heart attacks may be common, \nbut they don't have to be inevitable. A healthy diet, avoiding tobacco use, staying fit, and enjoying plenty of sleep\nand lots of laughter all go a long way in making sure\nyour body's most important muscle keeps on beating."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many deaths occur annually around the world from cardiovascular disease?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "500,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "7 million"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100 million"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What are the blood vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the heart called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carotid arteries"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Coronary arteries"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pulmonary arteries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Aorta"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the commonest symptom that heralds the onset of a heart attack?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shortness of breath"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nausea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fatigue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chest pain"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In the hospital, which of the following treatments might be used for a patient with a blocked artery?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Balloon angioplasty"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stenting"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bypass surgery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "All of the following can reduce the risk of heart attacks except which one?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Regular exercise"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sleep deprivation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Low dose aspirin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Diabetes control"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

The location was apparently empty,\nand the whole endeavor was risky. What, if anything, was going to show up? Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours\nof exposure of that same area. And what came back \nwas nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver \nof the universe. Now, let's take a step back to understand\nthe scale of this image. If you were to take a ballpoint pen and hold it at arm's length \nin front of the night sky, focusing on its very tip, that is what the Hubble Telescope captured\nin its first Deep Field image. In other words, those 3,000 galaxies were seen \nin just a tiny speck of the universe, approximately one two-millionth\nof the night sky. To put all this in perspective, the average human measures\nabout 1.7 meters. With Earth's diameter \nat 12,700 kilometers, that's nearly 7.5 million humans\nlined up head to toe. The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance\nof 380,000 kilometers to the moon. And our relatively small Sun has a\ndiameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, or 110 times the Earth's diameter. A step further, the Milky Way holds somewhere \nbetween 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured\nin the Deep Field image contains billions of stars\nat the very least. Almost a decade after taking\nthe Deep Field image, scientists adjusted the optics\non the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure\nover a period of about four months. This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies. Half of these galaxies have since been\nanalyzed more clearly in what's known as \nthe eXtreme Deep Field image, or XDF. By combining over ten years \nof photographs, the XDF shows galaxies so distant that they're only \none ten-billionth the brightness that the human eye can perceive. So, what can we learn about the universe\nfrom the Deep Field images? In a study of the universe, space and time\nare inextricably linked. That's because of \nthe finite speed of light. So the Deep Field images are like\ntime machines to the ancient universe. They reach so far into space and time that we can observe galaxies\nthat existed over 13 billion years ago. This means we're looking\nat the universe as it was less than a billion years \nafter the Big Bang, and it allows scientists to research\ngalaxies in their infancy. The Deep Field images have also shown\nthat the universe is homogeneous. That is, images taken at different\nspots in the sky look similar.

Imagine winning a multi-million dollar\nlottery tomorrow. If you're like many of us,\nyou'd be ecstatic, unable to believe your good luck. But would that joy still be there\na few years later? Maybe not. A famous study of 22 lottery winners\nshowed that months after winning, their average reported levels of happiness\nhad increased no more than that of a control group \nwho hadn't won the lottery. Some were actually unhappier\nthan they had been before winning. And later studies have confirmed that\nour emotional well-being, how often and how intensely \nwe feel things like joy, sorrow, anxiety, or anger, don't seem to improve with wealth\nor status beyond a certain point. This has to do with a phenomenon\nknown as hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill. It describes our tendency to adapt\nto new situations to maintain a stable \nemotional equilibrium. When it comes to feeling happy, most of us seem to have a base level that\nstays more or less constant throughout our existence. Of course, the novelty of better food, superior vacations, and more beautiful homes can at first make you feel like you're\nwalking on air, but as you get used to those things, you revert to your \ndefault emotional state. That might sound pretty gloomy, but hedonic adaptation makes us \nless emotionally sensitive to any kind of change, including negative ones. The study with the lottery winners also looked at people who had suffered \nan accident that left them paralyzed. When asked several months after\ntheir accidents how happy they were, they reported levels of happiness\napproaching their original baseline. So while the hedonic treadmill may\ninhibit our enjoyment of positive changes, it seems to also enable our resilience\nin recovering from adversity. There are other reasons \nthat winning the lottery may not make us happier in the long run. It can be difficult to manage\nlarge sums of money, and some lottery winners wind up\nspending or losing it all quickly. It can also be socially isolating. Some winners experience a deluge of\nunwelcome requests for money, so they wind up cutting themselves off\nfrom others. And wealth may actually make us meaner. In one study, participants played\na rigged game of monopoly where the experimenters made\nsome players rich quickly. The wealthy players started\npatronizing the poorer players and hogging the snacks \nthey were meant to share. But just because a huge influx of cash isn't guaranteed to bring \njoy into your life doesn't mean that money \ncan never make us happier. Findings show that we adapt to extrinsic\nand material things, like a new car or a bigger house, much faster than we do \nto novel experiences, like visiting a new place\nor learning a new skill. So by that reasoning, the more you spend money\non experiences rather than things, the happier you'd be. And there's another way to turn\nyour money into happiness: spend it on other people. In one study, participants were\ngiven some money and were either asked to spend it\non themselves or on someone else. Later that evening, researchers called up\nthese participants and asked them how happy they were. The happiness levels of those who had\nspent the money on others were significantly greater than that\nof those who had spent it on themselves. And that seems to be true \naround the world. Another study examined the generosity\nof over 200,000 people from 136 countries. In over 90% of these countries, people who donated tended to be happier\nthan those who didn't. But this may all be easier said than done. Let's say a million dollars \nfalls into your lap tomorrow.

{"page": 91, "lesson": 13, "title": "Everything you need to know to read Homer's \"Odyssey\" - Jill Dash", "category": "Literature", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/everything-you-need-to-know-to-read-homer-s-odyssey-jill-dash", "transcript": {"en": "A close encounter with\na man-eating giant, a sorceress who turns men into pigs, a long-lost king taking back his throne. On their own, any of these make\ngreat stories, but each is just one episode\nin the \"Odyssey,\" a 12,000-line poem spanning years of\nAncient Greek history, myth, and legend. How do we make sense \nof such a massive text that comes from and tells of a world\nso far away? The fact that we can read the \"Odyssey\"\nat all is pretty incredible, as it was composed before the Greek\nalphabet appeared in the 8th century BCE. It was made for listeners \nrather than readers, and was performed by oral poets\ncalled rhapsodes. Tradition identifies its author\nas a blind man named Homer. But no one definitively knows whether\nhe was real or legendary. The earliest mentions of him occur\ncenturies after his era. And the poems attributed to him\nseem to have been changed and rearranged many times\nby multiple authors before finally being written down\nin their current form. In fact, the word rhapsode means\nstitching together, as these poets combined existing stories,\njokes, myths, and songs into a single narrative. To recite these massive epics live, rhapsodes employed a steady meter, along with mnemonic devices, like repetition of memorized passages\nor set pieces. These included descriptions of scenery\nand lists of characters, and helped the rhapsode keep\ntheir place in the narrative, just as the chorus or bridge of a song\nhelps us to remember the next verses. Because most of the tales were familiar\nto the audience, it was common to hear the sections\nof the poem out of order. At some point, the order \nbecame set in stone and the story was locked into place\nas the one we read today. But since the world has changed\na bit in the last several thousand years, it helps to have some background\nbefore jumping in. The \"Odyssey\" itself is a sequel to Homer's\nother famous epic, the \"Iliad,\" which tells the story of the Trojan War. If there's one major theme uniting\nboth poems, it's this: do not, under any circumstances,\nincur the wrath of the gods. The Greek Pantheon is a dangerous mix\nof divine power and human insecurity, prone to jealousy and grudges\nof epic proportions. And many of the problems faced by humans\nin the poems are caused by their hubris, or excessive pride in believing themselves\nsuperior to the gods. The desire to please the gods was so great that the Ancient Greeks traditionally\nwelcomed all strangers into their homes with generosity for fear that the strangers \nmight be gods in disguise. This ancient code of hospitality\nwas called xenia. It involved hosts providing their guests\nwith safety, food, and comfort, and the guests returning the favor\nwith courtesy and gifts if they had them. Xenia has a significant role \nin the \"Odyssey,\" where Odysseus in his wanderings\nis the perpetual guest, while in his absence, his clever wife\nPenelope plays non-stop host. The \"Odyssey\" recounts all \nof Odysseus's years of travel, but the narrative begins in medias res\nin the middle of things. Ten years after the Trojan War,\nwe find our hero trapped on an island, still far from his native Ithaca and\nthe family he hasn't seen for 20 years. Because he's angered the sea god Poseidon\nby blinding his son, a cyclops, Odysseus's passage home has been\nfraught with mishap after mishap. With trouble brewing at home\nand gods discussing his fate, Odysseus begins the account\nof those missing years to his hosts. One of the most fascinating things\nabout the \"Odyssey\" is the gap between how little we know\nabout its time period and the wealth of detail the text\nitself contains. Historians, linguists, and archeologists have spent centuries \nsearching for the ruins of Troy and identifying which islands\nOdysseus visited. Just like its hero, the 24-book epic\nhas made its own long journey through centuries of myth and history to tell us its incredible story today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When did the Greek alphabet first appear?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1000 CE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "8th century BCE"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2nd century BCE"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No one knows for sure"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following elements helped the rhapsodes remember and recite the poem?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stories that were familiar to audiences"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Organizing the poem into sections"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Memorized passages, or “set pieces”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The fact that \"Odyssey\" is a sequel to \"Iliad\""}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following themes unites both \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The kindness of strangers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The exemplary leadership of Achilles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The strength of the Greek city-state"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Characters’ hubris in thinking themselves superior to the gods"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is xenia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wrath of the gods"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Excessive pride"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A code of hospitality"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The specific meter used by the rhapsodes"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which god has hindered Odysseus’ journey home?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Poseidon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Athena"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Aphrodite"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Zeus"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
