If we broke open all their newest phones, which are just a fraction \nof the total that’ve been built, and split them into their component parts, that would produce \naround 85,000 kilograms of gold, 875,000 of silver, and 40 million kilograms of copper. How did this precious cache \nget into our phones, and can we reclaim it? Gold, silver, and copper \nare actually just a few of the 70 or so chemical elements \nthat make up the average smartphone. These can be divided \ninto different groups, two of the most critical \nbeing rare earth elements and precious metals. Rare earths are a selection of 17 elements\nthat are actually common in Earth’s crust and are found in many areas across \nthe world in low concentrations. These elements have a huge\nrange of magnetic, phosphorescent, and conductive properties that make them crucial \nto modern technologies. In fact, of the 17 types \nof rare earth metals, phones and other electronics \nmay contain up to 16. In smartphones, these create the screen \nand color display, aid conductivity, and produce the signature vibrations, amongst other things. And yet, crucial as they are, extracting these elements from the earth is linked to some disturbing \nenvironmental impacts. Rare earth elements can often be found, but in many areas, it’s not economically feasible \nto extract them due to low concentrations. Much of the time, extracting them requires \na method called open pit mining that exposes vast areas of land. This form of mining destroys \nhuge swaths of natural habitats, and causes air and water pollution, threatening the health \nof nearby communities. Another group of ingredients \nin smartphones comes with similar environmental risks: these are metals such as copper, silver, palladium, aluminum, platinum, tungsten, tin, lead, and gold. We also mine magnesium, lithium, silica, and potassium to make phones, and all of it is associated \nwith vast habitat destruction, as well as air and water pollution. Mining comes with \nworrying social problems, too, like large-scale human \nand animal displacement to make way for industrial operations, and frequently, \npoor working conditions for laborers. Lastly, phone production \nalso requires petroleum, one of the main drivers of climate change. That entwines our smartphones inextricably\nwith this growing planetary conundrum. And, what’s more, the ingredients we mine \nto make our phones aren’t infinite. One day, they’ll simply run out, and we haven’t yet discovered effective \nreplacements for some. Despite this, the number of smartphones \nis on a steady increase; by 2019 it’s predicted that \nthere’ll be close to 3 billion in use. This means that reclaiming the bounty \nwithin our phones is swiftly becoming a necessity. So, if you have an old phone, you might want to consider your options \nbefore throwing it away. To minimize waste, you could donate it \nto a charity for reuse, take it to an e-waste recycling facility, or look for a company \nthat refurbishes old models. However, even recycling companies \nneed our scrutiny. Just as the production of smartphones comes with social \nand environmental problems, dismantling them does too. E-waste is sometimes intentionally \nexported to countries where labor is cheap \nbut working conditions are poor. Vast workforces, \noften made up of women and children, may be underpaid, lack the training \nto safely disassemble phones, and be exposed to elements \nlike lead and mercury, which can permanently damage \ntheir nervous systems. Phone waste can also end up \nin huge dump sites, leaching toxic chemicals \ninto the soil and water, mirroring the problems of the mines \nwhere the elements originated. A phone is much more than it appears \nto be on the surface. It’s an assemblage of elements\nfrom multiple countries, linked to impacts \nthat are unfolding on a global scale. So, until someone invents \na completely sustainable smartphone, we’ll need to come to terms with how this technology\naffects widespread places and people."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Approximately how many chemical elements are found in a smartphone?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "25"}, {"label": "B", "text": "55"}, {"label": "C", "text": "70"}, {"label": "D", "text": "110"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is a characteristic of a rare earth element?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There are about 17 different ones"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are relatively common in Earth’s crust, but only found in small amounts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are found in many areas in Earth’s crust"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They have many uses in smartphones"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of these are characteristics"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "How might smartphones linked to climate change?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They produce carbon dioxide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They have components that use oil in their production"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They produce heat during their use"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of these reasons"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the predicted number of smartphones that will be in use in 2019?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2.3 billion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1 billion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "3 billion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7.3 billion"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What might be an issue for the workers hired to dismantle old smartphones?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lack of training on how to safely reclaim metals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Poor wages"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Unsafe working conditions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of these are potential issues"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 24, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why cockroaches are so hard to kill", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/nkQu7b2G", "transcript": {"en": "- [Narrator] You might not\nwant to think about this, but over 3500 species of cockroaches live on this planet. The good news? Only about 30 of those species have adapted to live around humans. The bad news? 30 species of cockroaches\ncan live around us! Roaches are one of the most\ncommon pests in the US. So it's no surprise that humans are always trying to kill them. But no matter how many\ntimes we stomp them, squash them, and bomb\nthem with toxic chemicals, these pesky pests always seem\nto pop up time and time again. So what's going on? Let's take a closer look at the roach you probably know better than you'd like. Periplaneta Americana. Aka, the American Cockroach. But this name is misleading. This guy is actually\nfrom Africa, not America. It made its way to the US by infesting boats in the 16th century, and it's been spreading to\nalmost every corner in the world ever since. It turns out, it's one of the largest\nspecies of cockroach around. But that's not the only\nbig thing about it. New research has revealed\nthat it has a massive genome. One of the largest of any studied insect. And may of these genes are\nexactly what make this roach a master survivor. Let's start with the genes associated with something called Chemoreception. That's how roaches smell\nand taste their environment. Turns out they're actually way better at sniffing out and eating\nfood than most other insects. The American roach has 154\nolfactory receptors for smell, and 544 gustatory receptors for taste. More than any other insect on the planet. As a result, these cockroaches\nare not picky eaters. Sure, they like cheese, meat\nand sugar like the rest of us, but they'll also go for\nthings like cardboard, book bindings, human\ntoenails, rotting meat, blood, excrement, and even each other. That's right, these\nroaches have been known to eat other dead or crippled cockroaches, all in the name of survival. It sounds gross, but this diverse diet makes it easy to find a\nmeal just about anywhere, even if it's poisonous to most animals. This roach has a bunch of\ngenes called Cytochrome P450s, which help it withstand\npoisonous chemicals, like peppermint. These genes code for\ndetoxification enzymes, which keep the insect safe. On top of that, this roach has\na super-strong immune system that seeks out and kills\nharmful microbes and fungi, making the most unsanitary environment look like a five-start hotel\nto the American cockroach. Not gross enough yet? Well consider this. Cockroaches can live nearly\na week without their heads. Yeah, that's not a myth. They don't have a highly\npressurized network of blood vessels like humans,\nso they don't bleed out. Instead, their necks actually\nseal off the opening. They can't regenerate a whole head, but roaches to have an impressive set of regenerative superpowers. For up to the first two years of its life, the American roach goes through a series of regenerative molts as\nit matures into an adult. During a single molt stage,\nit can replace lost limbs. And over a series of molts,\nit can regrow antennae and even its eyes. Roaches may be hard to kill, but there's an easy way to keep\nthem clear of your kitchen. Cleanliness. A roach just won't survive\nin unsanitary conditions, it actually enjoys it. Its heightened senses mean it actually relishes rotting food. So, store food in airtight containers. Cover trash bins, and\nkeep your basement dry. It might also be smart to\nplug holes in your walls, unused electrical outlets,\nand especially drains, since get this, roaches can use your plumbing\nto climb up from sewers into your bathroom sink. It might not eliminate the risk entirely, but it can't hurt, and it will certainly\nmake you feel better. However, we can't promise\nit will keep them out of your nightmares.

The goddess Hera, who hated Hercules \nfor being born of her husband’s adultery, had stricken him \nwith a temporary curse of madness. And his own family were the casualties. Consumed by grief, Hercules sought out \nthe Oracle of Delphi, who told him the path to atonement lay\nwith his cousin, King Eurystheus of Tiryns, \na favorite of Hera’s. Eurystheus hoped to humiliate Hercules \nwith ten impossible tasks that pitted him against \ninvincible monsters and unfathomable forces. Instead, the king set the stage \nfor an epic series of adventures that would come to be known \nas the Labors of Hercules. The first labor was \nto slay the Nemean Lion, who kidnapped women \nand devoured warriors. Its golden fur was impervious to arrows, but Hercules cornered \nthe lion in its dark cave, stunned it with a club, and strangled it with his bare hands. He found no tool sharp enough \nto skin the beast, until the goddess Athena suggested \nusing one of its own claws. Hercules returned to Tiryns \nwearing the lion’s hide, frightening King Eurystheus so much \nthat he hid in a wine jar. From then on, Hercules was ordered to present his trophies \nat a safe distance. The second target was the Lernaean Hydra,\na giant serpent with many heads. Hercules fought fiercely, but every time he cut one head off,\ntwo more grew in its place. The battle was hopeless until his nephew Iolaus thought \nto cauterize the necks with fire, keeping the heads from regrowing. The dead serpent’s remains \nbecame the Hydra constellation. Instead of slaying a beast, \nHercules next had to catch one, alive. The Ceryneian Hind was a female deer \nso fast it could outrun an arrow. Hercules tracked it for a year, finally trapping it in the northern land \nof Hyperborea. The animal turned out to be sacred \nto Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Hercules swore to return it. When Eurystheus saw the hind, \nhe demanded to keep it instead, but as soon as Hercules let go,\nthe animal ran to its mistress. Thus, Hercules completed his task \nwithout breaking his promise. The fourth mission was to capture \nthe Erymanthian boar, which had ravaged many fields. Advised by the wise centaur Chiron, Hercules trapped it \nby chasing it into thick snow. For the fifth task, there were no animals,\njust their leftovers. The stables where King Augeas \nkept his hundreds of divine cattle had not been maintained in ages. Hercules promised to clean them in one day if he could keep one-tenth \nof the livestock. Augeas expected the hero to fail. Instead, Hercules dug massive trenches, rerouting two nearby rivers to flow \nthrough the stables until they were spotless. Next came three more beastly foes, each requiring \na clever strategy to defeat. The carnivorous Stymphalian birds \nnested in an impenetrable swamp, but Hercules used Athena’s special rattle \nto frighten them into the air, at which point he shot them down. No mortal could stand before \nthe Cretan bull’s mad rampage, but a chokehold \nfrom behind did the trick. And the mad King Diomedes, who had trained his horses \nto devour his guests, got a taste of his own medicine when Hercules wrestled him \ninto his own stables. The ensuing feast calmed the beasts \nenough for Hercules to bind their mouths. But the ninth labor involved someone \nmore dangerous than any beast, Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons. Hercules was to retrieve the belt given\nto her by her father Ares, the god of war. He sailed to the Amazon land of Themyscira\nprepared for battle, but the queen was so impressed \nwith the hero and his exploits that she gave the belt willingly. For his tenth labor, Hercules had to steal a herd \nof magical red cattle from Geryon, a giant with three heads and three bodies. On his way, Hercules was so annoyed \nby the Libyan desert heat that he shot an arrow at the Sun. The sun god Helios admired \nthe hero’s strength and lent his chariot for the journey \nto the island of Erytheia. There, Hercules fought off \nGeryon’s herdsman and his two-headed dog, \nbefore killing the giant himself. That should have been the end. But Eurystheus announced \nthat two labors hadn’t counted: the Hydra, because Iolaus \nhad helped Hercules kill it, and the stables, \nbecause he’d accepted payment. And so, the hero set \nabout his eleventh task, obtaining golden apples from \nthe garden of the Hesperides nymphs. Hercules began by catching \nthe Old Man of the Sea and holding the shape-shifting water-god\nuntil he revealed the garden’s location. Once there, the hero found the titan Atlas\nholding up the heavens. Hercules offered to take his place \nif Atlas would retrieve the apples. Atlas eagerly complied, but Hercules then\ntricked him into trading places again, escaping with apples in hand. The twelfth and final task \nwas to bring back Cerberus, the three-headed hound \nguarding the underworld. Helped by Hermes and Athena, \nHercules descended and met Hades himself. The lord of the dead allowed Hercules \nto take the beast if he could do it without weapons, which he achieved by grabbing \nall three of its heads at once. When he presented the hound \nto a horrified Eurystheus, the king finally declared \nthe hero’s service complete. After 12 years of toil, Hercules had redeemed the tragic deaths \nof his family and earned a place in the divine pantheon. But his victory held \nan even deeper importance. In overcoming the chaotic \nand monstrous forces of the world, the hero swept away what remained \nof the Titans’ primordial order, reshaping it into one \nwhere humanity could thrive. Through his labors, Hercules tamed the world’s madness \nby atoning for his own."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was Eurystheus’s relationship to Hercules?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He was his brother"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He was his father-in-law"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He was his cousin"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why didn’t Hercules give the Ceryneian Hind to Eurystheus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He’d sworn to return it to Artemis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He wanted to keep it for himself"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eurystheus was too frightened by it"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What special item did Hercules need to defeat the Stymphalian birds?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Nemean lion’s hide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Athena’s rattle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hippolyta’s belt"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which god helped Hercules reach Geryon’s island?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Poseidon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hermes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Helios"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following labors was deemed invalid by Eurystheus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Ceryneian Hind"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Hydra"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cerberus"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Your engineering team has developed \nan elegant probe to study it. The probe is a collection \nof 27 cube modules capable of running all the scientific \ntests necessary to analyze the monolith. The modules can self-assemble \ninto a large 3x3x3 cube, with each individual module\nplaced anywhere in the cube, and at any orientation. It can also break itself apart \nand reassemble into any other orientation. Now comes your job. The probe will need a special \nprotective coating for each of the extreme\nenvironments it passes through. The red coating will seal it against \nthe cold of deep space, the purple coating will protect it \nfrom the intense heat as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729, and the green coating will shield it \nfrom the alien planet’s electric storms. You can apply the coatings to each of\nthe faces of all 27 of the cubic modules in any way you like, but each face can only \ntake a single color coating. You need to figure out how you \ncan apply the colors so the cubes can re-assemble themselves\nto show only red, then purple, then green. How can you apply the colored coatings \nto the 27 cubes so the probe will be able \nto make the trip? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out yourself. You can start by painting the outside \nof the complete cube red, since you’ll need that regardless. Then you can break it into 27 pieces, \nand look at what you have. There are 8 corner cubes, \nwhich each have three red faces, 12 edge cubes, \nwhich have two red faces, 6 face cubes, which have 1 red face, and a single center cube, \nwhich has no red faces. You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red \nat this point, so you’ll need the same number of faces \nfor the green and purple cubes, too. When you’re done, \nyou’ll have painted 54 faces red, 54 faces green, and 54 faces purple. That’s 162 faces, which is precisely \nhow many the cubes have in total. So there’s no margin for waste. If there’s any way to do this,\nit’ll probably be highly symmetrical. Maybe you can use that to help you. You look at the center cube. You’d better paint it half green \nand half purple, so you can use it as a corner \nfor each of those cubes, and not waste a single face. There’ll need to be center cubes\nwith no green and no purple too. So you take 2 corner cubes \nfrom the red cube and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple, and the 3 blank faces of the other green. Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes \nthat each have 1 face painted red. That leaves 5 empty faces on each. You can split them in half. In the first group, \nyou paint 3 faces green and 2 faces purple; In the second group, \npaint 3 faces purple and 2 green. Counting on symmetry, you replicate these piles again\nwith the colors rearranged. That gives you 6 with 1 green face, 6 with 1 red face, and 6 with 1 purple face. Counting up \nwhat you’ve completely painted, you see 8 corner cubes in each color, 6 edge cubes in each color, 6 face cubes in each color, and 1 center cube. That means you just need 6 more edge cubes\nin green and purple. And there are exactly 6 cubes left,\neach with 4 empty faces. You paint 2 faces of each green \nand 2 faces of each purple. And now you have a cube that’s perfectly \npainted to make an incredible trip. It rearranges itself \nto be red in deep space, purple as it enters RH-1729’s atmosphere, and green when it flies through \nthe electric storms. As it reaches the monolith, you realize you’ve achieved \nsomething humans have dreamt of for eons: alien contact."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Once you have painted the entire probe red, how many of the 27 cubes have exactly 3 of their faces painted red?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many of the 27 cubes have exactly 2 of their faces painted red?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How many of the 27 cubes have exactly 1 of their faces painted red?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many of the 27 cubes have exactly 0 of their faces painted red?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many faces need to be painted altogether?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "54"}, {"label": "B", "text": "100"}, {"label": "C", "text": "62"}, {"label": "D", "text": "162"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 24, "lesson": 5, "title": "Math is the hidden secret to understanding the world - Roger Antonsen", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/m9hD2tyM", "transcript": {"en": "Hi. I want to talk about understanding,\nand the nature of understanding, and what the essence of understanding is, because understanding is something\nwe aim for, everyone. We want to understand things. My claim is that understanding has to do with the ability to change\nyour perspective. If you don't have that,\nyou don't have understanding. So that is my claim. And I want to focus on mathematics. Many of us think of mathematics\nas addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, percent, geometry,\nalgebra -- all that stuff. But actually, I want to talk\nabout the essence of mathematics as well. And my claim is that mathematics\nhas to do with patterns. Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern, and this pattern actually emerges\njust from drawing circles in a very particular way. So my day-to-day definition\nof mathematics that I use every day is the following: First of all, it's about finding patterns. And by \"pattern,\" I mean a connection,\na structure, some regularity, some rules that govern what we see. Second of all, I think it is about representing\nthese patterns with a language. We make up language if we don't have it, and in mathematics, this is essential. It's also about making assumptions and playing around with these assumptions\nand just seeing what happens. We're going to do that very soon. And finally, it's about doing cool stuff. Mathematics enables us\nto do so many things. So let's have a look at these patterns. If you want to tie a tie knot, there are patterns. Tie knots have names. And you can also do\nthe mathematics of tie knots. This is a left-out, right-in,\ncenter-out and tie. This is a left-in, right-out,\nleft-in, center-out and tie. This is a language we made up\nfor the patterns of tie knots, and a half-Windsor is all that. This is a mathematics book\nabout tying shoelaces at the university level, because there are patterns in shoelaces. You can do it in so many different ways. We can analyze it. We can make up languages for it. And representations\nare all over mathematics. This is Leibniz's notation from 1675. He invented a language\nfor patterns in nature. When we throw something up in the air, it falls down. Why? We're not sure, but we can represent\nthis with mathematics in a pattern. This is also a pattern. This is also an invented language. Can you guess for what? It is actually a notation system\nfor dancing, for tap dancing. That enables him as a choreographer\nto do cool stuff, to do new things, because he has represented it. I want you to think about how amazing\nrepresenting something actually is. Here it says the word \"mathematics.\" But actually, they're just dots, right? So how in the world can these dots\nrepresent the word? Well, they do. They represent the word \"mathematics,\" and these symbols also represent that word and this we can listen to. It sounds like this. (Beeps) Somehow these sounds represent\nthe word and the concept. How does this happen? There's something amazing\ngoing on about representing stuff. So I want to talk about\nthat magic that happens when we actually represent something. Here you see just lines\nwith different widths. They stand for numbers\nfor a particular book. And I can actually recommend\nthis book, it's a very nice book. (Laughter) Just trust me. OK, so let's just do an experiment, just to play around\nwith some straight lines. This is a straight line. Let's make another one. So every time we move,\nwe move one down and one across, and we draw a new straight line, right? We do this over and over and over, and we look for patterns. So this pattern emerges, and it's a rather nice pattern. It looks like a curve, right? Just from drawing simple, straight lines. Now I can change my perspective\na little bit. I can rotate it. Have a look at the curve. What does it look like? Is it a part of a circle? It's actually not a part of a circle. So I have to continue my investigation\nand look for the true pattern. Perhaps if I copy it and make some art? Well, no. Perhaps I should extend\nthe lines like this, and look for the pattern there. Let's make more lines. We do this. And then let's zoom out\nand change our perspective again. Then we can actually see that\nwhat started out as just straight lines is actually a curve called a parabola. This is represented by a simple equation, and it's a beautiful pattern. So this is the stuff that we do. We find patterns, and we represent them. And I think this is a nice\nday-to-day definition. But today I want to go\na little bit deeper, and think about\nwhat the nature of this is. What makes it possible? There's one thing\nthat's a little bit deeper, and that has to do with the ability\nto change your perspective. And I claim that when\nyou change your perspective, and if you take another point of view, you learn something new\nabout what you are watching or looking at or hearing. And I think this is a really important\nthing that we do all the time. So let's just look at\nthis simple equation, x + x = 2 • x. This is a very nice pattern,\nand it's true, because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc. We've seen this over and over,\nand we represent it like this. But think about it: this is an equation. It says that something\nis equal to something else, and that's two different perspectives. One perspective is, it's a sum. It's something you plus together. On the other hand, it's a multiplication, and those are two different perspectives. And I would go as far as to say\nthat every equation is like this, every mathematical equation\nwhere you use that equality sign is actually a metaphor. It's an analogy between two things. You're just viewing something\nand taking two different points of view, and you're expressing that in a language. Have a look at this equation. This is one of the most\nbeautiful equations. It simply says that, well, two things, they're both -1. This thing on the left-hand side is -1,\nand the other one is. And that, I think, is one\nof the essential parts of mathematics -- you take\ndifferent points of view. So let's just play around. Let's take a number. We know four-thirds.\nWe know what four-thirds is. It's 1.333, but we have to have\nthose three dots, otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds. But this is only in base 10. You know, the number system,\nwe use 10 digits. If we change that around\nand only use two digits, that's called the binary system. It's written like this. So we're now talking about the number. The number is four-thirds. We can write it like this, and we can change the base,\nchange the number of digits, and we can write it differently. So these are all representations\nof the same number. We can even write it simply,\nlike 1.3 or 1.6. It all depends on\nhow many digits you have. Or perhaps we just simplify\nand write it like this. I like this one, because this says\nfour divided by three. And this number expresses\na relation between two numbers. You have four on the one hand\nand three on the other. And you can visualize this in many ways. What I'm doing now is viewing that number\nfrom different perspectives. I'm playing around. I'm playing around with\nhow we view something, and I'm doing it very deliberately. We can take a grid. If it's four across and three up,\nthis line equals five, always. It has to be like this.\nThis is a beautiful pattern. Four and three and five. And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3, you've seen a lot of times. This is your average computer screen. 800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200 is a television or a computer screen. So these are all nice representations, but I want to go a little bit further\nand just play more with this number. Here you see two circles.\nI'm going to rotate them like this. Observe the upper-left one. It goes a little bit faster, right? You can see this. It actually goes exactly\nfour-thirds as fast. That means that when it goes\naround four times, the other one goes around three times. Now let's make two lines, and draw\nthis dot where the lines meet. We get this dot dancing around. (Laughter) And this dot comes from that number. Right? Now we should trace it. Let's trace it and see what happens. This is what mathematics is all about. It's about seeing what happens. And this emerges from four-thirds. I like to say that this\nis the image of four-thirds. It's much nicer -- (Cheers) Thank you! (Applause) This is not new. This has been known\nfor a long time, but -- (Laughter) But this is four-thirds. Let's do another experiment. Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep) This is a perfect A, 440Hz. Let's multiply it by two. We get this sound. (Beep) When we play them together,\nit sounds like this. This is an octave, right? We can do this game. We can play\na sound, play the same A. We can multiply it by three-halves. (Beep) This is what we call a perfect fifth. (Beep) They sound really nice together. Let's multiply this sound\nby four-thirds. (Beep) What happens? You get this sound. (Beep) This is the perfect fourth. If the first one is an A, this is a D. They sound like this together. (Beeps) This is the sound of four-thirds. What I'm doing now,\nI'm changing my perspective. I'm just viewing a number\nfrom another perspective. I can even do this with rhythms, right? I can take a rhythm and play\nthree beats at one time (Drumbeats) in a period of time, and I can play another sound\nfour times in that same space. (Clanking sounds) Sounds kind of boring,\nbut listen to them together. (Drumbeats and clanking sounds) (Laughter) Hey! So. (Laughter) I can even make a little hi-hat. (Drumbeats and cymbals) Can you hear this? So, this is the sound of four-thirds. Again, this is as a rhythm. (Drumbeats and cowbell) And I can keep doing this\nand play games with this number. Four-thirds is a really great number.\nI love four-thirds! (Laughter) Truly -- it's an undervalued number. So if you take a sphere and look\nat the volume of the sphere, it's actually four-thirds\nof some particular cylinder. So four-thirds is in the sphere.\nIt's the volume of the sphere. OK, so why am I doing all this? Well, I want to talk about what it means\nto understand something and what we mean\nby understanding something. That's my aim here. And my claim is that\nyou understand something if you have the ability to view it\nfrom different perspectives. Let's look at this letter.\nIt's a beautiful R, right? How do you know that? Well, as a matter of fact,\nyou've seen a bunch of R's, and you've generalized and abstracted all of these\nand found a pattern. So you know that this is an R. So what I'm aiming for here\nis saying something about how understanding\nand changing your perspective are linked. And I'm a teacher and a lecturer, and I can actually use this\nto teach something, because when I give someone else\nanother story, a metaphor, an analogy, if I tell a story\nfrom a different point of view, I enable understanding. I make understanding possible, because you have to generalize\nover everything you see and hear, and if I give you another perspective,\nthat will become easier for you. Let's do a simple example again. This is four and three.\nThis is four triangles. So this is also four-thirds, in a way. Let's just join them together. Now we're going to play a game;\nwe're going to fold it up into a three-dimensional structure. I love this. This is a square pyramid. And let's just take two of them\nand put them together. So this is what is called an octahedron. It's one of the five platonic solids. Now we can quite literally\nchange our perspective, because we can rotate it\naround all of the axes and view it from different perspectives. And I can change the axis, and then I can view it\nfrom another point of view, but it's the same thing,\nbut it looks a little different. I can do it even one more time. Every time I do this,\nsomething else appears, so I'm actually learning\nmore about the object when I change my perspective. I can use this as a tool\nfor creating understanding. I can take two of these\nand put them together like this and see what happens. And it looks a little bit\nlike the octahedron. Have a look at it if I spin\nit around like this. What happens? Well, if you take two of these,\njoin them together and spin it around, there's your octahedron again, a beautiful structure. If you lay it out flat on the floor, this is the octahedron. This is the graph structure\nof an octahedron. And I can continue doing this. You can draw three great circles\naround the octahedron, and you rotate around, so actually three great circles\nis related to the octahedron. And if I take a bicycle pump\nand just pump it up, you can see that this is also\na little bit like the octahedron. Do you see what I'm doing here? I am changing the perspective every time. So let's now take a step back -- and that's actually\na metaphor, stepping back -- and have a look at what we're doing. I'm playing around with metaphors. I'm playing around\nwith perspectives and analogies. I'm telling one story in different ways. I'm telling stories. I'm making a narrative;\nI'm making several narratives. And I think all of these things\nmake understanding possible. I think this actually is the essence\nof understanding something. I truly believe this. So this thing about changing\nyour perspective -- it's absolutely fundamental for humans. Let's play around with the Earth. Let's zoom into the ocean,\nhave a look at the ocean. We can do this with anything. We can take the ocean\nand view it up close. We can look at the waves. We can go to the beach. We can view the ocean\nfrom another perspective. Every time we do this, we learn\na little bit more about the ocean. If we go to the shore,\nwe can kind of smell it, right? We can hear the sound of the waves. We can feel salt on our tongues. So all of these\nare different perspectives. And this is the best one. We can go into the water. We can see the water from the inside. And you know what? This is absolutely essential\nin mathematics and computer science. If you're able to view\na structure from the inside, then you really learn something about it. That's somehow the essence of something. So when we do this,\nand we've taken this journey into the ocean, we use our imagination. And I think this is one level deeper, and it's actually a requirement\nfor changing your perspective. We can do a little game. You can imagine that you're sitting there. You can imagine that you're up here,\nand that you're sitting here. You can view yourselves from the outside. That's really a strange thing. You're changing your perspective. You're using your imagination, and you're viewing yourself\nfrom the outside. That requires imagination. Mathematics and computer science\nare the most imaginative art forms ever. And this thing about changing perspectives should sound a little bit familiar to you, because we do it every day. And then it's called empathy. When I view the world\nfrom your perspective, I have empathy with you. If I really, truly understand what the world looks\nlike from your perspective, I am empathetic. That requires imagination. And that is how we obtain understanding. And this is all over mathematics\nand this is all over computer science, and there's a really deep connection\nbetween empathy and these sciences. So my conclusion is the following: understanding something really deeply has to do with the ability\nto change your perspective. So my advice to you is:\ntry to change your perspective. You can study mathematics. It's a wonderful way to train your brain. Changing your perspective\nmakes your mind more flexible. It makes you open to new things, and it makes you\nable to understand things. And to use yet another metaphor: have a mind like water. That's nice. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But there’s something in space that seems more terrifying \nthan any of these – something that wipes out \neverything it comes near. Could the Earth \nbe swallowed by a black hole? A black hole is an object so dense that space and time around it \nare inescapably modified, warped into an infinite sink. Nothing, not even light,\ncan move fast enough to escape a black hole’s \ngravitational pull once it passes a certain boundary, known as the event horizon. Thus, a black hole is like a cosmic\nvacuum cleaner with infinite capacity, gobbling up everything in its path, \nand letting nothing out. To determine whether a black hole \ncould swallow the Earth, we first have to figure out \nwhere they are. But since they don’t emit light, \nhow’s that possible? Fortunately, we’re able to observe \ntheir effect on the space around them. When matter approaches a black hole, the immense gravitational field\naccelerates it to high speed. This emits an enormous amount of light. And for objects too far away \nto be sucked in, the massive gravitational force \nstill affects their orbits. If we observe several stars orbiting\naround an apparently empty point, a black hole could be leading the dance. Similarly, light that passes\nclose enough to an event horizon will be deflected in a phenomenon \nknown as gravitational lensing. Most of the black holes that we’ve found \ncan be thought of as two main types. The smaller ones, \ncalled stellar mass black holes, have a mass up to 100 times larger \nthan that of our sun. They’re formed when a massive star \nconsumes all its nuclear fuel and its core collapses. We’ve observed several of these\nobjects as close as 3000 light-years away, and there could be up to 100 million \nsmall black holes just in the Milky Way galaxy. So should we be worried? Probably not. Despite their large mass, stellar black holes only have a radius \nof around 300 kilometers or less, making the chances \nof a direct hit with us miniscule. Although because \ntheir gravitational fields can affect a planet from a large distance, they could be dangerous \neven without a direct collision. If a typical stellar-mass black hole \nwere to pass in the region of Neptune, the orbit of the Earth \nwould be considerably modified, with dire results. Still, the combination of how small \nthey are and how vast the galaxy is means that stellar black holes\ndon’t give us much to worry about. But we still have to meet the second type: supermassive black holes. These have masses millions or billions\ntimes greater than that of our sun and have event horizons that\ncould span billions of kilometers. These giants have grown \nto immense proportions by swallowing matter \nand merging with other black holes. Unlike their stellar cousins, supermassive black holes aren’t\nwandering through space. Instead, they lie at the center \nof galaxies, including our own. Our solar system is in a stable orbit \naround a supermassive black hole that resides \nat the center of the Milky Way, at a safe distance of 25,000 light-years. But that could change. If our galaxy collides with another, the Earth could be thrown towards \nthe galactic center, close enough \nto the supermassive black hole to be eventually swallowed up. In fact, a collision \nwith the Andromeda Galaxy is predicted to happen \n4 billion years from now, which may not be great news\nfor our home planet. But before we judge them too harshly, black holes aren’t simply agents \nof destruction. They played a crucial role \nin the formation of galaxies, the building blocks of our universe. Far from being shadowy characters \nin the cosmic play, black holes have fundamentally contributed in making the universe \na bright and astonishing place."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The gravitational field of a black hole is so strong that _______ can escape from its event horizon.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only a spacecraft with very powerful engines"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nothing, not even the light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only electrons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only the light"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The gravitational field of a black hole is so strong that _______ can escape from its event horizon.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only a spacecraft with very powerful engines"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nothing, not even the light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only electrons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only the light"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Astronomers can observe black holes because _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The volume of space inside the event horizon emits light"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Alien radio stations broadcast from there"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They observe the gravitational effects of the black holes on the space around them"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are connected with space-time tunnels to Earth"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where are black holes typically located?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stellar-mass black holes wander inside galaxies, while super-massive black holes sit at their center"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They all orbit around Earth"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Outside galaxies, in the intergalactic space"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inside galaxies, but there are none in the Milky Way"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "It is _______ that planet Earth will be destroyed by a black hole.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Impossible"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Certain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Possible, if we observe black holes too much"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Possible, but extremely unlikely"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Black holes are fundamental components of the universe because _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They contributed to the formation and evolution of galaxies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They get rid of useless stars and planets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are amusing objects for astronomers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They emit radio waves, and the music they broadcast is good"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 24, "lesson": 7, "title": "Is height all in your genes?", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/Xlt3hbpl", "transcript": {"en": "Hey smart people, Joe here. I am a descendent of giants. With a grandfather, dad, two uncles, and an\naunt all towering over 6 feet tall. We are the people you don’t want to stand\nbehind at a Bon Jovi concert, but we’re also the people who can get that thing off\nthe top shelf for you. At 6’3”, I turned out to be the short\none in the family. Now that I have a son myself, I’m wondering\nif he’s going to be tall too. Is height only written in our genes or is\nthere something else that determines how tall These days, the average American woman is\nabout five foot four, while the average Joe American male is about five foot nine. But… human height has had its ups and downs\nover the centuries. Three million years ago, our ancestor Australopithecus\nonly stood about four feet tall. One-and-a-half million years later , Homo\nerectus, the first early human to use complex tools, reached up to five foot seven. And by the Stone Age, men of the Gravettian\nhunter-gatherer culture in Europe stood at an average of 6 feet. Most of the historical data we have is for\nmale height, because… reasons. Then agriculture happened. When Europeans switched to a lower-protein,\nhigher-grain diet, men gradually lost 8 inches in height, on average. And they stayed that way for thousands of\nyears. By the time the 18th century rolled around,\nthe average European man was only five foot five inches tall. But when those Europeans emigrated to America,\ntheir kids grew up to be five foot eight inches tall on average. A huge jump in just a generation. During the Industrial Revolution heights took\na dip due to urban crowding and disease, but soon after, the human height boom continued\nand continues today. Every decade for the past couple centuries\nEuropeans have grown an average of about half an inch. Today, Dutch men are the tallest people in\nthe world, with an average height of just over 6 feet - back to where those Gravettians\nstarted 8 millennia ago. These fluctuations of height, sometimes within\na single generation, show that our environment determines a big part of how tall we are. But people in different regions, and different\nfamilies, show us that height has genetic causes too. So which has a bigger role, nature? Or nurture? In the early 19th century, scientists first\nnoticed a correlation between people’s heights and their wealth – people from poor backgrounds\ntended to be shorter than people who were more well-off. Instead of asking whether someone’s upbringing\nmight influence their height, many scholars at the time decided tallness was a physical\nmark of “superior” humans. Francis Galton - who would later become infamous\nfor popularizing eugenics - was the first scientist to conduct a large-scale, systematic\nstudy of height. He precisely measured the height of thousands\nof people as part of a sort of scientific side show. But Galton’s results were confusing. Parents’ heights often didn’t predict\nthe heights of their kids. The heights of siblings on the other hand,\nwere much closer. This inspired scientists to look at height\nin twins. Studying twins can teach us a ton about how\ngenes and environments influence human attributes. Fraternal twins can be as different genetically\nas any other pair of siblings, with the added advantage of being exactly the same age. Identical twins are genetically, well, identical. So we can see how much genetic carbon copies\nend up differing. And twins separated at birth offer a window\ninto what happens when genetically identical individuals grow up in very different environments. Turns out that twins, especially identical\ntwins, tend to be close in height - but not exactly the same. Twin studies, like history, show us genes\ncan only be part of the story when it comes to height. So how big a part? In 2007, scientists compared height and DNA\nbetween more than 11,000 pairs of siblings and found that, across humans, 86% of height’s\nvariation can be explained by genetics. As traits go, this is very high; for comparison,\ngenetics only explains about 26% of left-handedness. So we should be able to predict a person’s\nheight from his or her DNA right? Not so fast. We know genes make a huge difference, just\nnot which genes. So far, scientists have identified about 800\ngenes that influence height, but many of them only make a tiny contribution. Take HGMA2, one of the first genes linked\nto height. Having one copy of the “tall” version\nonly “lifts” a person about an eighth of an inch, so even if you inherit a copy\nfrom both of your parents, that still only gains you a quarter of an inch at most. Altogether, the 800 height genes we know of\ncan only explain 27% of how height varies between people. There’s clearly lots of genetic influence\nwe don’t understand. Maybe the effects of some genes add up in\nunexpected ways - genes may interact in combinations, where four and four makes sixteen, not eight. If we could just study the DNA of all the\n7 billion people on Earth, maybe we would find all the genes that affect height. Or maybe we’d find that scientists have\noverestimated the contribution of genetics? Because our environment, defined by health\nand diet, certainly has a hand in shaping our height. South Koreans today are more than an inch\ntaller than North Koreans, despite minimal genetic differences. Clearly, one’s diet during childhood, is\na crucial in determining adult height. That’s why humans shrank with the switch\nto agriculture and again during the Industrial Revolution. Today, most scientists agree that nature and\nnurture combine to shape our height. Some even propose calling height an “omnigenic”\ntrait - one that nearly all our genes influence in some way. For now, the only surefire way to know how\ntall you’ll end up… is just to wait and see.

That's the trouble with growing tall. Gravity's pull is keeping us all down, but there are a few earthly giants that have fought gravity and won. (gentle instrumental music) The key to growing tall is\nhow you use your energy. That's why the tallest trees\noutrank any animal on Earth, because trees spend all\ntheir energy on one thing; growing taller than\ntheir fellow neighbors. And there are two trees\nthat are the best growers of them all: giant redwoods\nand mountain ashes. Redwoods are renowned as the\ntallest lifeforms on Earth, but some experts think that\nmountain ashes could grow even taller if humans would\nstop cutting them down. In fact, the tallest mountain ash was just one meter shorter than\nthe tallest redwood. Unlike plants, animals spend\nenergy on all sorts of tasks, like eating, walking, and staying warm, so they can't grow as tall. But it doesn't mean they're small, either. If you measured this African elephant from shoulder to ground, it would actually be\ntaller than a giraffe, but thanks to their long, strong necks, giraffes are the tallest animals alive. And if we look at animals\nthroughout Earth's history, dinosaurs eclipsed them all. These towering sauropods were\nthe biggest of the bunch. In fact, the top ten lists of tallest animals in history? All dinosaurs. But what if we looked at\nthe longest lifeforms, too? If you balance the longest\nsaltwater crocodile on its nose, it would tie the giraffe. And if we ignore legs it gets even better. Tip-to-tail, the green\nanaconda nearly doubles the height of the tallest giraffe. But these land-dwellers have\nnothing on animals of the deep. Supported by water, sea life\ncan practically ignore gravity, which means they can grow much larger. Take the blue whale, for example. It's the most massive animal of all time. For example, the entire cast of Broadway's The Lion King can fit on its tongue. But it should be careful\nnot to get tangled up in the tentacles of a\nlion's mane jellyfish, which makes the giant squid\nlook small by comparison. Now, the biggest fish\nalive is the whale shark, and if we look into the\npast things get even bigger. So where do humans fit into all this? Somewhere near the top, actually. Humans are bigger than\n87.6% of mammals on Earth and the average Dutchman\nis the tallest of them all. So there's no reason to\never feel small again, especially if you're from the Netherlands.

{"page": 24, "lesson": 9, "title": "Is there any truth to the King Arthur legends? - Alan Lupack", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/is-there-any-truth-to-the-king-arthur-legends-alan-lupack", "transcript": {"en": "“Here lies Arthur, \nking who was, and king who will be.” So reads the inscription \non King Arthur’s gravestone in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur. Writing in the 15th century, Malory couldn’t have known how prophetic\nthis inscription would turn out to be. King Arthur has risen again \nand again in our collective imagination, along with his retinue of knights, Guinevere, the Round Table, Camelot, and of course, Excalibur. But where do these stories come from,\nand is there any truth to them? King Arthur as we know him \nis a creation of the later Middle Ages, but his legend actually has its roots \nin Celtic poetry from an earlier time: the Saxon invasions of Britain. After the Romans left Britain in 410 CE, Saxon invaders from \nwhat’s now Germany and Denmark quickly capitalized on the vulnerability \nof the abandoned territory. The inhabitants of Britain fought \nfiercely against the invaders through several centuries of turmoil. There are hardly any written records \nfrom this time, so it’s difficult to reconstruct \nan accurate history. However, surviving poetry from the era\ngives us some clues. One of the poems, The Gododdin, contains\nthe very first reference to Arthur, though Arthur himself \ndoesn’t actually appear in it. It says a different warrior,\nnamed Gwawrddur, was skilled at slaying his enemies, \nbut was no Arthur. That’s not much to go on, but whoever this Arthur was, he must’ve been \nthe gold standard of warriors. Whether he ruled anyone, or even lived \nat all is, unfortunately, less clear. Despite this uncertainty, references to Arthur caught \nthe attention of an aspiring historian hundreds of years later. In 1130, Geoffrey of Monmouth \nwas a lowly cleric with grand ambitions. Using Celtic and Latin sources, he spent years creating \na lengthy chronicle titled, \"The History \nof the Kings of Britain.\" The centerpiece \nof this tome was King Arthur. History is a generous term \nfor Geoffrey’s account. Writing six hundred years after \nthe Saxon invasions, he cobbled together fragments \nof myth and poetry to compensate for the almost \ncomplete lack of official records. A few of his sources contained \nmentions of Arthur, and some others were realistic accounts \nof battles and places. But many featured mythic heroes \nfighting long odds with the help of magical swords \nand sorcery. Geoffrey blended them all: A magical sword called Caledfwlch and a Roman fortress called Caerleon \nappeared in his source material, so Geoffrey’s Arthur ruled from Caerleon\nand wielded Caliburnus, the Latin translation of Caledfwlch. Geoffrey even added a wise\ncounselor named Merlin, based on the Celtic bard Myrrdin, \nto Arthur’s story. If Arthur did live, he would likely \nhave been a military leader, but a castle-bound king better fit\nGeoffrey’s regal history. Geoffrey’s chronicle got the attention \nhe’d hoped for, and was soon translated from Latin\ninto French by the poet Wace around 1155 CE. Wace added another centerpiece of\nArthurian lore to Geoffrey’s sword, castle, and wizard: the Round Table. He wrote that Arthur \nhad the table constructed so that all guests in his court \nwould be equally placed, and none could boast that he had \nthe highest position at the table. After reading Wace’s translation, \nanother French poet, Chrétien de Troyes, wrote a series of romances \nthat catapulted Arthur’s story to fame. He introduced tales of individual knights \nlike Lancelot and Gawain, and mixed elements of romance \nin with the adventures. He conceived Arthur, Lancelot, and Guinevere’s love triangle. In addition to interpersonal intrigue,\nhe also introduced the Holy Grail. Chrétien probably based his Grail’s powers\non magical objects in Celtic mythology. He lived in the middle of the Crusades, and others imposed the preoccupations \nof the time on the Grail, casting it as a powerful relic \nfrom the crucifixion. Numerous adaptations in French \nand other languages followed from Chrétien’s work. In the course of these retellings,\nCaerleon became Camelot, and Caliburnus \nwas rechristened Excalibur. In the 15th century, Sir Thomas Malory synthesized \nthese stories in Le Morte D’arthur, the basis of many modern accounts \nof King Arthur.

{"page": 24, "lesson": 10, "title": "Why danger symbols can’t last forever", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/t9BUI9tq", "transcript": {"en": "You probably know how this symbol is supposed\nto make you feel. And this one. This one too, even if you’re not sure exactly\nwhat it means. But what about this? This symbol — The Jolly Roger — was once\none of the most feared symbols in the world. It represented death, pirates, and poison. But today, it’s associated more with treasure, blockbuster\nmovies, or Halloween than actual danger. We are surrounded by icons that warn us: what\nto stay away from, what not to do, what to be afraid of. But how do you design a symbol in a way that\nwill last across generations and languages? It turns out that is an incredibly hard thing\nto do. Back in the early 20th century, there was\nan urgent need for a new kind of warning symbol. At the time, there was no universal standard\nfor communicating the presence of dangerous biological materials. Laboratories at the US Army used an inverted\nblue triangle. Those at the Navy used a pink rectangle. The Universal Postal Convention used a white\nstaff-and-snake on a violet background. There was no consistency in the visual language\nused to communicate risk. That was dangerous, and could lead to accidental\ninfections. So in 1966, a group of engineers and designers\nat Dow Chemical set out to create the best possible icon for biohazardous materials. They laid out six design criteria. First, it needed to be visually striking,\nso that it would draw immediate attention. That ruled out simple shapes like those from\nthe Navy and Army. It also had to be unique and unambiguous,\nin order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes. That ruled out the snake-and-staff, which\nhas multiple versions and has a pretty vague meaning as a general symbol for medicine. On top of that, it had to be quickly recognizable\nand easily recalled. Had to be easy to stencil. And rotationally symmetrical, in order to\nappear identical from all angles. And lastly, it had to be acceptable to groups\nof all backgrounds. So the Dow Chemical team designed an experiment. Charles Baldwin, an environmental health engineer\nbehind the experiment, said that the team “wanted something that was memorable but\nmeaningless … so we could educate people as to what it means.\" They showed a set of 24 symbols to 300 people\nfrom 25 American cities. There were 6 newly-designed biohazard markers,\nand 18 common symbols — things like Mr. Peanut, the Texaco star, the Shell Oil symbol,\nthe Red Cross, and a swastika. Participants were asked to guess the meaning\nof each one, which was used to assign each one a “meaningfulness score.” A week later, the same participants were shown\nthose original 24 symbols, plus 36 more. They were asked to identify which symbols\nthey remembered seeing in the previous round of the study. Among the six competing biohazard designs,\nthis one stood out. It scored the highest in memorability, but\nthe lowest in meaningfulness. So it was unforgettable, but also a totally\nblank slate for designers who wanted to give it meaning. And with that, it became a national standard. It’s easy to overlook how much visual communication\nwork these symbols are doing. They’re simple — you only need a straightedge\nand a compass to recreate them. And unlike most other hazard symbols, they\ndon’t reference an existing physical object or idea. But they’ve remained iconic for decades,\nhelping people recognize serious dangers that may remain a threat for thousands of years\nto come. And that raises the question: could the meaning\nof those symbols stand the test of time? Few people have pondered that question quite\nlike Gregory Benford. He’s a physicist and science fiction author. In the 1990s, he was invited to work on the\nWaste Isolation Pilot Project, or WIPP. The WIPP is a massive storage site for radioactive\nwaste in the southeastern plains of New Mexico, organized by the US Department of Energy. Benford was brought in to help calculate the\nprobability that someone or something would intrude on the site for as long as it remains\ndangerous — approximately the next 10,000 years. “Well, name anything that has persisted\nfor 10,000 years. Any institution. There isn't any. The record is probably something like the\nCatholic Church or the core of the Jewish religion, which tells us something about what\nreally lasts.” The meaning of a symbol can change over time. Like the Jolly Roger, which wouldn't work\nfor the radioactive threat at the WIPP. \"If you're approaching the WIPP facility and\nyou see a skull and crossbones you might think, ‘Hey this is where the pirates buried their\ntreasure.’” So how do you indicate a long lasting danger\nacross any language? Since the 1970s, engineers, anthropologists,\nphysicists, and behavioral scientists have proposed different solutions to that problem. One strategy was to add context to the symbol. By illustrating cause and effect in a three-part\ncartoon like this, designers could communicate the idea even if the symbol lost its meaning. But this kind of visual communication still\nmade a lot of assumptions about the user: that they would read left to right, that they\nwould understand causality between frames — and, of course, that the drawing itself\nwould last millennia of wear and tear. So other designers started to focus on creating\na warning without inscribed communication, by altering the shape of the location itself. And that yielded designs like this. Spike fields, forbidding blocks, giant pyramids:\nthese designs capitalized on natural instincts of fear and discomfort to keep people away. But even then, they weren’t foolproof. Designers couldn’t be sure whether they\nwould be perceived as terrifying or fascinating. “Conflict between these two urges: you want\npeople to notice it but you don't want people to go there. Those are always going to fight each other.” So without symbols, without basic illustrations,\nor physical structures, how can you effectively communicate a warning? That’s where the more philosophical design\nsolutions come in. In 1984, the German Journal of Semiotics published\na series of solutions from various scholars. Linguist Thomas Sebeok proposed creating an\natomic priesthood, where an exclusive political group would use its own rituals and myths\nto preserve information about the radioactive areas. And philosophers François Bastide and Paolo\nFabbri proposed to genetically engineer bioluminescent cats that would glow in the presence of radioactivity. By creating songs and traditions about the\ndanger of glowing cats, the warning could last as long as the oldest relics of civilization\nwe have: culture. There’s no definitive solution for warning\npeople far into the future. But designing clear, inclusive symbols will\ncontinue to be a fundamental part of how we keep people safe. We will change, and so will the ways we communicate\nvisually. Our warning symbols will have to change along\nwith us."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following was NOT one of the design criteria laid out by Dow Chemical to create the biohazard icon?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Visually striking"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Unique & unambiguous"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Easy to stencil"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Monochromatic"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is unique about the biohazard symbol compared to other hazard signs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Doesn’t reference an existing physical object"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Easy to replicate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only need a compass to recreate"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

To get past Imperial customs, all\npackages must follow a strict protocol: if a box is marked with \nan even number on the bottom, it must be sealed with a red top. The boxes are already being loaded \nonto the transport when you receive an urgent message. One of the four boxes \nwas sealed incorrectly, but they lost track of which one. All the boxes are still \non the conveyor belt. Two are facing down: \none marked with a four, and one with a seven. The other two are facing up: one with a black top, another with a red one. You know that any violation \nof the protocol will get the entire shipment confiscated\nand put your allies in grave danger. But any boxes you pull off for inspection\nwon’t make it onto this delivery run, depriving the rebels \nof critically needed supplies. The transport leaves in a few moments,\nwith or without its cargo. Which box or boxes should you \ngrab off the conveyor belt? Pause the video now if you want\nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 It may seem like you need to inspect \nall four boxes to see what’s on the other side of each. But in fact, only two of them matter. Let’s look at the protocol again. All it says is that even-numbered boxes \nmust have a red top. It doesn’t say anything \nabout odd-numbered boxes, so we can just ignore \nthe box marked with a seven. What about the box with a red top? Don’t we need to check \nthat the number on the bottom is even? As it turns out, we don’t. The protocol says that \nif a box has an even number, then it should have a red top. It doesn’t say that only boxes \nwith even numbers can have red tops, or that a box with a red top \nmust have an even number. The requirement \nonly goes in one direction. So we don’t need \nto check the box with the red lid. We do, however, \nneed to check the one with the black lid, to make sure it wasn’t incorrectly \nplaced on an even-numbered box. If you initially assumed the rules \nimply a symmetrical match between the number on the box \nand the type of lid, you’re not alone. That error is so common,\nwe even have a name for it: affirming the consequent, or the fallacy of the converse. This fallacy wrongly assumes that just because a certain condition \nis necessary for a given result, it must also be sufficient for it. For instance, having an atmosphere \nis a necessary condition for being a habitable planet. But this doesn’t mean that \nit’s a sufficient condition – planets like Venus have atmospheres \nbut lack other criteria for habitability. If that still seems hard \nto wrap your head around, let’s look at \na slightly different problem. Imagine the boxes contain groceries. You see one marked for shipment \nto a steakhouse and one to a vegetarian restaurant. Then you see two more boxes \nturned upside down: one labeled as containing meat, and another as containing onions. Which ones do you need to check? Well, it’s easy – make sure the meat isn’t being shipped \nto the vegetarian restaurant, and that the box going there \ndoesn’t contain meat. The onions can go to either place, and the box bound for the steakhouse \ncan contain either product. Why does this scenario seem easier? Formally, it’s the same problem – two possible conditions\nfor the top of the box, and two for the bottom. But in this case, they’re based on \nfamiliar real-world needs, and we easily understand that \nwhile vegetarians only eat vegetables, they’re not the only ones who do so. In the original problem,\nthe rules seemed more arbitrary, and when they’re abstracted that way, the logical connections \nbecome harder to see. In your case, you’ve managed \nto get enough supplies through to enable the resistance \nto fight another day. And you did it by thinking \noutside the box – both sides of it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the Imperial customs protocol?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Odd-numbered boxes must have a black top"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Even-numbered boxes must have a red top"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Odd-numbered boxes must have a black top and even-numbered boxes must have a red top"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many even-numbered boxes are there?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "At least one"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No more than two"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Exactly three"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why shouldn’t you just inspect all the boxes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "You don’t have enough time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Any boxes you inspect won’t make it into the shipment"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Some boxes are rigged with explosives"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What happens if an improperly marked box goes through?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It will explode"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The rebels will be poisoned"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The entire shipment will be confiscated"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which logical fallacy is common in this problem?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Affirming the consequent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Affirming the disjunct"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Conjunction fallacy"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But what is it expanding into? That's a complicated question. Here's why: Einstein's equations of\ngeneral relativity describe space and time\nas a kind of inter-connected fabric for the universe. This means that what we know of\nas space and time exist only as part of the universe\nand not beyond it. Now, when everyday objects\nexpand, they move out into more space. But if there is no such thing\nas space to expand into, what does expanding \neven mean? In 1929 Edwin Hubble's \nastronomy observations gave us a definitive answer. His survey of the night sky\nfound all faraway galaxies recede, or move away,\nfrom the Earth. Moreover, the further the galaxy, \nthe faster it recedes. How can we interpret this? Consider a loaf of raisin bread\nrising in the oven. The batter rises by the same\namount in between each and every raisin. If we think of raisins as a \nstand-in for galaxies, and batter as the space\nbetween them, we can imagine that the\nstretching or expansion of intergalactic space will make \nthe galaxies recede from each other, and for any galaxy, its faraway\nneighbors will recede a larger distance than the nearby ones in the same amount of time. Sure enough, the equations of\ngeneral relativity predict a cosmic tug-of-war between gravity \nand expansion. It's only in the dark void between\ngalaxies where expansion wins out, and space stretches. So there's our answer. The universe is expanding \nunto itself. That said, cosmologists are pushing \nthe limits of mathematical models to speculate on what, if anything,\nexists beyond our spacetime. These aren't wild guesses,\nbut hypotheses that tackle kinks in the scientific theory\nof the Big Bang. The Big Bang predicts matter to be \ndistributed evenly across the universe, as a sparse gas --but then, how \ndid galaxies and stars come to be? The inflationary model \ndescribes a brief era of incredibly rapid expansion that relates quantum fluctuations \nin the energy of the early universe, to the formation of clumps of gas \nthat eventually led to galaxies. If we accept this paradigm, it may \nalso imply our universe represents one region in a greater cosmic reality \nthat undergoes endless, eternal inflation. We know nothing of this \nspeculative inflating reality, save for the mathematical prediction \nthat its endless expansion may be driven by an unstable \nquantum energy state. In many local regions, however, \nthe energy may settle by random chance into a stable state, stopping \ninflation and forming bubble universes. Each bubble universe\n—ours being one of them —would be described by its own \nBig Bang and laws of physics. Our universe would be part \nof a greater multiverse, in which the fantastic rate of eternal \ninflation makes it impossible for us to encounter a neighbor universe. The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, \nhot universe, our fundamental forces may unify into one super-force. Mathematical string theories suggest \ndescriptions of this unification, in addition to a fundamental structure \nfor sub-atomic quarks and electrons. In these proposed models, vibrating strings \nare the building blocks of the universe. Competing models for strings have now \nbeen consolidated into a unified description, and suggest these structures may interact \nwith massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes. Our universe may be contained \nwithin one such brane, floating in an unknown higher dimensional \nplace, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace. Other branes—containing other types of \nuniverses—may co-exist in hyperspace, and neighboring branes may even share \ncertain fundamental forces like gravity. Both eternal inflation and branes \ndescribe a multiverse, but while universes in eternal inflation are \nisolated, brane universes could bump into each other. An echo of such a collision may appear \nin the cosmic microwave background —a soup of radiation throughout our universe, \nthat’s a relic from an early Big Bang era. So far, though, we’ve found \nno such cosmic echo. Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses \nmay eventually coalesce into a common description, or be replaced by something else. As it stands now, they’re speculative \nexplorations of mathematical models. While these models are inspired and \nguided by many scientific experiments, there are very few objective experiments \nto directly test them, yet. Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along, scientists will likely be left to argue about \nthe elegance of their competing models… and continue to dream about what, \nif anything, lies beyond our universe."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When astronomer Edwin Hubble completed his survey of the night sky, what strange discovery did he make?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In the northern hemisphere, all distant galaxies are receding."}, {"label": "B", "text": "All distant stars are moving towards the Earth."}, {"label": "C", "text": "All distant galaxies are receding from the Earth."}, {"label": "D", "text": "All distant galaxies are moving towards the Earth."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What do Hubble’s observations tell us about the universe?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, over time."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The universe is expanding unto itself."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Cosmic Microwave Background is a relic from the early universe."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The universe is cooling, over time."}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is predicted by eternal inflation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The universe is part of a greater multiverse in which there are parallel universes identical to our own."}, {"label": "B", "text": "The universe is part of a greater multiverse in which bubble universes inflate over time."}, {"label": "C", "text": "The universe is part of a greater multiverse in which bubble universes randomly form and merge."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The universe is part of a greater multiverse in which bubble universes are isolated by a rapidly inflating reality."}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is predicted by brane cosmology?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brane universes may interact with one another by sharing certain fundamental forces, such as gravity."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Brane universes may interact with one another by means of cosmic strings."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Brane universes are part of a greater hyperspace in which branes randomly form and merge."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brane universes are formed within the subatomic realm of particle physics."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "If a so-called “echo” interference effect is observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background, this would strongly support which speculative theory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Big Bang"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cosmic inflation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eternal inflation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Brane cosmology"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

One thing that stuck out to me\nwas: don't just talk about impact, but make an impact. I'm a little bit older than you, maybe much older than you, but this is exactly the same goal\nthat I had when I was in college. I wanted to make my own impact\nfor those who live under injustice; it's the reason that I became\na documentary journalist, the reason I became a prisoner in North Korea for 140 days. It was March 17, 2009. It is St. Patrick's Day for all of you, but it was the day\nthat turned my life upside down. My team and I were making a documentary\nabout North Korean refugees living below human life in China. We were at the border. It was our last day of filming. There was no wire fence or bars or sign to show that it is the border, but this is a place that a lot\nof North Korean defectors use as an escape route. It was still winter, and the river was frozen. When we were in the middle\nof the frozen river, we were filming about\nthe condition of the cold weather and the environment that North Koreans had to deal with when they seek their freedom. And suddenly, one\nof my team members shouted, \"Soldiers!\" So I looked back, and there were two small soldiers\nin green uniforms with rifles, chasing after us. We all ran as fast as we could. I prayed that, please\ndon't let them shoot my head. And I was thinking that, if my feet are on Chinese soil, I'll be safe. And I made it to Chinese soil. Then I saw my colleague\nLaura Ling fall on her knees. I didn't know what to do\nat that short moment, but I knew that I could not\nleave her alone there when she said,\n\"Euna, I can't feel my legs.\" In a flash, we were surrounded\nby these two Korean soldiers. They were not much bigger than us, but they were determined\nto take us to their army base. I begged and yelled for any kind of help, hoping that someone\nwould show up from China. Here I was, being stubborn towards a trained soldier with a gun. I looked at his eyes. He was just a boy. At that moment,\nhe raised his rifle to hit me, but I saw that he was hesitating. His eyes were shaking, and his rifle was still up in the air. So I shouted at him, \"OK, OK, I'll walk with you.\" And I got up. When we arrived at their army base, my head was spinning\nwith these worst-case scenarios, and my colleague's\nstatement wasn't helping. She said, \"We are the enemy.\" She was right: we were the enemy. And I was supposed to be frightened, too. But I kept having these odd experiences. This time, an officer brought me his coat to keep me warm, because I lost my coat on the frozen river while battling with one of these soldiers. I will tell you what I mean\nby these odd experiences. I grew up in South Korea. To us, North Korea was always the enemy, even before I was born. South and North have been\nunder armistice for 63 years, since the end of the Korean War. And growing up in the South\nin the '80s and '90s, we were taught propaganda\nabout North Korea. And we heard so many graphic stories, such as, a little young boy\nbeing brutally killed by North Korean spies\njust because he said, \"I don't like communists.\" Or, I watched this cartoon series about a young South Korean boy\ndefeating these fat, big, red pig, which represented the North Koreans'\nfirst leader at the time. And the effect of hearing\nthese horrible stories over and over instilled one word in a young mind: \"enemy.\" And I think at some point,\nI dehumanized them, and the people of North Korea\nbecame equated with the North Korean government. Now, back to my detention. It was the second day of being in a cell. I had not slept\nsince I was out at the border. This young guard came to my cell and offered me this small boiled egg and said, \"This will give you\nstrength to keep going.\" Do you know what it is like, receiving a small kindness\nin the enemy's hand? Whenever they were kind to me,\nI thought the worst case was waiting for me after the kindness. One officer noticed my nervousness. He said, \"Did you think\nwe were all these red pigs?\" referring to the cartoon\nthat I just showed you. Every day was like a psychological battle. The interrogator had me sit at a table six days a week and had me writing down\nabout my journey, my work, over and over until I wrote down\nthe confession that they wanted to hear. After about three months of detention, the North Korean court sentenced me to 12 years in a labor camp. So I was just sitting in my room\nto be transferred. At that time, I really had\nnothing else to do, so I paid attention\nto these two female guards and listened to what\nthey were talking about. Guard A was older, and she studied English. She seemed like she came\nfrom an affluent family. She often showed up\nwith these colorful dresses, and then loved to show off. And Guard B was the younger one, and she was a really good singer. She loved to sing Celine Dion's\n\"My Heart Will Go On\" -- sometimes too much. She knew just how\nto torture me without knowing. (Laughter) And this girl spent a lot of time\nin the morning to put on makeup, like you can see in any young girl's life. And they loved to watch\nthis Chinese drama, a better quality production. I remember Guard B said, \"I can no longer watch our TV shows\nafter watching this.\" She got scolded for degrading her own country's\nproduced TV shows. Guard B had more\nof a free mind than Guard A, and she often got scolded by Guard A\nwhenever she expressed herself. One day, they invited\nall these female colleagues -- I don't know where they came from -- to where I was held, and they invited me to their guard room and asked if one-night stands\nreally happen in the US. (Laughter) This is the country where\nyoung couples are not even allowed to hold hands in public. I had no idea where they\nhad gotten this information, but they were shy and giggly\neven before I said anything. I think we all forgot\nthat I was their prisoner, and it was like going back\nto my high school classroom again. And I learned that these girls also\ngrew up watching a similar cartoon, but just propaganda towards\nSouth Korea and the US. I started to understand where\nthese people's anger was coming from. If these girls grew up\nlearning that we are enemies, it was just natural\nthat they would hate us just as I feared them. But at that moment, we were all just girls who shared the same interests, beyond our ideologies that separated us. I shared these stories with my boss\nat Current TV at the time after I came home. His first reaction was, \"Euna, have you heard\nof Stockholm Syndrome?\" Yes, and I clearly remember the feeling of fear and being threatened, and tension rising up\nbetween me and the interrogator when we talked about politics. There definitely was a wall\nthat we couldn't climb over. But we were able to see\neach other as human beings when we talked about family, everyday life, the importance of the future\nfor our children. It was about a month before I came home. I got really sick. Guard B stopped by my room to say goodbye, because she was leaving\nthe detention center. She made sure that no one watched us, no one heard us, and quietly said, \"I hope you get better and go back to your family soon.\" It is these people -- the officer who brought me his coat, the guard who offered me a boiled egg, these female guards who asked me\nabout dating life in the US -- they are the ones\nthat I remember of North Korea: humans just like us. North Koreans and I were not\nambassadors of our countries, but I believe that we were representing the human race. Now I'm back home and back to my life. The memory of these people\nhas blurred as time has passed. And I'm in this place where I read and hear\nabout North Korea provoking the US. I realized how easy it is to see them as an enemy again. But I have to keep reminding myself\nthat when I was over there, I was able to see humanity over hatred in my enemy's eyes. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

(Laughter) I hope that's happening. So because of this ability,\nwe humans are able to transmit our ideas across vast reaches of space and time. We're able to transmit\nknowledge across minds. I can put a bizarre new idea\nin your mind right now. I could say, \"Imagine a jellyfish waltzing in a library while thinking about quantum mechanics.\" (Laughter) Now, if everything has gone\nrelatively well in your life so far, you probably haven't had\nthat thought before. (Laughter) But now I've just made you think it, through language. Now of course, there isn't just\none language in the world, there are about 7,000 languages\nspoken around the world. And all the languages differ\nfrom one another in all kinds of ways. Some languages have different sounds, they have different vocabularies, and they also have different structures -- very importantly, different structures. That begs the question: Does the language we speak\nshape the way we think? Now, this is an ancient question. People have been speculating\nabout this question forever. Charlemagne, Holy Roman emperor, said, \"To have a second language\nis to have a second soul\" -- strong statement\nthat language crafts reality. But on the other hand,\nShakespeare has Juliet say, \"What's in a name? A rose by any other name\nwould smell as sweet.\" Well, that suggests that maybe\nlanguage doesn't craft reality. These arguments have gone\nback and forth for thousands of years. But until recently,\nthere hasn't been any data to help us decide either way. Recently, in my lab\nand other labs around the world, we've started doing research, and now we have actual scientific data\nto weigh in on this question. So let me tell you about\nsome of my favorite examples. I'll start with an example\nfrom an Aboriginal community in Australia that I had the chance to work with. These are the Kuuk Thaayorre people. They live in Pormpuraaw\nat the very west edge of Cape York. What's cool about Kuuk Thaayorre is, in Kuuk Thaayorre, they don't use\nwords like \"left\" and \"right,\" and instead, everything\nis in cardinal directions: north, south, east and west. And when I say everything,\nI really mean everything. You would say something like, \"Oh, there's an ant\non your southwest leg.\" Or, \"Move your cup\nto the north-northeast a little bit.\" In fact, the way that you say \"hello\"\nin Kuuk Thaayorre is you say, \"Which way are you going?\" And the answer should be, \"North-northeast in the far distance. How about you?\" So imagine as you're walking\naround your day, every person you greet, you have to report your heading direction. (Laughter) But that would actually get you\noriented pretty fast, right? Because you literally\ncouldn't get past \"hello,\" if you didn't know\nwhich way you were going. In fact, people who speak languages\nlike this stay oriented really well. They stay oriented better\nthan we used to think humans could. We used to think that humans\nwere worse than other creatures because of some biological excuse: \"Oh, we don't have magnets\nin our beaks or in our scales.\" No; if your language and your culture\ntrains you to do it, actually, you can do it. There are humans around the world\nwho stay oriented really well. And just to get us in agreement about how different this is\nfrom the way we do it, I want you all to close\nyour eyes for a second and point southeast. (Laughter) Keep your eyes closed. Point. OK, so you can open your eyes. I see you guys pointing there,\nthere, there, there, there ... I don't know which way it is myself -- (Laughter) You have not been a lot of help. (Laughter) So let's just say the accuracy\nin this room was not very high. This is a big difference in cognitive\nability across languages, right? Where one group -- very\ndistinguished group like you guys -- doesn't know which way is which, but in another group, I could ask a five-year-old\nand they would know. (Laughter) There are also really big differences\nin how people think about time. So here I have pictures\nof my grandfather at different ages. And if I ask an English speaker\nto organize time, they might lay it out this way, from left to right. This has to do with writing direction. If you were a speaker of Hebrew or Arabic, you might do it going\nin the opposite direction, from right to left. But how would the Kuuk Thaayorre, this Aboriginal group I just\ntold you about, do it? They don't use words\nlike \"left\" and \"right.\" Let me give you hint. When we sat people facing south, they organized time from left to right. When we sat them facing north, they organized time from right to left. When we sat them facing east, time came towards the body. What's the pattern? East to west, right? So for them, time doesn't actually\nget locked on the body at all, it gets locked on the landscape. So for me, if I'm facing this way, then time goes this way, and if I'm facing this way,\nthen time goes this way. I'm facing this way, time goes this way -- very egocentric of me to have\nthe direction of time chase me around every time I turn my body. For the Kuuk Thaayorre,\ntime is locked on the landscape. It's a dramatically different way\nof thinking about time. Here's another really smart human trick. Suppose I ask you\nhow many penguins are there. Well, I bet I know how you'd solve\nthat problem if you solved it. You went, \"One, two, three,\nfour, five, six, seven, eight.\" You counted them. You named each one with a number, and the last number you said\nwas the number of penguins. This is a little trick\nthat you're taught to use as kids. You learn the number list\nand you learn how to apply it. A little linguistic trick. Well, some languages don't do this, because some languages\ndon't have exact number words. They're languages that don't have\na word like \"seven\" or a word like \"eight.\" In fact, people who speak\nthese languages don't count, and they have trouble\nkeeping track of exact quantities. So, for example, if I ask you\nto match this number of penguins to the same number of ducks, you would be able to do that by counting. But folks who don't have\nthat linguistic trick can't do that. Languages also differ in how\nthey divide up the color spectrum -- the visual world. Some languages have\nlots of words for colors, some have only a couple words,\n\"light\" and \"dark.\" And languages differ in where they put\nboundaries between colors. So, for example, in English,\nthere's a word for blue that covers all of the colors\nthat you can see on the screen, but in Russian, there isn't a single word. Instead, Russian speakers\nhave to differentiate between light blue, \"goluboy,\" and dark blue, \"siniy.\" So Russians have this lifetime\nof experience of, in language, distinguishing these two colors. When we test people's ability\nto perceptually discriminate these colors, what we find is that\nRussian speakers are faster across this linguistic boundary. They're faster to be able\nto tell the difference between a light and dark blue. And when you look at people's brains\nas they're looking at colors -- say you have colors shifting slowly\nfrom light to dark blue -- the brains of people who use\ndifferent words for light and dark blue will give a surprised reaction\nas the colors shift from light to dark, as if, \"Ooh, something\nhas categorically changed,\" whereas the brains\nof English speakers, for example, that don't make\nthis categorical distinction, don't give that surprise, because nothing is categorically changing. Languages have all kinds\nof structural quirks. This is one of my favorites. Lots of languages have grammatical gender; every noun gets assigned a gender,\noften masculine or feminine. And these genders differ across languages. So, for example, the sun is feminine\nin German but masculine in Spanish, and the moon, the reverse. Could this actually have any\nconsequence for how people think? Do German speakers think of the sun\nas somehow more female-like, and the moon somehow more male-like? Actually, it turns out that's the case. So if you ask German and Spanish speakers\nto, say, describe a bridge, like the one here -- \"bridge\" happens to be grammatically\nfeminine in German, grammatically masculine in Spanish -- German speakers are more likely\nto say bridges are \"beautiful,\" \"elegant\" and stereotypically feminine words. Whereas Spanish speakers\nwill be more likely to say they're \"strong\" or \"long,\" these masculine words. (Laughter) Languages also differ in how\nthey describe events, right? You take an event like this, an accident. In English, it's fine to say,\n\"He broke the vase.\" In a language like Spanish, you might be more likely\nto say, \"The vase broke,\" or, \"The vase broke itself.\" If it's an accident, you wouldn't say\nthat someone did it. In English, quite weirdly,\nwe can even say things like, \"I broke my arm.\" Now, in lots of languages, you couldn't use that construction\nunless you are a lunatic and you went out\nlooking to break your arm -- (Laughter) and you succeeded. If it was an accident,\nyou would use a different construction. Now, this has consequences. So, people who speak different languages\nwill pay attention to different things, depending on what their language\nusually requires them to do. So we show the same accident\nto English speakers and Spanish speakers, English speakers will remember who did it, because English requires you\nto say, \"He did it; he broke the vase.\" Whereas Spanish speakers might be\nless likely to remember who did it if it's an accident, but they're more likely to remember\nthat it was an accident. They're more likely\nto remember the intention. So, two people watch the same event, witness the same crime, but end up remembering\ndifferent things about that event. This has implications, of course,\nfor eyewitness testimony. It also has implications\nfor blame and punishment. So if you take English speakers and I just show you\nsomeone breaking a vase, and I say, \"He broke the vase,\"\nas opposed to \"The vase broke,\" even though you can witness it yourself, you can watch the video, you can watch the crime against the vase, you will punish someone more, you will blame someone more\nif I just said, \"He broke it,\" as opposed to, \"It broke.\" The language guides\nour reasoning about events. Now, I've given you a few examples of how language can profoundly\nshape the way we think, and it does so in a variety of ways. So language can have big effects, like we saw with space and time, where people can lay out space and time in completely different\ncoordinate frames from each other. Language can also have\nreally deep effects -- that's what we saw\nwith the case of number. Having count words in your language, having number words, opens up the whole world of mathematics. Of course, if you don't count,\nyou can't do algebra, you can't do any of the things that would be required\nto build a room like this or make this broadcast, right? This little trick of number words\ngives you a stepping stone into a whole cognitive realm. Language can also have\nreally early effects, what we saw in the case of color. These are really simple,\nbasic, perceptual decisions. We make thousands of them all the time, and yet, language is getting in there and fussing even with these tiny little\nperceptual decisions that we make. Language can have really broad effects. So the case of grammatical gender\nmay be a little silly, but at the same time,\ngrammatical gender applies to all nouns. That means language can shape\nhow you're thinking about anything that can be\nnamed by a noun. That's a lot of stuff. And finally, I gave you an example\nof how language can shape things that have personal weight to us -- ideas like blame and punishment\nor eyewitness memory. These are important things\nin our daily lives. Now, the beauty of linguistic diversity\nis that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible\nthe human mind is. Human minds have invented\nnot one cognitive universe, but 7,000 -- there are 7,000 languages\nspoken around the world. And we can create many more -- languages, of course, are living things, things that we can hone\nand change to suit our needs. The tragic thing is that we're losing\nso much of this linguistic diversity all the time. We're losing about one language a week, and by some estimates, half of the world's languages\nwill be gone in the next hundred years. And the even worse news is that right now, almost everything we know about\nthe human mind and human brain is based on studies of usually American\nEnglish-speaking undergraduates at universities. That excludes almost all humans. Right? So what we know about the human mind\nis actually incredibly narrow and biased, and our science has to do better. I want to leave you\nwith this final thought. I've told you about how speakers\nof different languages think differently, but of course, that's not about\nhow people elsewhere think. It's about how you think. It's how the language that you speak\nshapes the way that you think. And that gives you the opportunity to ask, \"Why do I think the way that I do?\" \"How could I think differently?\" And also, \"What thoughts do I wish to create?\" Thank you very much.

On the big day, you wait nervously\nas your teacher hands it out. You’re working your way through, \nwhen you’re asked to define ‘ataraxia.’ You know you’ve seen it before, \nbut your mind goes blank. What just happened? The answer lies in \nthe complex relationship between stress and memory. There are many types \nand degrees of stress and different kinds of memory, but we’re going to focus on \nhow short-term stress impacts your memory for facts. To start, it helps to understand \nhow this kind of memory works. Facts you read, hear, or study become memories through\na process with three main steps. First comes acquisition: the moment you encounter\na new piece of information. Each sensory experience activates \na unique set of brain areas. In order to become lasting memories, these sensory experiences have to be consolidated \nby the hippocampus, influenced by the amygdala, which emphasizes experiences \nassociated with strong emotions. The hippocampus then encodes memories, probably by strengthening \nthe synaptic connections stimulated during \nthe original sensory experience. Once a memory has been encoded, it can be remembered, \nor retrieved, later. Memories are stored all over the brain, and it’s likely the prefrontal cortex \nthat signals for their retrieval. So how does stress \naffect each of these stages? In the first two stages, moderate stress can actually \nhelp experiences enter your memory. Your brain responds to stressful stimuli by releasing hormones \nknown as corticosteroids, which activate a process \nof threat-detection and threat-response in the amygdala. The amygdala prompts your hippocampus to consolidate the stress-inducing \nexperience into a memory. Meanwhile, the flood \nof corticosteroids from stress stimulates your hippocampus, also prompting memory consolidation. But even though some stress \ncan be helpful, extreme and chronic stress \ncan have the opposite effect. Researchers have tested this by injecting\nrats directly with stress hormones. As they gradually increased \nthe dose of corticosteroids, the rats’ performance on\nmemory tests increased at first, but dropped off at higher doses. In humans, we see a similar \npositive effect with moderate stress. But that only appears when \nthe stress is related to the memory task— so while time pressure might \nhelp you memorize a list, having a friend scare you will not. And the weeks, months, or even years of sustained corticosteroids \nthat result from chronic stress can damage the hippocampus and decrease your ability \nto form new memories. It would be nice if some stress \nalso helped us remember facts, but unfortunately, the opposite is true. The act of remembering relies \non the prefrontal cortex, which governs thought, \nattention, and reasoning. When corticosteroids \nstimulate the amygdala, the amygdala inhibits, \nor lessens the activity of, the prefrontal cortex. The reason for this inhibition\nis so the fight/flight/freeze response can overrule slower, more reasoned \nthought in a dangerous situation. But that can also have \nthe unfortunate effect of making your mind \ngo blank during a test. And then the act of trying to remember\ncan itself be a stressor, leading to a vicious cycle \nof more corticosteroid release and an even smaller chance of remembering. So what can you do to turn stress \nto your advantage and stay calm and collected \nwhen it matters the most? First, if you know a stressful\nsituation like a test is coming, try preparing in conditions similar \nto the stressful environment. Novelty can be a stressor. Completing practice questions \nunder time pressure, or seated at a desk \nrather than on a couch, can make your stress response\nto these circumstances less sensitive during the test itself. Exercise is another useful tool. Increasing your heart \nand breathing rate is linked to chemical changes \nin your brain that help reduce anxiety \nand increase your sense of well-being. Regular exercise is also widely \nthought to improve sleeping patterns, which comes in handy \nthe night before a test. And on the actual test day, try taking deep breaths to counteract \nyour body’s flight/fight/freeze response. Deep breathing exercises have shown\nmeasurable reduction in test anxiety in groups ranging from\nthird graders to nursing students. So the next time you find your mind \ngoing blank at a critical moment, take a few deep breaths \nuntil you remember ataraxia: a state of calmness, free from anxiety."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What do corticosteroids do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Call on your hippocampus to recall a fact or memory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Activate a process of threat-detection and threat-response in the amygdala"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Release into your body and calm your nerves before a test"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Make you sweat in stressful situations"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What shouldn’t you do to help stay calm and collected when it matters most?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Prepare in conditions similar to the stressful environment"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Exercise regularly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Practice deep breathing exercises"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Prepare in comfortable positions like on a couch or bed to put your mind at ease"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What part of the brain is not a key player in our memory for facts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brainstem"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Amygdala"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pre-frontal cortex"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hippocampus"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which is not one of the three main steps to process of memorizing facts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Acquisition"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Retrieval"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Consolidation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Remembrance"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What does ataraxia mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A state of calmness, free from anxiety"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A state of trepidation or fear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A state of discontent"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A state of jubilation"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 24, "lesson": 16, "title": "Why should you read \"One Hundred Years of Solitude\"? - Francisco Díez-Buzo", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-one-hundred-years-of-solitude-francisco-diez-buzo", "transcript": {"en": "One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco\nfor a vacation with his family, Colombian journalist Gabriel García \nMárquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take care of the\nfamily’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a new book \nhad suddenly come to him: “Many years later, \nas he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember \nthat distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Over the next eighteen months, those words would blossom \ninto One Hundred Years of Solitude. A novel that would go on \nto bring Latin American literature to the forefront \nof the global imagination, earning García Márquez \nthe 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude \nso remarkable? The novel chronicles the fortunes\nand misfortunes of the Buendía family \nover seven generations. With its lush, detailed sentences, large cast of characters, and tangled narrative, One Hundred Years of Solitude \nis not an easy book to read. But it’s a deeply rewarding one, with an epic assortment \nof intense romances, civil war, political intrigue, globe-trotting adventurers, and more characters \nnamed Aureliano than you’d think possible. Yet this is no mere historical drama. One Hundred Years of Solitude \nis one of the most famous examples of a literary genre \nknown as magical realism. Here, supernatural events or abilities are described in a realistic \nand matter-of-fact tone, while the real events of human life \nand history reveal themselves \nto be full of fantastical absurdity. Surreal phenomena within the\nfictional village of Macondo intertwine seamlessly with events taking\nplace in the real country of Colombia. The settlement begins \nin a mythical state of isolation, but is gradually exposed \nto the outside world, facing multiple calamities along the way. As years pass, \ncharacters grow old and die, only to return as ghosts, or to be seemingly reincarnated \nin the next generation. When the American fruit company \ncomes to town, so does a romantic mechanic who is\nalways followed by yellow butterflies. A young woman up and floats away. Although the novel moves forward \nthrough subsequent generations, time moves in an almost cyclical manner. Many characters have similar names \nand features to their forebears, whose mistakes they often repeat. Strange prophecies \nand visits from mysterious gypsies give way to the skirmishes \nand firing squads of repeated civil wars. An American fruit company opens \na plantation near the village and ends up massacring thousands \nof striking workers, mirroring the real-life \n‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928. Combined with the novel’s magical realism, this produces a sense \nof history as a downward spiral the characters seem powerless to escape. Beneath the magic is a story \nabout the pattern of Colombian and Latin American history \nfrom colonial times onward. This is a history that \nthe author experienced firsthand. Gabriel García Márquez grew up\nin a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict between its Conservative \nand Liberal political parties. He also lived in an autocratic Mexico and covered the 1958 Venezuelan \ncoup d’état as a journalist. But perhaps his biggest influences \nwere his maternal grandparents. Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a\ndecorated veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against\nColombia's conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez \nto a socialist outlook. Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’\nomnipresent superstition became the foundation \nof One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style. Their small house in Aracataca \nwhere the author spent his childhood formed the main inspiration for Macondo. With One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez \nfound a unique way to capture the unique history \nof Latin America. He was able to depict the strange reality \nof living in a post-colonial society, forced to relive \nthe tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism,\nthe novel still holds hope. At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected \non Latin America’s long history of civil strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the\npossibility of building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able\nto decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned \nto one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever,\na second chance on earth.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many generations of the Buendía family are in One Hundred Years of Solitude?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "7"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In what year did Gabriel García Marquez start writing One Hundred Years of Solitude?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1967"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1965"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1982"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1928"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who inspired the style of One Hundred Years of Solitude?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Colonel Aureliano Buendía"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gabriel García Márquez"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Nicolás Ricardo Márquez"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which real-life event is almost directly represented in the novel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Banana Massacre of 1928"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Venezuelan coup d’état of 1958"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Thousand Days' War"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The bogotazo"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the name of the town where the novel is set?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Aracataca"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bogotá"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Macondo"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Colombia"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 24, "lesson": 17, "title": "Can you solve the Leonardo da Vinci riddle? - Tanya Khovanova", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-leonardo-da-vinci-riddle-tanya-khovanova", "transcript": {"en": "You’ve found Leonardo Da Vinci’s \nsecret vault, secured by a series of combination locks. Fortunately, your treasure map \nhas three codes: 1210, 3211000, and… hmm. The last one appears to be missing. Looks like you’re gonna have \nto figure it out on your own. There’s something those \nfirst two numbers have in common: they’re what’s called \nautobiographical numbers. This is a special type of number \nwhose structure describes itself. Each of an autobiographical\nnumber’s digits indicates how many times the digit corresponding to that\nposition occurs within the number. The first digit indicates \nthe quantity of zeroes, the second digit indicates \nthe number of ones, the third digit the number of twos, \nand so on until the end. The last lock takes a 10 digit number, and it just so happens that there’s exactly one ten-digit\nautobiographical number. What is it? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 Blindly trying different combinations \nwould take forever. So let’s analyze the autobiographical \nnumbers we already have to see what kinds of patterns we can find. By adding all the digits in 1210 together, we get 4 – the total number of digits. This makes sense \nsince each individual digit tells us the number of times a specific \ndigit occurs within the total. So the digits in our \nten-digit autobiographical number must add up to ten. This tells us another important thing – the number can’t have \ntoo many large digits. For example, if it included a 6 and a 7, then some digit would \nhave to appear 6 times, and another digit 7 times– making more than 10 digits. We can conclude \nthat there can be no more than one digit greater than 5 \nin the entire sequence. So out of the four digits 6, 7, 8, and 9, only one – if any-- will make the cut. And there will be zeroes in the positions corresponding to the numbers \nthat aren’t used. So now we know that our number\nmust contain at least three zeroes – which also means that the leading \ndigit must be 3 or greater. Now, while this first digit counts \nthe number of zeroes, every digit after it counts how many times\na particular non-zero digit occurs. If we add together \nall the digits besides the first one – and remember, \nzeroes don’t increase the sum – we get a count of how many \nnon-zero digits appear in the sequence, including that leading digit. For example, \nif we try this with the first code, we get 2 plus 1 equals 3 digits. Now, if we subtract one, we have a count of how many non-zero \ndigits there are after the first digit – two, in our example. Why go through all that? Well, we now know something important: the total quantity of non-zero digits\nthat occur after the first digit is equal to the sum of these digits, \nminus one. And how can you get a distribution\nwhere the sum is exactly 1 greater than the number of non-zero \npositive integers being added together? The only way is for one \nof the addends to be a 2, and the rest 1s. How many 1s? Turns out there can only be two – any more would require additional \ndigits like 3 or 4 to count them. So now we have the leading digit of 3 \nor greater counting the zeroes, a 2 counting the 1s, and two 1s – one to count the 2s and another to count the leading digit. And speaking of that, it’s time to find out \nwhat the leading digit is. Since we know that the 2 \nand the double 1s have a sum of 4, we can subtract that from 10 to get 6. Now it’s just a matter \nof putting them all in place: 6 zeroes, 2 ones, 1 two, 0 threes, 0 fours, 0 fives, 1 six, 0 sevens, 0 eights, and 0 nines. The safe swings open, \nand inside you find...

But the play’s depiction of Athens’ \nconduct during the Peloponnesian War was so controversial that afterwards, a politician named Kleon \ntook Aristophanes to court for \"slandering the people of Athens \nin the presence of foreigners.\" Aristophanes struck back two years later\nwith a play called The Knights. In it, he openly mocked Kleon, ending with Kleon’s character working as \na lowly sausage seller outside the city gates. This style of satire was a consequence of the unrestricted democracy \nof 5th century Athens and is now called \"Old Comedy.\" Aristophanes’ plays, the world’s earliest \nsurviving comic dramas, are stuffed full of parodies, songs, \nsexual jokes, and surreal fantasy. They often use wild situations, like a hero flying to heaven \non a dung beetle, or a net cast over a house to keep \nthe owner’s father trapped inside, in order to subvert audience expectations. And they’ve shaped how comedy’s\nbeen written and performed ever since. The word \"comedy\" comes from \nthe Ancient Greek \"komos,\" – revel, and \"oide,\" – singing, and it differed from its companion \nart form, \"tragedy\" in many ways. Where ancient Athenian tragedies dealt \nwith the downfall of the high and mighty, their comedies usually ended happily. And where tragedy almost always \nborrowed stories from legend, comedy addressed current events. Aristophanes’ comedies celebrated ordinary\npeople and attacked the powerful. His targets were arrogant politicians, war-mongering generals, and self-important intellectuals, exactly the people who sat in \nthe front row of the theatre, where everyone could see their reactions. As a result, they were referred to \nas komoidoumenoi: \"those made fun of in comedy.\" Aristophanes’ vicious \nand often obscene mockery held these leaders to account,\ntesting their commitment to the city. One issue, in particular, \ninspired much of Aristophanes’ work: the Peloponnesian War \nbetween Athens and Sparta. In Peace, written in 421 BC, a middle-aged Athenian frees \nthe embodiment of peace from a cave, where she’d been exiled \nby profiteering politicians. Then, in the aftermath of a crushing \nnaval defeat for Athens in 411 BC, Aristophanes wrote \"Lysistrata.\" In this play, the women \nof Athens grow sick of war and go on a sex strike \nuntil their husbands make peace. Other plays use similarly fantastic \nscenarios to skewer topical situations, such as in \"Clouds,\" where Aristophanes mocked \nfashionable philosophical thinking. The hero Strepsiades enrolls in\nSocrates’s new philosophical school, where he learns \nhow to prove that wrong is right and that a debt is not a debt. No matter how outlandish these plays get,\nthe heroes always prevail in the end. Aristophanes also became\nthe master of the parabasis, a comic technique where actors \naddress the audience directly, often praising the playwright \nor making topical comments and jokes. For example, in \"Birds,\" the Chorus takes \nthe role of different birds and threatens the Athenian judges that\nif their play doesn’t win first prize, they’ll defecate on them \nas they walk around the city. Perhaps the judges \ndidn’t appreciate the joke, as the play came in second. By exploring new ideas and encouraging self-criticism \nin Athenian society, Aristophanes not only \nmocked his fellow citizens, but he shaped the nature of comedy itself. Hailed by some scholars \nas the father of comedy, his fingerprints are visible \nupon comic techniques everywhere, from slapstick to double acts to impersonations to political satire. Through the praise of free speech \nand the celebration of ordinary heroes, his plays made his audience think \nwhile they laughed. And his retort to Kleon in 425 BC \nstill resonates today: “I’m a comedian, \nso I’ll speak about justice, no matter how hard \nit sounds to your ears.”"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who were Aristophanes’ main targets in his satirical plays?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The rich"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Women"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Politicians and generals"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Traders and soldiers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does ‘komoidoumenoi’ mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Old Comedy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Those made fun of in comedy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The community"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The comic performers"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who were the forces that fought in the Peloponnesian War?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Greece and Persia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Athens and Rome"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Athens and Sparta"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Greece and Egypt"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these is NOT one of Aristophanes’ plays?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Justice"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Clouds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Birds"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Peace"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How was a Parabasis used?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It addressed the audience directly to praise the playwright or make topical jokes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It gave instructions to the audience about the scenery on stage"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It was the process by which the winning play is announced"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It identified who was being mocked in the play"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

This question has inspired numerous myths, religious practices, and scientific inquiries. But Zen Buddhists practicing throughout \nChina from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question – why do we need an explanation? For these monks, blindly seeking answers \nwas a vice to overcome, and learning to accept\nthe mysteries of existence was the true path to enlightenment. But fighting the urge to explain \nthe unexplainable can be difficult. So to help practice living \nwith these mysteries, the meditating monks used a collection \nof roughly 1,700 bewildering and ambiguous philosophical\nthought experiments called kōans. The name, originally gong-an in Chinese,\ntranslates to “public record or case.\" But unlike real-world court cases,\nkōans were intentionally incomprehensible. They were surprising, surreal, \nand frequently contradicted themselves. On the surface, they contained a proverb\nabout the Zen Buddhist monastic code - such as living without physical\nor mental attachments, avoiding binary thinking, and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature.\" But by framing those lessons \nas illogical anecdotes, they became tests to help practicing monks\nlearn to live with ambiguity and paradox. By puzzling through \nthese confusing “cases,\" meditating monks could both internalize \nand practice Buddhist teachings. Hopefully, they would let go \nof the search for one true answer and trigger a spiritual breakthrough. Since these are intentionally \nunexplainable, it would be misguided to try \nand decipher these stories ourselves. But like the monks before us, we can puzzle over them together, and investigate just how resistant\nthey are to simple explanations. Consider this kōan illustrating the\npractice of no-attachment. Two monks, Tanzan and Ekido,\nare traveling together down a muddy road. Ahead they see an attractive traveler,\nunable to cross the muddy path. Tanzan politely offers his help, carrying the traveler \non his back across the street, and placing her down without a word. Ekido was shocked. According to monastic law,\nmonks were not supposed to go near women, let alone touch a beautiful stranger. After miles of walking,\nEkido could no longer restrain himself. “How could you carry that woman?” Tanzan smiled, “I left the traveler there.\nAre you still carrying her?” Like all kōans, \nthis story has numerous interpretations. But one popular reading suggests that despite never having \nphysically carried the traveler, Ekido broke monastic law \nby mentally \"clinging to\" the woman. This type of conflict – examining the grey area between the letter\nof the law and the spirit of the law – was common in kōans. In addition to exploring ambiguity, kōans often ridiculed characters claiming total understanding \nof the world around them. One such example finds three monks debating a temple flag \nrippling in the wind. The first monk refers to \nthe flag as a moving banner, while the second monk insists \nthat they are not seeing the flag move, but rather the wind blowing. They argue back and forth, \nuntil finally, a third monk intervenes, “It is not the flag moving, \nnor the wind blowing, but rather the movement of your minds!” One interpretation of this kōan plays on \nthe supposed wisdom of the arguing monks – the first asserting the importance \nof the observable world, the second favoring deeper knowledge \nwe can infer from that world. But each monk’s commitment \nto his own “answer” blinds him to the other’s insight, \nand in doing so, defies an essential Buddhist ideal:\nabolishing binary thinking. The third monk identifies \ntheir conflict as a perceptual one – both arguing monks \nfail to see the larger picture. Of course, all these interpretations only\nhint at how to wrestle with these kōans. Neither the wisdom \nfrom practicing monks before us, nor the supposedly wise characters \nin these stories can resolve them for you. That’s because the purpose of these kōans\nisn’t reaching a simple solution. It’s the very act of struggling \nwith these paradoxical puzzles which challenge our desire for resolution, and our understanding \nof understanding itself."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Koan literally means _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Court cases"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Public records or cases"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Philosophical thought experiments"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Monastic codes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In what way is Ekido still carrying the attractive traveler?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He is carrying her on his back"}, {"label": "B", "text": "He is imagining that he is carrying her on his back"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He is mentally clinging to the woman"}, {"label": "D", "text": "He is clinging to a monastic law"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In the \"temple flag\" koan, the third monk intervened by saying _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "\"The wind is blowing\""}, {"label": "B", "text": "\"The flag is rippling\""}, {"label": "C", "text": "\"The temple is shaking\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "\"Your minds are moving\""}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "One Buddhist ideal is to avoid or abolish _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Binary thinking"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Muddy paths"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mysteries"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Puzzles"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The purpose of koans is to _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Reach a simple solution to life problems"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Make people laugh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Challenge our understanding of understanding itself"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Memorize tricky anecdotes"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 24, "lesson": 20, "title": "How teachers can help kids find their political voices - Sydney Chaffee", "category": "History", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/3QeDY9Qn", "transcript": {"en": "social justice what do you think of to me social justice is a simple concept it's the notion that all people in a society deserve fair and equitable rights opportunities and access to resources but it's become controversial and nebulous because we've stopped talking about what working for social justice actually looks like working for social justice can look like this or this it can look like this or it can look like this or my favorite it can look like that those are my students and whenever I'm asked to articulate my work or my priorities as a teacher I explain that I believe education can be a tool for social justice but a few months ago I logged onto Twitter as I do and I saw that a fellow teacher had taken issue with that belief teachers he said should not be social justice warriors because the purpose of education is to educate and he ended his argument by saying I teach my subject but I reject that simplification because teachers don't just teach subjects we teach people when our students walk into our classrooms they bring their identities with them everything they experience in our rooms is bound up in historical context and so if we insist that education happens in a vacuum we do our students a disservice we teach them that education doesn't really matter because it's not relevant to what's happening all around them and what's happening all around them well racism for one in 2016 the University of Chicago released a report that revealed that according to results of the implicit association test fully eighty percent of white people harbored subconscious biases against black people believing them to be less intelligent lazier and more dangerous than whites and that's just one concrete example of the insidious effects of historic and systemic racism on our country for more evidence we could look at incarceration rates we could look at statistics on police violence against black people we could look at the opportunity gap in education so yeah social justice belongs in our schools social justice should be a part of the mission of every school and every teacher in America if we want liberty and justice for all to be more than a slogan because schools are crucial places for children to become active citizens and to learn the skills and the tools that they need to change the world so what are those skills okay here's a secret many of the skills that people need to orchestrate the kinds of change that will lead to justice are already built into the work of schools things like problem solving critical thinking collaboration perseverance none of that should be revolutionary on its own combine that with the ability to understand history not as one static and objective narrative on which we all agree but as a series of intertwined events about which there can be countless interpretations if we deliberately choose to explore history with our students rather than just teach it we help them understand that history is ongoing and that it's connected to current movements for justice and we help them see themselves as potential players within a living history so those are the skills I'm talking about when I say that education can be a place to help kids learn how to work for justice but maybe the reason that my Twitter critic wasn't happy with that idea is because he doesn't agree with my definition of justice fair enough maybe he and I don't see eye to eye politically but here's the thing our aim is to encourage students to articulate their own opinions not to coerce them into agreeing with us so it actually doesn't matter if he and I agree what matters is that we're helping students have those conversations with each other and that means that as adults we need to learn how to become effective facilitators of our students activism we've got to help them learn how to have really tricky conversations we have to expose them to different opinions and we have to have to help them see how what they're learning in school connects to the world outside so here's an example of that every year my students study the history of apartheid in South Africa as a case study of injustice now for those of you who don't know apartheid was a brutally racist system and the white ruled government in South Africa imposed racist laws to oppress people of color and if you resisted those laws you risked jail time violence or death and around the country other around the world of other countries governments including ours in the United States hesitated to sanction South Africa because well we benefited from its resources so in 1976 the South African government passed a new law which required that all students in South Africa learn in the language Afrikaans which was a white language and many black South Africans referred to that language as the language of the oppressor so not surprisingly students of color were outraged at this law they already attended segregated schools with overcrowded classrooms a lack of resources and a frankly racist curriculum and now they were being told to learn in a language neither they nor their teachers spoke so on the morning of June 16th 1976 thousands of kids from the township of Soweto walked out of schools and they marched peacefully through the streets to protest the law at an intersection they met up with the police and when the kids refused to turn back the police officers set dogs on them and then they opened fire and the Salado uprising ended in tragedy apartheid itself didn't end until almost 20 years later but the activism of those kids in Soweto profoundly changed the way the world viewed what was happening in of Africa news outlets all around the world published this photo of 13-year old Hector Pieterson who was one of the first people killed by police in Soweto and it became nearly impossible to ignore the brutality of the apartheid regime in the months and the years that followed the Salado uprising more and more countries exerted political and economic pressure on the South African government to end apartheid and it was largely due to the activism of those kids in Soweto so every year my kids learn about this and invariably they start to draw connections between those kids in Soweto and themselves and they start to ask themselves what kind of political power and agency they have they ask themselves whether there would ever be a reason they would risk their lives so that a future generation could live in a more just world and most profoundly for me every single year they ask themselves whether adults will ever listen to their voices a few years ago my principal got an anonymous email from one of our students it informed him that the following day the students planned to walk out of school this was in the wake of Michael Brown's death in Ferguson Missouri and the students were planning to join a walkout and March in support of the black lives matter movement so at this point the staff at the school had a decision to make would we use our authority and our power to try to control the students and prevent them from leaving or would we support them as they put into practice the principles of social justice that we had taught them about since their ninth grade year so the next morning the kids left school on mass and they gathered on the lawn and one of the seniors jumped up on a picnic table and went over safety expectations and the younger kids took it very seriously and as teachers and as staff we told them okay be safe and we watched as they marched off the kids who chose to stay spent that afternoon in class they debated the merits of protest they talked about the history of the black lives matter movement and they went on with classes as scheduled and those who chose to leave pretty Cepeda din a citywide student walk out and raise their collective voice for justice but no matter where they chose to spend the afternoon our kids learned valuable lessons that day they learn that the adults in their lives would support them even as we worried for their safety and they learn that they didn't need us to tell them how or when or even why to protest they learned that they were members of a community of young people with a shared vision of a more equitable society and they learned that they had power within that society they learned that events like the Soweto uprising are not ancient history and they don't have to end in tragedy and that's what education as a tool for social justice can look like and here's the thing our kids are ready for this kind of work so in 2015 incoming college freshmen were surveyed and eight point five percent of them said that they were there was a very good chance they would participate in a protest sometime during their college career and that might not seem very impressive but consider the fact that it's the largest number of students to say that since 1967 and seventy-five percent of those kids said that helping other people who are having difficulty was a very important or essential goal for them again the highest number of people to say that since the late 1960s and research shows us that working for justice doesn't just follow from building all those skills I talked about earlier it actually goes the other way too so working for justice engaging in activism helps students build skills like leadership and critical thinking and it correlates positively with their political participation and their civic engagement and their commitment to their communities later in life so in other words students are telling us that social justice matters to them and researchers are telling us that it helps students learn so now it's up to us to listen and that might not be easy in 1976 one of those kids who participated in Soweto in the uprising he said that that event represented divorce between black children and their families because their families had grown up under apartheid and they knew how dangerous it was to speak out they wanted their kids to lay low and stay safe and when our kids threatened to walk out a lot of the adults in our community were really conflicted too some of us worried that they might encounter violence other people worried that they would walk out but they wouldn't really know why they were protesting and some including some students families were really angry that the school hadn't done more to prevent them from leaving and all of those fears that adults have about getting this stuff wrong all of those fears make total sense but despite those fears we've got to prove to our students that we will listen to their voices and that they do have the power to affect change it's our responsibility to equip our students with the tools and the skills that they need to insist on a more equitable world and then sometimes to get out of their way and let them apply those skills to things that they care about and living up to that vision is going to require that we are flexible and it's going to require that we're creative it's gonna require that we're brave enough to stand up in the face of people who try to silence or D legitimize dissenting voices and hardest of all it's going to require accepting the fact that sometimes we will be the ones our students will rebel against sometimes they're gonna point out ways in which systems that we have created or in which we are complicit contribute to inequity it's going to be uncomfortable and it's going to be painful as they push us to question our own assumptions and beliefs but what if we change the way we think about rebellion in our kids when our kids rebel when they thoughtfully push back against our ideas or the way that we do things what if we chose to see that as a sign that we're doing something right and that they're becoming liberated I know it would be easier if their critical thinking skills manifested in more convenient ways on their essays or their standardized tests I get it convenience and justice do not often go hand in hand and when our kids learn to think critically about the world around them they become the kinds of engaged citizens who will recognize and question injustice when they see it and work to do something about it welcoming rebellion into our schools is going to require some rethinking about what teaching and learning look like because there's this misconception that if we give students any wiggle room they're gonna walk all over us and classrooms and dinner tables will devolve into total chaos and if we expect kids to sit silently and passively receive knowledge from us then their voices will always feel overwhelming but if we accept instead that learning is sometimes messy that it requires opportunities to brainstorm and mess up and try again that our kids dislike chaos and want to learn when they come to school then we can set up schools to facilitate that kind of learning so do me a favor and close your eyes for a second and imagine schools where teachers are thought partners letting students grapple with complex hard issues and not necessarily giving them the right answers and imagine schools where we let students make choices we trust them enough to do that and we let them experience the consequences of those choices imagine schools where we let students be humans with all of the messiness and the uncertainty that is bound to come with that and whatever you just imagined it's not mythical it's not unrealistically idealistic because teachers all over the country are already pushing the boundaries of what teaching and learning can look like with amazing results for kids they're doing that in all kinds of schools and there are countless models for teachers who want to get better at helping students learn in a way that's more authentic and engaging and empowering I was reading a book recently it's called the students are watching and is by Ted and Nancy sizer and in that book they said that the work of education is often described as a series of nouns like respect honesty integrity and they say those nouns sound really impressive but often they fail to actually mean anything in practice but verbs they say are active no less demanding but requiring constant engagement verbs are not structures but rather engines and so as I've read that I wondered how do we make engine how do we make justice into an engine driving our work as teachers what's the verb form of Justice I think there might be an answer to be found in the words of Cornel West who famously said that justice is what love looks like in public and all of my nerdy English teachers in the crowd know that love can be a noun and a verb school has to be bigger it has to mean more than I teach my subject school has to be about teaching people to change the world for the better if we believe that then teaching will always be a political act we can't be afraid of our students power their power will help them make tomorrow better but before they can do that we have to give them chances to practice today and that practice should start in our schools thank you very much [Applause] you"}, "multiple-choice": []}

In its prime, the Library of Alexandria housed \nan unprecedented number of scrolls and attracted some of \nthe Greek world’s greatest minds. But by the end of the 5th century CE,\nthe great library had vanished. Many believed it was destroyed \nin a catastrophic fire. The truth of the library’s rise \nand fall is much more complex. The idea for the library came \nfrom Alexander the Great. After establishing himself as a conqueror, the former student of Aristotle \nturned his attention to building an empire of knowledge \nheadquartered in his namesake city. He died before construction began, but his successor, Ptolemy I, executed Alexander’s plans \nfor a museum and library. Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built \nwith grand Hellenistic columns, native Egyptian influences, or a unique blend of the two--there are \nno surviving accounts of its architecture. We do know it had lecture halls, \nclassrooms, and, of course, shelves. As soon as the building was complete, Ptolemy I began to fill it with\nprimarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls. He invited scholars to live \nand study in Alexandria at his expense. The library grew as they contributed \ntheir own manuscripts, but the rulers of Alexandria still wanted \na copy of every book in the world. Luckily, Alexandria was a hub for ships\ntraveling through the Mediterranean. Ptolemy III instituted a policy requiring \nany ship that docked in Alexandria to turn over its books for copying. Once the Library’s scribes \nhad duplicated the texts, they kept the originals \nand sent the copies back to the ships. Hired book hunters also scoured \nthe Mediterranean in search of new texts, and the rulers of Alexandria attempted \nto quash rivals by ending all exports of the Egyptian \npapyrus used to make scrolls. These efforts brought hundreds \nof thousands of books to Alexandria. As the library grew, it became possible to find information \non more subjects than ever before, but also much more difficult to find \ninformation on any specific subject. Luckily, a scholar named Callimachus of\nCyrene set to work on a solution, creating the pinakes, a 120-volume catalog \nof the library’s contents, the first of its kind. Using the pinakes, others were able to navigate \nthe Library’s swelling collection. They made some astounding discoveries. 1,600 years before Columbus set sail, Eratosthenes not only realized \nthe earth was round, but calculated its circumference \nand diameter within a few miles of their actual size. Heron of Alexandria created \nthe world’s first steam engine over a thousand years before it was finally reinvented during \nthe Industrial Revolution. For about 300 years after its founding \nin 283 BCE, the library thrived. But then, in 48 BCE, Julius Caesar \nlaid siege to Alexandria and set the ships in the harbor on fire. For years, scholars believed the library \nburned as the blaze spread into the city. It's possible the fire destroyed \npart of the sprawling collection, but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit \nthe library for centuries after the siege. Ultimately, the library slowly disappeared\nas the city changed from Greek, to Roman, Christian, and eventually Muslim hands. Each new set of rulers viewed \nits contents as a threat rather than a source of pride. In 415 CE, the Christian rulers even had \na mathematician named Hypatia murdered for studying \nthe library’s ancient Greek texts, which they viewed as blasphemous. Though the Library of Alexandria \nand its countless texts are long gone, we’re still grappling \nwith the best ways to collect, access, and preserve our knowledge. There’s more information available today and more advanced technology \nto preserve it, though we can’t know for sure that our digital archives \nwill be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria’s ink and paper scrolls. And even if our reservoirs of knowledge \nare physically secure, they will still have to resist \nthe more insidious forces that tore the library apart: fear of knowledge, and the arrogant belief \nthat the past is obsolete.

Shingleback lizards also\nhave a tough pregnancy. These reptiles usually have\none to two babies at a time, which doesn't sound so bad, until you realize that combined, the babies make up a third\nof the mother's body weight. That's like a human giving\nbirth to a seven year old! But a baby doesn't need\nto be big to be difficult. Take the porcupine. Those sharp spines\nprotect it from predators, but they're sometimes not so fun for Mom. You see, baby porcupines,\ncalled porcupettes, aren't hairless like most rodent newborns. These guys are born fully quilled. Normally, this isn't a problem for Mom, since the quills are soft at birth, and gradually harden\nover the next few hours. But complications can arise when the porcupettes are\nfacing the wrong direction, because their quills can get caught in the birth canal on the way out. Speaking of birth canals, the spotted hyena has an interesting one. Females have phallic-like genitalia. The scientific term for\nthis is pseudo-penis, and they give birth out\nof the pseudo-penis, which will sometimes rip\napart in the process. It's not only painful, it can be lethal. In fact, about 15% of first-time\nmothers die giving birth. But, believe it or not, a species of velvet\nspider has it even worse. You know how some animals\nchew up food for their babies? Well, Stegodyphus lineatus\ntakes this to a whole new level. Right after she lays an egg sac, the mother's tissues start to degrade. Once the spiderlings hatch, she regurgitates her\nown liquified insides, and the babies chow down. Nine days later, they suck\nup the last of her fluids, and strike out on their own, leaving nothing but an empty husk. Thanks Mom. But childbirth isn't just dangerous or uncomfortable for mothers. With some animals, the\nbaby has it pretty rough. Take the Tasmanian devil. The mom gives birth to\nup to 50 joeys at a time, each the size of a raisin. They have to crawl from\nthe mother's birth canal, over her body, and into her pouch, where they'll snuggle up\nfor another four months. But there's a catch. Mom has only four nipples in her pouch. So right from birth the joeys are literally on\na mad dash for their lives, and only the strongest four will make it. Talk about sibling rivalry, huh? Overall, one thing is clear: humans aren't the only\nones who have it rough when it comes to giving birth. What's the craziest animal fact you know?

Here in Hong Kong there are dragons\nfloating everywhere. You can't really see them, because you know they're dragons.\nThey actually live up in the mountains and they come down into the water and\nwhen you block them from entering the water you end up really messing up your\nluck. So they have accommodated this situation by putting holes in the\nbuildings so that the dragons can fly through. These are called dragon gates\nand they are one of many examples of how Feng Shui, the ancient Chinese practice,\nis affecting the skyline of Hong Kong. So Feng Shui is this ancient Chinese\nbelief, superstition. The basic idea is that there is good energy out there\nfloating around, good luck, good fortune called Qi and if you arrange your\nphysical environment in an optimal way, you can channel that good luck in the\nbest way and things will go good for you. This usually takes the form of like\nfurniture, interior design but here in Hong Kong, it has affected the skyline. Alright, first let's look at this HSBC\nbuilding. The Hong Kong Shanghai Bank was founded back in the days of pirates and\nopium barons. First thing you'll notice is that it's nicely squared off, with the\nmountains in the back and harbor in the front. This is really good composition for the Qi to flow. Not only is the lobby\nelevated but it's also the escalators are at this angle. It's kind of a weird\nlooking angle. That's intentional as well, because it's actually meant to fend off\nthe bad luck as it's coming through this hole in the bottom of the building. And then of course the opposite is true; if you don't arrange your physical\nenvironment in an optimal way, then bad luck will befall you. Right next door is\nthe Communist Bank of Red China. The developers of this building explicitly\nignored the Feng Shui masters who were concerned that the sharp angles of this\ndesign would cut the good Qi and create bad luck for all of the surrounding\nbuildings. The people who thought this had their suspicions reinforced when\nshortly after the building was complete, bad stuff started happening around it. Like to this neighboring building, which has been riddled with financial insecurity, corporate collapse, bankruptcies, since it's very beginning. And Feng Shui\nmasters have come out and cited the bad Feng Shui of the area as a major cause\nfor these events. Governor of Hong Kong at the time, whose house sits in the\nshadow of this building, died of a fatal heart attack just one year after this\nbuilding was complete. So the HSBC building, in response, put up these\nmaintenance cranes that actually look like cannons and they're pointed right\nat the Bank of China, in order to combat all of this bad luck that's coming from\nthis sharp building. When developers are designing and\nputting up these buildings, they hire these Feng Shui consultants. They spend\nmillions of dollars on consultants who will give them advice and approve their\ndesign decisions, to make sure that they're in keeping with good Feng Shui. Out here in Disneyland Hong Kong, the Feng Shui masters said that the entrance\nwas in a bad position for keeping good luck in the park. So they shifted the entrance by 12 degrees in order to create a blockade\nfrom the good luck escaping the park and ruining the prosperity of this place. Feng Shui comes from China, mainland China, but during the Cultural Revolution\nChina kind of stamped out some of these old practices that they believed were\nholding the society back. And Feng Shui fell victim to that, but Hong Kong at\nthat time was ruled by the British. It was a British colony, so it didn't fall\nsubject to that Cultural Revolution and Feng Shui was preserved in a very\nmainstream way. Check out this building, it's the Hopewell Center. When this thing went up, people freaked out because it kind of looked like a candle or like a\nsmoking cigarette. They put a swimming pool on the top, in order to extinguish\nthe fire and make sure that it didn't mess with the good luck of the city. The government takes this stuff really seriously too. Between 2011 and 2016 they\npaid out $1.1 million dollars in Feng Shui disturbance subsidies. This is paid\nout to people who complain that new constructions disrupt their Fung Shui\nand they get compensated by the government. So next time you are crossing\nthis harbor to look at these beautiful buildings, just remember that Feng Shui is at\nis at play in Hong Kong's skyline."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In Hong Kong, holes have been placed in buildings so that _______ can fly through.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "a flock of birds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "air"}, {"label": "C", "text": "dragons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "drones"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The Hopewell Center looked like a candle or smoking cigarette so, to make sure it didn’t mess with the good luck of the city, they:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "put up maintenance cranes that looked like cannons, in order to combat the bad bad luc"}, {"label": "B", "text": "created additional floors and holes in the buildings."}, {"label": "C", "text": "created sharp angles to cut the good Qi"}, {"label": "D", "text": "put a swimming pool on top, in order to extinguish the fire"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
