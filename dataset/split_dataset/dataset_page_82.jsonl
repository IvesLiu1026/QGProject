{"page": 82, "lesson": 1, "title": "How miscommunication happens (and how to avoid it) - Katherine Hampsten", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-avoid-miscommunication-katherine-hampsten", "transcript": {"en": "Have you ever talked with a friend\nabout a problem only to realize that he just doesn't seem to grasp\nwhy the issue is so important to you? Have you ever presented an idea to\na group and it's met with utter confusion? Or maybe you've been in an argument when the other person suddenly accuses you of not listening \nto what they're saying at all? What's going on here? The answer is miscommunication, and in some form or another, we've all experienced it. It can lead to confusion, animosity, misunderstanding, or even crashing a multimillion\ndollar probe into the surface of Mars. The fact is even when face-to-face\nwith another person, in the very same room, and speaking the same language, human communication is incredibly complex. But the good news is \nthat a basic understanding of what happens when we communicate can help us prevent miscommunication. For decades, researchers have asked,\n\"What happens when we communicate?\" One interpretation,\ncalled the transmission model, views communication as a message that\nmoves directly from one person to another, similar to someone tossing a ball\nand walking away. But in reality, this simplistic model doesn't account\nfor communication's complexity. Enter the transactional model, which acknowledges the many \nadded challenges of communicating. With this model, it's more accurate\nto think of communication between people as a game of catch. As we communicate our message,\nwe receive feedback from the other party. Through the transaction,\nwe create meaning together. But from this exchange,\nfurther complications arise. It's not like the Star Trek universe, where some characters \ncan Vulcan mind meld, fully sharing thoughts and feelings. As humans, we can't help but send\nand receive messages through our own subjective lenses. When communicating, one person expresses\nher interpretation of a message, and the person she's communicating with hears his own interpretation \nof that message. Our perceptual filters continually shift\nmeanings and interpretations. Remember that game of catch? Imagine it with a lump of clay. As each person touches it, they shape it to fit \ntheir own unique perceptions based on any number of variables, like knowledge or past experience, \nage, race, gender, ethnicity, religion, or family background. Simultaneously, every person interprets\nthe message they receive based on their relationship \nwith the other person, and their unique understanding of the semantics and connotations \nof the exact words being used. They could also be distracted\nby other stimuli, such as traffic or a growling stomach. Even emotion might cloud \ntheir understanding, and by adding more people\ninto a conversation, each with their own subjectivities, the complexity of communication\ngrows exponentially. So as the lump of clay goes back and forth\nfrom one person to another, reworked, reshaped, and always changing, it's no wonder our messages sometimes\nturn into a mush of miscommunication. But, luckily, there are some \nsimple practices that can help us all navigate our daily\ninteractions for better communication. One: recognize that passive hearing\nand active listening are not the same. Engage actively with the verbal\nand nonverbal feedback of others, and adjust your message to facilitate\ngreater understanding. Two: listen with your eyes and ears,\nas well as with your gut. Remember that communication \nis more than just words. Three: take time to understand as you try\nto be understood. In the rush to express ourselves, it's easy to forget that communication\nis a two-way street. Be open to what \nthe other person might say. And finally, four: Be aware of your personal \nperceptual filters. Elements of your experience, including your culture, \ncommunity, and family, influence how you see the world. Say, \"This is how I see the problem,\nbut how do you see it?\" Don't assume that your perception\nis the objective truth. That'll help you work toward sharing\na dialogue with others to reach a common understanding together."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The ______ communication model suggests that communication is a simple message delivery from one person to another.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Horizontal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Transmission"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Transactional"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Most recent"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following influences our perceptual filters?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Age"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Religion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Family"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above are influences"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of these activities is the most intentional?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Listening"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hearing"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Under the transactional model, communication is like playing a game of toss with:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Balloon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Baseball"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ball of clay"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hot potato"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What can we do to listen more effectively?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pay attention only to the words being said"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Focus primarily on what we want to say next"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Listen to the words being said, but also pay attention to visual cues and emotions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Avoid making eye contact"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Now that may seem\nlike a strong reaction from my friend to the words of a total stranger, but she's not alone. I'm a social scientist. I study the psychology of good people, and research in my field says\nmany of us care deeply about feeling like a good person\nand being seen as a good person. Now, your definition of \"good person\"\nand your definition of \"good person\" and maybe the taxi driver's\ndefinition of \"good person\" -- we may not all have the same definition, but within whatever our definition is, that moral identity\nis important to many of us. Now, if somebody challenges it,\nlike they question us for a joke we tell, or maybe we say\nour workforce is homogenous, or a slippery business expense, we go into red-zone defensiveness\na lot of the time. I mean, sometimes we call out all the ways in which we help\npeople from marginalized groups, or we donate to charity, or the hours we volunteer to nonprofits. We work to protect\nthat good person identity. It's important to many of us. But what if I told you this? What if I told you that our attachment\nto being good people is getting in the way\nof us being better people? What if I told you that our definition\nof \"good person\" is so narrow, it's scientifically impossible to meet? And what if I told you\nthe path to being better people just begins with letting go\nof being a good person? Now, let me tell you a little bit\nabout the research about how the human mind works to explain. The brain relies on shortcuts\nto do a lot of its work. That means a lot of the time, your mental processes are taking place\noutside of your awareness, like in low-battery, low-power mode\nin the back of your mind. That's, in fact, the premise\nof bounded rationality. Bounded rationality is\nthe Nobel Prize-winning idea that the human mind\nhas limited storage resources, limited processing power, and as a result, it relies on shortcuts\nto do a lot of its work. So for example, some scientists estimate\nthat in any given moment ... Better, better click, right? There we go. (Laughter) At any given moment, 11 million pieces of information\nare coming into your mind. Eleven million. And only 40 of them\nare being processed consciously. So 11 million, 40. I mean, has this ever happened to you? Have you ever had\na really busy day at work, and you drive home, and when you get in the door, you realize you don't\neven remember the drive home, like whether you had\ngreen lights or red lights. You don't even remember.\nYou were on autopilot. Or have you ever opened the fridge, looked for the butter, swore there is no butter, and then realized the butter\nwas right in front of you the whole time? These are the kinds of \"whoops\" moments\nthat make us giggle, and this is what happens in a brain that can handle 11 million\npieces of information coming in with only 40 being processed consciously. That's the bounded part\nof bounded rationality. This work on bounded rationality is what's inspired work I've done\nwith my collaborators Max Bazerman and Mahzarin Banaji, on what we call bounded ethicality. So it's the same premise\nas bounded rationality, that we have a human mind\nthat is bounded in some sort of way and relying on shortcuts, and that those shortcuts\ncan sometimes lead us astray. With bounded rationality, perhaps it affects the cereal\nwe buy in the grocery store, or the product we launch in the boardroom. With bounded ethicality, the human mind, the same human mind, is making decisions, and here, it's about who to hire next, or what joke to tell or that slippery business decision. So let me give you an example\nof bounded ethicality at work. Unconscious bias is one place where we see the effects\nof bounded ethicality. So unconscious bias refers\nto associations we have in our mind, the shortcuts your brain is using\nto organize information, very likely outside of your awareness, not necessarily lining up\nwith your conscious beliefs. Researchers Nosek, Banaji and Greenwald have looked at data\nfrom millions of people, and what they've found is, for example, most white Americans\ncan more quickly and easily associate white people and good things than black people and good things, and most men and women\ncan more quickly and easily associate men and science than women and science. And these associations\ndon't necessarily line up with what people consciously think. They may have\nvery egalitarian views, in fact. So sometimes, that 11 million\nand that 40 just don't line up. And here's another example: conflicts of interest. So we tend to underestimate\nhow much a small gift -- imagine a ballpoint pen or dinner -- how much that small gift\ncan affect our decision making. We don't realize that our mind\nis unconsciously lining up evidence to support the point of view\nof the gift-giver, no matter how hard we're consciously\ntrying to be objective and professional. We also see bounded ethicality -- despite our attachment\nto being good people, we still make mistakes, and we make mistakes\nthat sometimes hurt other people, that sometimes promote injustice, despite our best attempts, and we explain away our mistakes\nrather than learning from them. Like, for example, when I got an email\nfrom a female student in my class saying that a reading I had assigned, a reading I had been assigning for years, was sexist. Or when I confused\ntwo students in my class of the same race -- look nothing alike -- when I confused them for each other more than once, in front of everybody. These kinds of mistakes send us, send me, into red-zone defensiveness. They leave us fighting\nfor that good person identity. But the latest work that I've been doing\non bounded ethicality with Mary Kern says that we're not\nonly prone to mistakes -- that tendency towards mistakes depends\non how close we are to that red zone. So most of the time, nobody's challenging\nour good person identity, and so we're not thinking too much about the ethical implications\nof our decisions, and our model shows\nthat we're then spiraling towards less and less\nethical behavior most of the time. On the other hand, somebody\nmight challenge our identity, or, upon reflection,\nwe may be challenging it ourselves. So the ethical implications\nof our decisions become really salient, and in those cases, we spiral towards\nmore and more good person behavior, or, to be more precise, towards more and more behavior\nthat makes us feel like a good person, which isn't always the same, of course. The idea with bounded ethicality is that we are perhaps overestimating the importance our inner compass\nis playing in our ethical decisions. We perhaps are overestimating\nhow much our self-interest is driving our decisions, and perhaps we don't realize\nhow much our self-view as a good person is affecting our behavior, that in fact, we're working so hard\nto protect that good person identity, to keep out of that red zone, that we're not actually giving ourselves\nspace to learn from our mistakes and actually be better people. It's perhaps because\nwe expect it to be easy. We have this definition\nof good person that's either-or. Either you are a good person\nor you're not. Either you have integrity or you don't. Either you are a racist or a sexist\nor a homophobe or you're not. And in this either-or definition,\nthere's no room to grow. And by the way, this is not what we do\nin most parts of our lives. Life, if you needed to learn accounting, you would take an accounting class, or if you become a parent, we pick up a book and we read about it. We talk to experts, we learn from our mistakes, we update our knowledge, we just keep getting better. But when it comes to being a good person, we think it's something\nwe're just supposed to know, we're just supposed to do, without the benefit of effort or growth. So what I've been thinking about is what if we were to just forget\nabout being good people, just let it go, and instead, set a higher standard, a higher standard\nof being a good-ish person? A good-ish person\nabsolutely still makes mistakes. As a good-ish person,\nI'm making them all the time. But as a good-ish person,\nI'm trying to learn from them, own them. I expect them and I go after them. I understand there are costs\nto these mistakes. When it comes to issues like ethics\nand bias and diversity and inclusion, there are real costs to real people, and I accept that. As a good-ish person, in fact, I become better\nat noticing my own mistakes. I don't wait for people to point them out. I practice finding them, and as a result ... Sure, sometimes it can be embarrassing, it can be uncomfortable. We put ourselves\nin a vulnerable place, sometimes. But through all that vulnerability, just like in everything else\nwe've tried to ever get better at, we see progress. We see growth. We allow ourselves to get better. Why wouldn't we give ourselves that? In every other part of our lives,\nwe give ourselves room to grow -- except in this one, where it matters most. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Peter Stubbe was accused\nof several gruesome crimes, including murder, assault,\nand cannibalism. But perhaps the most sinister accusation\nof them all, was of being a werewolf. In his confession, Peter claimed that\nthe devil had given him a magic girdle, which allowed him to transform into a wolf\nand perform his horrific acts. Stories of werewolves existed well before\nthis trial and continue to live on today. They’re especially prominent\nin European literature and folklore, and often found in cultures where the wolf\nis the largest natural predator. Over the years, the image of the werewolf\nhas continuously evolved, often reflecting the fears and prejudices\nof that time. In early literature, werewolves were\nsometimes painted as sympathetic figures: victims of curses who longed to return\nto their human form. In the story of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest written accounts of\nwerewolves from over 4.000 years ago, a shepherd falls in love\nwith the goddess of love, Ishtar, who transforms him into a wolf\nwhen she grows tired of his affection. In this and several other\nstories that followed, werewolves were often men who had fallen\nprey to deceitful, alluring women. In the medieval story of “Bisclavret,” a knight is trapped in wolf form\nby the cunning of his wife, who leaves him to elope with another man. Other early stories explored fears\nabout the darker side of human nature, including taboos such as\ncannibalism and murder. In ancient Greek mythology, King Lycaon was transformed\ninto a wolf by Zeus, after he attempted to trick the god\ninto eating human flesh. As Catholicism spread throughout Europe, werewolves became increasingly linked\nto magic, sorcery, and pagan belief. By the 16th century, many people struggled\nseparating werewolf fiction from fact. Political, economic,\nand religious upheavals gave rise to the infamous\nEuropean witch trials. And while witches were the main\ntargets, in some areas, alleged werewolves like Peter Stubbe\nwere also tried and executed. Today, some historians view the trials\nas driven by a fear of outsiders, as well as society's early attempts\nto understand brutal crimes. While public belief in werewolves\ndied down by the 17th century as medicine and psychology advanced, the myth would re-emerge in literature. By the Victorian period,\nwerewolves had transformed again, often embodying fears of moral\nand psychological decay. In George Reynolds’s\n“Wagner the Wehrwolf,” the protagonist makes a pact with the\ndevil to achieve eternal youth. But in return, he transforms\ninto a violent howling wolf at the end of every month. By the mid-20th century, werewolves found a new home to haunt—\nthe silver screen. Here, the werewolf began to take\nits modern form. For example, the idea that the curse\ncould be transmitted through bites and triggered by a full moon was first popularized with the\n1935 film “Werewolf of London.” Produced in the United States, the film identifies the werewolf infection\nas originating from the east— specifically Tibet. This mirrored xenophobic fears\nof the time— that East Asian immigrants\ninto North America and Europe threatened the stability and power\nof the west. Werewolf hunters adopted silver\nas their weapon of choice after its use in 1941′s “The Wolf Man.” Written by Jewish writer Curt Siodmak, the film is viewed by many scholars\nas an allegory for Nazi brutality. In the film, a pentagram appears on the\npalm of the werewolf’s next victim, which is thought to allude to the\ncompulsory Star of David badges found in Europe during the 1930 and 40s. Since the 1950s, cinematic werewolves have\nfrequently infected a new group of victims: the teenager. Here, werewolves are often symbols\nof male aggression and the uncertainty of adolescence. By the end of the century, some films began to use\nthe beastly transformation to explore themes of puberty, occasionally with a distinctly\nfeminist perspective. Yet, like all great monsters,\nthe werewolf lives on, and will continue changing to fit\nits future audience’s needs. But, for the time being, it may\nbe best to stock up on silver, keep to the road, and beware the moon."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the name of the king who tried to trick Zeus into eating human flesh?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Theseus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lycaon"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pericles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Minos"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What 1941 film helped popularize the use of silver as a key weakness for the werewolf?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Werewolf"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Curse of the Werewolf"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Wolf Man"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Werewolf of London"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In the 1935 film \"Werewolf of London,\" where does the werewolf infection originate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "England"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tibet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "France"}, {"label": "D", "text": "China"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How did the 16th century criminal Peter Stubbe claim to be transformed into a werewolf?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "He was given a magical girdle."}, {"label": "B", "text": "He was bitten by a werewolf."}, {"label": "C", "text": "His father was a werewolf."}, {"label": "D", "text": "He was cursed by a witch."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In George Reynolds’s \"Wagner the Wehr-Wolf,\" when does the novel’s main protagonist transform into a werewolf?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "During a full moon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "At midnight on Christmas Eve"}, {"label": "C", "text": "On his birthday"}, {"label": "D", "text": "At sunset on the last day of every month"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 82, "lesson": 4, "title": "How (and why) to read William Faulkner - Sascha Morrell", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-is-william-faulkner-so-difficult-to-read-sascha-morrell", "transcript": {"en": "You’re halfway through what’s supposedly one of the greatest\nnovels of the 20th century, but nothing quite makes sense. Narrating characters offer clashing\nversions of the same story and often seem unsure who, what,\nor when they’re talking about. Seemingly minor details trigger intense\nemotional reactions you don't understand. And the prose is loaded with convoluted\nsentences and outlandish imagery. Confused? Good— that means\nyou’re on the right track. William Faulkner is considered\none of America’s most remarkable and perplexing writers. Fortunately, he wasn’t just\ntoying with his audience. Faulkner used confusion intentionally, to explore the most mysterious parts\nof the human mind and investigate pressing issues of\npersonal, racial, and regional identity. The result is a body of work that’s\nshocking, inventive, and often hilarious— but above all, challenging. So what clues should readers look\nfor to navigate his literary labyrinths? Many of Faulkner’s novels are set\nin the fictional county of Yoknapatawpha— a fantastical reimagining \nof Lafayette County, Mississippi, where he spent most of his life. Born in 1897, Faulkner grew up steeped\nin oral storytelling traditions, from folklore and family histories\nto local legends of Civil War glory. However, these grand myths didn’t match\nthe messy reality of the American South, divided by racist Jim Crow laws and plagued by the legacies of slavery\nand colonial violence. All these tensions come alive \ninside Yoknapatawpha. Full of horror, humor, and human tragedy, Faulkner’s stories feature \nmany memorable characters, like the spurned bride who sleeps\nbeside her would-be husband’s corpse, or the duped sharecropper obsessively\nhunting for imaginary coins. At first glance, these characters\nseem grotesquely absurd. But under the surface, \nthey all reflect his obsession with how people process the past— what they stubbornly hold on to,\nunwittingly forget and willingly distort. Much of Faulkner’s fiction is told\nfrom multiple perspectives, offering the reader several versions\nof the story’s events. For example, “The Sound and the Fury”\ncombines the narratives of Benjy, Quentin, and Jason Compson, three brothers haunted by memories\nof their sister Caddy. One brother's narration will occasionally\nfill the gaps left by another's, but just as often,\ntheir accounts contradict each other. To make things more confusing, \nBenjy’s narration is disjointed in time, slipping between past and present\nwithout warning. Meanwhile, Quentin's section\nconfuses fact and fantasy as it jumps backward in time\nfrom the day of his untimely death. Only the aggressive, money-hungry Jason\nattempts to embrace the present— but even he is constantly overtaken\nby past resentments. Following these threads\ncan be bewildering, but Faulkner wants the audience to share\nin the characters’ confusion. This approach allows readers\nto understand the Compsons’ biases and blindspots firsthand. And since his characters’ distortions\nof the past often reflect larger denials\nof Southern history, it also allows Faulkner to explore \nhis own anxieties about the South. For example, his novel “Light in August”\ndeliberately induces ambiguity about a character’s racial origins in ways\nthat undermine rigid Jim Crow policies. And in “Absalom, Absalom!”\nnarrating townsfolk remark that “no one knew how” a local landowner had come\ninto his property, and that his house was built\n“apparently out of nothing.” This kind of evasive language shows how\ncharacters are desperate to cover up the region's intolerable history\nof genocide and slavery. But even when exploring\nthe heaviest topics, Faulkner spellbinds readers\nwith verbal acrobatics. One particularly bewildering sentence\nin “Absalom, Absalom!” runs 1,288 words long, and features locals haggling\nover “violently-colored candy,” a “cloudy swirl of chickens,”\nand a hard-drinking planter who’s compared to both \na worn-out cannon and a showgirl. Even his jokes can breed more confusion, such as when Benjy Compson conflates\nhis sister Caddy with golf caddies. Reading Faulkner is rarely easy,\nbut it is deeply rewarding. He invites readers to contemplate the\nunreliable nature of history and memory. And in teaching us to embrace confusion and recognize the limits \nof our perception, Faulkner can help us listen \nfor hidden meanings in the sound and fury that surround us."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following profoundly shaped Faulkner’s fiction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Slavery"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The American Civil War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oral storytelling traditions"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following does NOT commonly feature in William Faulkner’s fiction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Convoluted sentences"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Departures from chronological order"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Happy endings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Unreliable narrators"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following problems do the Compson brothers share in \"The Sound and the Fury\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gambling debts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A fixation on the past"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hemophilia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Premonitions of catastrophe"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who is Caddy in Faulkner’s \"The Sound and the Fury\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The estranged sister of Benjy, Quentin, and Jason Compson "}, {"label": "B", "text": "The ex-wife of the planter Thomas Sutpen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A spurned bride suspected of murdering her lover"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Compson brothers’ hypochondriac mother"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following best describes the view of history presented in Faulkner’s fiction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "If we don’t learn from the past, we are destined to repeat it."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is best to forget the past and focus on the future."}, {"label": "C", "text": "Historical memory is shaped and distorted by powerful collective myths."}, {"label": "D", "text": "Historical progress is guided by divine agency."}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 82, "lesson": 5, "title": "How to manage your emotions", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-manage-your-emotions", "transcript": {"en": "You and your friend need to ace \nFriday’s exam to avoid summer classes, and after a week of studying, you both\nfeel confident that you pulled it off. But when you get your grades back, they’re much lower \nthan the two of you expected. You’re devastated. However, your friend doesn't\nseem too bothered, and it's making you wonder why you can't\nshake this off like they can. But should you really be trying\nto look on the bright side? And is controlling our emotions \neven possible in the first place? The answer to the last question\nis a definitive “yes.” There are numerous strategies\nfor regulating our emotions, and one framework to understand these\ntechniques is called the Process Model. Psychologists use this tool to identify\nwhere and how to intervene in the process that forms our emotions. That process has four steps: first, we enter a situation, \nreal or imagined, and that draws our attention. Then we evaluate, or appraise, \nthe situation and whether it helps or hinders our goals. Finally, this appraisal leads to a set of \nchanges in how we feel, think, and behave, known as an emotional response. Each step of this process offers \nan opportunity to consciously intervene and change our emotions, and the Process Model outlines what \nstrategies we might try at each phase. To see this in action, let’s imagine\nyou’ve been invited to the same party as your least-favorite ex\nand their new partner. Your first strategy could be avoiding\nthe situation altogether by skipping the party. But if you do attend, you could also try \nmodifying the situation by choosing not to interact with your ex. If that’s proving difficult,\nyou might want to shift your attention, maybe by playing a game with your friends rather than focusing \non your ex’s new partner. Another option would be to re-evaluate\nhow you think about the situation. After seriously reappraising things, you might realize that you don’t\ncare who your ex dates. If none of these strategies work, you can always try tempering \nyour emotional response after the fact. But this can be tricky. Many of the easiest ways to do this, like hiding your emotions or trying \nto change them with recreational drugs, generally lead to more negative feelings\nand health concerns in the long term. More sustainable strategies here include\ngoing for a long walk, taking slow, deep breaths, or talking \nwith someone in your support system. While using all these strategies well \ntakes practice, learning to notice your emotions and reflect on where they’re coming from\nis half the battle. And once you’ve truly internalized \nthat you can regulate your emotions, doing so becomes much easier. But should you use these techniques \nto constantly maintain a good mood? That answer depends on how you define\nwhat makes a mood “good.” It's tempting to think we should always\ntry to avoid sadness and frustration, but no emotion is inherently good or bad— they’re either helpful or unhelpful\ndepending on the situation. For example, if a friend is telling you\nabout the loss of a loved one, feeling and expressing sadness \nisn’t just appropriate, it can help you empathize\nand support them. Conversely, while it’s unhealthy \nto regularly ignore your emotions, forcing a smile to get through a one-time\nannoyance is perfectly reasonable. We hear a lot of mixed messages\nabout emotions. Some pressure us to stay upbeat while others tell us to simply take \nour emotions as they come. But in reality,\neach person has to find their own balance. So if the question is:\n“should you always try to be happy?” The answer is no.

Chance", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/are-insect-brains-the-secret-to-great-ai-frances-s-chance", "transcript": {"en": "Creating intelligence on a computer. This has been the Holy Grail\nfor artificial intelligence for quite some time. But how do we get there? So we view ourselves as highly\nintelligent beings. So it's logical to study our own brains, the substrate of our cognition,\nfor creating artificial intelligence. Imagine if we could replicate\nhow our own brains work on a computer. But now consider the journey\nthat would be required. The human brain contains\n86 billion neurons. Each is constantly communicating\nwith thousands of others, and each has individual\ncharacteristics of its own. Capturing the human brain on a computer may simply be too big\nand too complex a problem to tackle with the technology\nand the knowledge that we have today. I believe that we can capture\na brain on a computer, but we have to start smaller. Much smaller. These insects have three of the most\nfascinating brains in the world to me. While they do not possess\nhuman-level intelligence, each is remarkable at a particular task. Think of them as highly\ntrained specialists. African dung beetles are really good\nat rolling large balls in straight lines. (Laughter) Now, if you've ever made a snowman, you know that rolling\na large ball is not easy. Now picture trying to make that snowman when the ball of snow is as big as you are and you're standing on your head. (Laughter) Sahara desert ants\nare navigation specialists. They might have to wander a considerable\ndistance to forage for food. But once they do find sustenance, they know how to calculate\nthe straightest path home. And the dragonfly is a hunting specialist. In the wild, dragonflies capture\napproximately 95 percent of the prey they choose to go after. These insects are so good\nat their specialties that neuroscientists such as myself\nstudy them as model systems to understand how animal nervous systems\nsolve particular problems. And in my own research, I study brains\nto bring these solutions, the best that biology\nhas to offer, to computers. So consider the dragonfly brain. It has only on the order\nof one million neurons. Now, it's still not easy to unravel\na circuit of even one million neurons. But given the choice between trying to tease apart\nthe one-million-neuron brain versus the 86-billion-neuron brain, which would you choose to try first? (Laughter) When studying these smaller insect brains, the immediate goal\nis not human intelligence. We study these brains\nfor what the insects do well. And in the case of the dragonfly,\nthat's interception. So when dragonflies are hunting, they do more than just fly\nstraight at the prey. They fly in such a way\nthat they will intercept it. They aim for where\nthe prey is going to be. Much like a soccer player,\nrunning to intercept a pass. To do this correctly, dragonflies need to perform what is known\nas a coordinate transformation, going from the eye’s frame of reference,\nor what the dragonfly sees, to the body's frame of reference, or how the dragonfly needs\nto turn its body to intercept. Coordinate transformations\nare a basic calculation that animals need to perform\nto interact with the world. We do them instinctively\nevery time we reach for something. When I reach for an object\nstraight in front of me, my arm takes a very different trajectory\nthan if I turn my head, look at that same object\nwhen it is off to one side and reach for it there. In both cases, my eyes see\nthe same image of that object, but my brain is sending my arm\non a very different trajectory based on the position of my neck. And dragonflies are fast. This means they calculate fast. The latency, or the time it takes\nfor a dragonfly to respond once it sees the prey turn, is about 50 milliseconds. This latency is remarkable. For one thing, it's only half\nthe time of a human eye blink. But for another thing, it suggests that dragonflies\ncapture how to intercept in only relatively or surprisingly\nfew computational steps. So in the brain, a computational step is a single neuron or a layer of neurons working in parallel. It takes a single neuron\nabout 10 milliseconds to add up all its inputs and respond. The 50-millisecond response time means that once the dragonfly\nsees its prey turn, there's only time for maybe four\nof these computational steps or four layers of neurons,\nworking in sequence, one after the other, to calculate how\nthe dragonfly needs to turn. In other words, if I want to study how the dragonfly does\ncoordinate transformations, the neural circuit\nthat I need to understand, the neural circuit that I need to study, can have at most four layers of neurons. Each layer may have many neurons, but this is a small neural circuit. Small enough that we can identify it and study it with the tools\nthat are available today. And this is what I'm trying to do. I have built a model of what I believe\nis the neural circuit that calculates how\nthe dragonfly should turn. And here is the cool result. In the model, dragonflies do coordinate transformations\nin only one computational step, one layer of neurons. This is something\nwe can test and understand. In a computer simulation, I can predict the activities\nof individual neurons while the dragonfly is hunting. For example, here I am predicting\nthe action potentials, or the spikes, that are fired by one of these neurons when the dragonfly sees the prey move. To test the model, my collaborators and I are now comparing\nthese predicted neural responses with responses of neurons\nrecorded in living dragonfly brains. These are ongoing experiments in which we put living dragonflies\nin virtual reality. (Laughter) Now, it's not practical to put\nVR goggles on a dragonfly. So instead, we show movies\nof moving targets to the dragonfly, while an electrode records activity\npatterns of individual neurons in the brain. Yeah, he likes the movies. If the responses\nthat we record in the brain match those predicted by the model, we will have identified\nwhich neurons are responsible for coordinate transformations. The next step will be\nto understand the specifics of how these neurons work together\nto do the calculation. But this is how we begin to understand\nhow brains do basic or primitive calculations. Calculations that I regard as building\nblocks for more complex functions, not only for interception\nbut also for cognition. The way that these neurons compute\nmay be different from anything that exists on a computer today. And the goal of this work\nis to do more than just write code that replicates the activity\npatterns of neurons. We aim to build a computer chip that not only does the same things\nas biological brains but does them in the same way\nas biological brains. This could lead to drones\ndriven by computers the same size of the dragonfly's brain that captures some targets\nand avoid others. Personally, I'm hoping\nfor a small army of these to defend my backyard\nfrom mosquitoes in the summer. (Laughter) The GPS on your phone could be replaced\nby a new navigation device based on dung beetles or ants that could guide you to the straight\nor the easy path home. And what would the power requirements\nof these devices be like? As small as it is -- Or, sorry -- as large as it is, the human brain is estimated\nto have the same power requirements as a 20-watt light bulb. Imagine if all brain-inspired computers had the same extremely\nlow-power requirements. Your smartphone or your smartwatch\nprobably needs charging every day. Your new brain-inspired device might only\nneed charging every few months, or maybe even every few years. The famous physicist,\nRichard Feynman, once said, \"What I cannot create,\nI do not understand.\" What I see in insect nervous systems is an opportunity to understand brains through the creation of computers\nthat work as brains do. And creation of these computers\nwill not just be for knowledge. There's potential for real impact\non your devices, your vehicles, maybe even artificial intelligences. So next time you see an insect, consider that these tiny brains\ncan lead to remarkable computers. And think of the potential\nthat they offer us for the future. Thank you.

Three fearsome figures haunted his dreams: a massive, writhing shadow; a shambling, rotting corpse; and worst of all, \na monstrous beast with a deadly bite. Night after night, the creatures\nbesieged the king. And although their true forms\nwere unknown to him, he could tell they were related \nto Asgard’s most persistent problem: Loki. Despite having settled down\nwith his wife and sons, Loki had been sneaking off to visit \nthe giantess Angrboda. And when the king learned this affair\nhad produced three children, he was filled with unease. Odin summoned Thor and Tyr, \ntwo of his bravest warriors, to travel to Jotunheim to capture \nLoki’s secret children. Upon arriving at Angrboda’s home, the pair were immediately accosted\nby Loki's first child, a serpent named Jörmungandr. The God of Thunder dodged \nthe snake’s venom and swiftly bound him to a pine tree. The second child, Hel, appeared as \na glowing young woman from the right and a moldering corpse from the left. Her flesh flaked onto the ground \nas she silently submitted to her captors. Finally, the third child leapt at Tyr. The small wolf was fierce but harmless. Tyr playfully cuffed its claws \nand stowed the cub in his pocket. Back in Asgard, the warriors\npresented their prisoners and fearful recognition\nseized Odin's heart. Though these three were meager reflections\nof his dark dreams, the king was determined to dispose \nof them before his visions came true. First, he banished Jörmungandr \nto the sea at the edge of the world. Then he sent Hel deep below the earth\nto join her fellow corpses. But the wolf, named Fenrir, \npresented a challenge. He’d already grown strong\nenough to threaten the gods, so Odin took a more patient approach. For months, he supervised the creature,\nwatching Fenrir grow from a cub to a wolf to a beast \nwho spoke with the voice of a God. Tyr visited frequently and found Fenrir\nto be strong and clever. But as their bond deepened,\nOdin's fear only grew. One day, Odin forged his heaviest chains and hauled them to Fenrir \nwith a challenge. He would bind the wolf\nto test his growing strength. Fenrir eagerly accepted the challenge \nand splintered the metal like old wood. Odin returned to the forge, crafting\nshackles that no man could lift alone. These sturdy chains gave Fenrir pause. But with an encouraging wink from Tyr,\nhe accepted the challenge. The beast strained for a moment \nand then shattered his restraints into a thousand pieces. Desperate, Odin sought help \nfrom the most skilled makers of all: the Dwarves. Rather than metal, they sought \nthe rarest ingredients; from feline footsteps and fish breath to the sinews of mountains \nand mighty bears. With these, the Dwarves crafted Gleipnir, an unbreakable chain in the guise \nof fine thread. When Odin challenged Fenrir a third time, \nthe wolf laughed. But as he examined the thread \nmore closely, Fenrir sensed Odin’s trickery \nand began to feel some fear himself. Fenrir struck a deal. He would accept the challenge, but only if a god kept their hand \nin his mouth throughout. With a heavy heart, Tyr volunteered. The gods bound the wolf and as he strained\nGleipnir only grew tighter. Fenrir felt the agony of betrayal— not only from Odin,\nbut from his reluctant friend. With a howl of fury, \nhe bit through Tyr’s wrist and vowed to destroy Odin \nfor tricking him. Watching his nightmare come to life, Odin thrust Tyr’s blade\nbetween Fenrir jaws, releasing a torrent of saliva \nthat became a furious river. While the beast was not dead, \nhe was bound, and Odin celebrated his victory over fate. But in truth, his actions had\nonly sealed his doom. Beneath the waves, \nJörmungandr grew to encircle the world. Hel rose to rule the dead\nas queen of the Underworld. And every day, Fenrir strained \na little more against his chains, inching ever closer to his bloody revenge."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Odin first encountered Loki’s secret children:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In Asgard"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In his dreams"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In his nightmares"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In Jotunheim"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these is NOT a form that Loki’s children took:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Serpeant"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wolf"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Corpse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dragon"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "While he was imprisoned at Asgard, Fenrir:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Plotted against Odin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Built a friendship with Tyr"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tried to escape"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Built a friendship with Odin"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who made Gleipnir?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dwarves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Giants"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gods"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Men"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When he was bound, Fenrir formed what natural formation:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A mountain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A forge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A river"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A cave"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 82, "lesson": 8, "title": "3 rules for better work-life balance - Ashley Whillans", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/3-rules-for-better-work-life-balance-ashley-whillans", "transcript": {"en": "Transcriber: Leslie Gauthier For so many of us, myself included, our days feel filled\nwith a million small interruptions. And this is true even of our days off. Maybe you've taken a call at the beach, texted your boss from the grocery store or emailed a colleague\nwhile on a picnic with your family. We’ve convinced ourselves\nthat these behaviors are no big deal. It's just one email. But there's a real cost\nto these interruptions, and there are smart strategies\nwe can all take to better protect our time. (Music) [The Way We Work] These moments seem so small at the time, and yet research suggests\nthey add up to a tremendous loss. The constant creep of work\ninto our personal lives can increase our stress and undermine our happiness. So just what is the cost? In one study, researchers recruited parents  who were\nvisiting a science museum with their kids. Some parents were told to check\ntheir phone as much as possible; others were told to check their phone\nas little as possible. After the visit, parents who used their phones reported that the experience\nwas significantly less meaningful. They also felt much lonelier. In another study, tourists who were asked\nto have their phones out while visiting an iconic church remembered fewer details a week later. And in my research, employees who were paid \nfor their performance spent increasingly less time interacting\nwith friends and family, and more and more time\ninteracting with colleagues and clients. These constant interruptions\ncome at a cost to organizations, too. Companies lose 32 days of productivity\neach year to employee depression, which is often caused by the stress\nand burnout of our always-on culture. Despite knowing better, I, too, have found myself focusing\non “urgent work distractions” over important life moments. Most recently,\nI found myself texting a client while in the middle\nof my first child’s first ultrasound ... happy client, guilty mom-to-be. When you add up all of these moments, the sum total is a life\nshortchanged on meaning, joy, connection and even memory. As we remake our models of work\nin the wake of the pandemic, now is our opportunity to create\na new culture that respects time. And the way to make this really big change is through small steps\nthat we can take right now. The first step that we need to take\nis to reframe rest. Reflect for a moment about what you think\nabout when you hear the word “rest.” Sounds amazing, right? But in my mind, I immediately worry\nabout not being productive enough or letting down my colleagues. When we do have time off, we need to find ways in which\nwe can enjoy the present moment and savor the leisure time\nthat we have available, as opposed to seeing it\nas an unproductive barrier to our work. One specific strategy we can take is to treat our upcoming\nweekend like a vacation. On Friday afternoon, jot down how you would act and behave\nas if you were on a holiday. Maybe you and your partner\nwill buy a bottle of wine and watch online clips\nof the Eiffel Tower. Maybe you’ll visit a local café and listen to some live music. Or maybe you'll go for a long\nwalk in the middle of the day with no phone and no agenda. The plan doesn't have to be\nexpensive or extravagant. Another strategy you can take\nis to create clear boundaries for your time off. Instead of saying, \"I'm out of the office. Feel free to Slack me whenever,” say, \"I'll be offline. Call me only if it's urgent.\" To uphold these personal goals, work together as a team. Set team goals for personal time. Do it publicly, collect data and hold each other accountable. These goals could sound like, “I will not check email\nbetween 6:00 and 8:00pm;” “I will have dinner with my family\nfour nights a week;” or \"I will go for a jog midday.\" Check in on your team’s progress and see how everyone's doing. If you or your teammates are unsuccessful, work together to help\naccomplish personal goals. Lastly, you can negotiate for more time to prevent work from creeping\ninto your personal life. In business school, I teach\nstudents to negotiate for salary but realize I spoke almost nothing\nabout negotiating for more time. What does this look like in practice? You can ask for more time\non adjustable deadlines at work. If your client asks\nfor a deliverable Monday morning, ask for an extension\nuntil Tuesday afternoon so you don’t find yourself working\non your well-deserved weekend. And don't worry too much about reputation. Quality truly is the metric\nthat matters most. In my data, employees who proactively\nasked for more time reported lower levels\nof stress and burnout, and were seen as more committed\nand professional by their colleagues. These are small but powerful changes\nto not only reframe rest, but to reclaim it. Once you discover the profound impact\nthat these changes can have, you’ll feel empowered to demand\nthat others respect and accommodate your approach to time. Maybe they’ll even feel inspired to piece together the fractured moments\nof their lives, too."}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 82, "lesson": 9, "title": "How can we support the emotional well-being of teachers? - Sydney Jensen", "category": "Teaching & Education", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-can-we-support-the-emotional-well-being-of-teachers-sydney-jensen", "transcript": {"en": "Like many teachers, every year on the first day of school, I lead a sort of icebreaker activity\nwith my students. I teach at Lincoln High School\nin Lincoln, Nebraska, and we are one of the oldest\nand most diverse high schools in our state. Also, to our knowledge, we're the only high school in the world\nwhose mascot is the Links. Like, a chain. (Laughter) And with that being our mascot, we have a statue out front of our building of four links connected like a chain. And each link means something. Our links stand for tradition, excellence, unity and diversity. So on the first day of school, I teach my new ninth-graders\nabout the meaning behind those links, and I give them each a slip of paper. On that paper, I ask them\nto write something about themselves. It can be something that they love, something that they hope for -- anything that describes their identity. And then I go around\nthe room with a stapler, and I staple each of those slips together to make a chain. And we hang that chain up in our classroom\nas a decoration, sure, but also as a reminder\nthat we are all connected. We are all links. So what happens when one\nof those links feels weak? And what happens when that weakness is in the person holding the stapler? The person who's supposed\nto make those connections. The teacher. As teachers, we work every day to provide support socially,\nemotionally and academically to our students who come to us\nwith diverse and tough circumstances. Like most teachers, I have students who go home every day, and they sit around the kitchen table while one or both parents makes a healthy,\nwell-rounded meal for them. They spend suppertime summarizing\nthe story they read in ninth-grade English that day, or explaining how Newton's\nlaws of motion work. But I also have students\nwho go to the homeless shelter or to the group home. They go to the car that their family\nis sleeping in right now. They come to school with trauma, and when I go home every day,\nthat goes home with me. And see, that's the hard part\nabout teaching. It's not the grading,\nthe lesson-planning, the meetings, though sure, those things do occupy\na great deal of teachers' time and energy. The tough part about teaching is all the things\nyou can't control for your kids, all the things you can't change for them\nonce they walk out your door. And so I wonder\nif it's always been this way. I think back to my undergraduate training\nat the University of Georgia, where we were taught\nin our methods classes that the concept\nof good teaching has changed. We're not developing learners who are going to go out into a workforce where they'll stand\non a line in a factory. Rather, we're sending our kids\nout into a workforce where they need to be able to communicate, collaborate and problem-solve. And that has caused\nteacher-student relationships to morph into something stronger than the giver of content\nand the receiver of knowledge. Lectures and sitting in silent rows\njust doesn't cut it anymore. We have to be able to build relationships\nwith and among our students to help them feel connected in a world that depends on it. I think back to my second year teaching. I had a student who I'll call \"David.\" And I remember feeling like\nI'd done a pretty good job at teaching that year: \"Hey, I ain't no first-year teacher. I know what I'm doing.\" And it was on the last day of school, I told David to have a great summer. And I watched him walk down the hall, and I thought to myself, I don't even know\nwhat his voice sounds like. And that's when I realized\nI wasn't doing it right. So I changed almost everything\nabout my teaching. I built in plenty of opportunities\nfor my students to talk to me and to talk to each other, to share their writing\nand to verbalize their learning. And it was through those conversations\nI began not only to know their voice but to know their pain. I had David in class again that next year, and I learned that his father\nwas undocumented and had been deported. He started acting out in school because all he wanted\nwas for his family to be together again. In so many ways, I felt his pain. And I needed someone to listen, somebody to provide support for me so that I could support him in this thing\nthat I could not even comprehend. And we recognize that need for police officers who've witnessed\na gruesome crime scene and nurses who have lost a patient. But when it comes\nto teaching professionals, that urgency is lagging. I believe it's paramount that students and teachers, administrators, paraprofessionals\nand all other support staff have convenient and affordable access\nto mental wellness supports. When we are constantly serving others, often between 25\nand 125 students each day, our emotional piggy banks\nare constantly being drawn upon. After a while, it can become so depleted, that we just can't bear it anymore. They call it \"secondary trauma\"\nand \"compassion fatigue,\" the concept that we absorb the traumas\nour students share with us each day. And after a while, our souls become weighed down\nby the heaviness of it all. The Buffett Institute\nat the University of Nebraska recently found that most teachers -- 86 percent across\nearly childhood settings -- experienced some depressive symptoms\nduring the prior week. They found that approximately one in 10 reported clinically significant\ndepressive symptoms. My interactions with colleagues\nand my own experiences make me feel like\nthis is a universal struggle across all grade levels. So what are we missing? What are we allowing to break the chain\nand how do we repair it? In my career, I've experienced the death\nby suicide of two students and one amazing teacher who loved his kids; countless students\nexperiencing homelessness; and kids entering and exiting\nthe justice system. When these events happen, protocol is to say, \"If you need\nsomeone to talk to, then ...\" And I say that's not enough. I am so lucky. I work in an amazing school\nwith great leadership. I serve a large district with so many healthy partnerships\nwith community agencies. They have provided steadily\nincreasing numbers of school counselors and therapists and support staff to help our students. They even provide staff members\nwith access to free counseling as part of our employment plan. But many small districts\nand even some large ones simply cannot foot the bill without aid. (Exhales) Not only does every school need\nsocial and emotional support staff, trained professionals who can navigate\nthe needs of the building -- not just the students,\nnot just the teachers, but both -- we also need these trained professionals to intentionally seek out\nthose closest to the trauma and check in with them. Many schools are doing what they can to fill in the gaps, starting with acknowledging\nthat the work that we do is downright hard. Another school in Lincoln,\nSchoo Middle School, has what they call \"Wellness Wednesdays.\" They invite in community yoga teachers, they sponsor walks around\nthe neighborhood during lunch and organize social events that are all meant\nto bring people together. Zachary Elementary School\nin Zachary, Louisiana, has something they call\na \"Midweek Meetup,\" where they invite teachers to share lunch and to talk about the things\nthat are going well and the things that are weighing\nheavy on their hearts. These schools are making space\nfor conversations that matter. Finally, my friend\nand colleague Jen Highstreet takes five minutes out of each day to write an encouraging\nnote to a colleague, letting them know\nthat she sees their hard work and the heart that they share with others. She knows that those five minutes can have an invaluable\nand powerful ripple effect across our school. The chain that hangs in my classroom\nis more than just a decoration. Those links hang over our heads for the entire four years\nthat our students walk our halls. And every year, I have seniors come back\nto my classroom, room 340, and they can still point out\nwhere their link hangs. They remember what they wrote on it. They feel connected and supported. And they have hope. Isn't that what we all need? Somebody to reach out\nand make sure that we're OK. To check in with us and remind us that we are a link. Every now and then,\nwe all just need a little help holding the stapler. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Snarling winds. \nConsuming downpours. Okeechobee, the disastrous hurricane \nof 1928, tore through the North Atlantic basin,\nlaying waste to entire communities. In Eatonville, Florida, \nthe storm forced many to flee. But for Janie Crawford, \nit inspired an unexpected homecoming. Janie’s return begins \n“Their Eyes Were Watching God,” Zora Neale Hurston’s acclaimed novel about a Black woman’s quest \nfor love and agency in a time that sought to deprive \nher of both. When Janie arrives back in Eatonville,\nher arrival is shrouded in mystery. Her neighbors and friends are quick\nto gossip about her reappearance, her finances, and most importantly, \nthe whereabouts of her missing husband. But only Janie’s friend Pheoby\ngets to hear the whole story. Over the course of a conversation \nthat spans most of the novel, Hurston untangles Janie’s life story; from her complicated childhood \nand her life in Eatonville, to her scandalous departure \nand the shocking events that followed. The specifics of Janie’s story\nare often larger than life, but many of the book’s details reflect \nthe incredible experiences of its author. Zora Neale Hurston was\nraised in Eatonville, one of the first planned and incorporated\nall-Black communities in America. Like Janie, she also left\nEatonville abruptly, traveling first to Jacksonville and DC,\nbefore eventually moving further north. In New York City, \nHurston studied anthropology and became a renowned author \nin the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural, literary and artistic movement\nthat’s still considered a golden era of Black artistry and creativity. Here, her work garnered enough support \nto fund research trips through the South, where she collected stories and folktales\nfrom Black Americans. By 1937, her fieldwork had taken\nher all the way to Haiti, where she wrote most \nof “Their Eyes Were Watching God.” Hurston drew on all these experiences\nfor the novel, incorporating folkloric elements alongside\nher own family and romantic history to bring readers into the intimate spaces \nof Black southern life. She uses regional phrases and sayings to capture the dialect \nof her Floridian characters. And the novel’s omniscient \nthird-person narration allows Hurston to unleash \nher poetic prose on everything from birdsong, architecture, and fashion, to her characters’ deepest feelings \nand motivations. Perhaps more than any specific details, Hurston’s experiences of being \na Black woman in America at this time are more evident in the novel’s themes. Over the course of one long evening, Janie and Pheoby discuss the nature of\nfamily, marriage, spirituality and more. But their conversation always comes back\nto Janie’s truest desire: to live honestly \nand be truly loved in return. As a teenager, Janie resents \nan arranged marriage, despite the safety it offers her \nand the wishes of her loving grandmother. When her family becomes well-respected \nin Eatonville, she struggles with the\njudgmental eyes of strangers and a husband who wants her \nto be something she’s not. Throughout her life, Janie frequently\nfeels she’s at the whim of natural and spiritual forces that can shift the course of her existence\nwithout warning. And when she finally does find true love, these unknowable powers \ncontinue to act on her, threatening to destroy the life\nshe's so painstakingly built. The story takes place during a time where\nwomen had little to no agency, and Janie’s life is full \nof complicated characters who demand different kinds \nof love and submission. But despite the loneliness \nof her situation, Janie navigates these trials \nwith defiance and curiosity. Her questions and commentary \npush back in subtle, clever ways. And as the reader follows Janie’s journey\nfrom childhood to middle age, her confidence becomes infectious. Just like Hurston, Janie defies \nthe restrictive expectations for a woman in her time. Early in the novel, Hurston writes that “there are years that ask questions\nand years that answer,” suggesting that life can only truly \nbe understood by living it. But through her empathetic storytelling, Hurston invites us into Janie’s life, \nher life, and the lives of so many other women."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who is the main character in the novel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tea Cake"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Janie"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pheoby"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Jody"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Where is Zora Neale Hurston from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Orlando, FL "}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tampa, FL"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Miami Beach, FL"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Eatonville, FL"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "______ is the name of the literary and cultural movement that the video mentions?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the Harlem Renaissance"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the Black Arts Movement"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Enlightenment"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Roaring Twenties"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who is main character talking to at the beginning and end of the novel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pheoby"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nanny"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Logan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sam"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are the two things that people around the main character demand?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "love and prosperity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "love and joy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "love and submission"}, {"label": "D", "text": "love and boldness"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

The Lakotas had reached the Black Hills, the most sacred place and most coveted\nbuffalo hunting grounds in the western plains. Located in what is now South Dakota, \ncontrol of the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, marked the Lakotas as the dominant power\nin the American West. Just a few decades before, they were vying\nfor power in the eastern woodlands— and losing. One of seven nations, \nor seven council fires, that made up the Sioux Alliance, the Lakotas had lived in the forests\nand wetlands between the Great Lakes \nand the Missouri Valley for centuries. In the 1600s, European colonizers\ndestabilized this region. While some tribes profited by trading\nfurs with new France, the Lakotas lived just out of range\nof the best trade opportunities. So in the early 1700s,\nthey turned their attention west. The western plains were much less fertile\nand abundant than the Lakotas’ homelands. The only easy access to food and water\nwas immediately alongside the rivers— land Arikaras had already claimed. To compete, the Lakotas became \nskilled buffalo hunters and warriors on horseback. They conquered the farming Arikaras, forcing them to pay tributes\nof maize and squash. When the Spanish arrived expecting\nto find lucrative trading grounds, they had to pay tolls \nto the Lakotas instead. In 1804, a new spectacle came floating\nup the Missouri River: Merriwether Lewis and William Clark. Lakota chief Black Buffalo refused to let\nthem pass until they paid a hefty tribute. In spite of this rocky start, the expedition marked the beginning\nof a close trade alliance between the Lakotas and the United States. Lakota men hunted buffalo, while women\nprocessed the hides into robes for trade. The US government supplied guns,\nammunition, and other goods, even providing Lakotas with smallpox\nvaccines that protected them from the deadly epidemics that ravaged\nother Native American nations. On paper, the United States had acquired\nthe Lakotas’ lands from France in the Louisiana Purchase. But the Lakotas would not cede their lands because of an agreement \nbetween two foreign powers. Though there were 15,000 Lakotas\nand 23 million Americans, the bulk of US population and military\nmight was concentrated on the east coast. Just getting an army to Lakota territory\npresented a huge expense, and once there they would face \nformidable warriors with deep local knowledge and alliances. To avoid a war it couldn’t afford \nand wouldn’t win, the US government attempted to appease \nthe Lakotas, paying steep tributes of ammunition \nand rations demanded by Lakota leaders. So while almost all the Native Americans\nin North America were being forced off their lands \nand onto reservations, the Lakota Empire was still expanding. By 1850, they controlled \nsome 500,000 square kilometers. They were spread thinly\nacross this vast area, moving their villages \nin pursuit of Buffalo. Though there was no central authority, the leaders of bands, or oyates, \ncame together at annual Sun Dances to strategize and coordinate complex\ndiplomatic operations. Lasting a few weeks each summer, Sun Dances were spiritual ceremonies \nthat reaffirmed communal ties, appeased Wakan Tanka, the Great Spirit,\nand kept the world in balance. Starting in 1849, the California gold rush\nbrought hordes of white settlers west, encroaching on Lakota territory\nand disturbing the buffalo herds. Lakota leaders correctly interpreted\nthis migration as a signal that the US no longer intended \nto respect their claim to the land. In retaliation, they attacked wagon trains\nand government offices. As the conflict grew, Chief Red Cloud\nnegotiated in Washington DC. While back in Lakota territory, chiefs \nSitting Bull, Crazy Horse, and others prepared for battle. They mobilized their Cheyenne \nand Arapaho allies and almost all the other Sioux nations \nagainst the US. In 1876, exactly 100 years after\nthe Lakotas’ arrival, gold prospectors occupied \nthe sacred Black Hills. For many Lakotas, \nthis was the final straw. Following a vision by Sitting Bull, \nCrazy Horse led Lakota forces to decisively defeat the Americans \nin the Battle of the Little Bighorn. After this victory, the Lakotas\nfaced an even graver threat: wagon travel and railroad construction\nhad decimated buffalo populations, and they faced starvation. To survive, they moved on to reservations, where the authorities murdered \nSitting Bull and Crazy Horse and attempted to dismantle their culture, \nprohibiting the Sun Dance on reservations. The Lakotas started a protest movement\ncalled the Ghost Dance. Alarmed by this resistance, in 1890,\nthe US Army massacred hundreds of Lakotas, many of them women and children,\nat Wounded Knee Creek. Today, Lakotas continue to fight \nfor their culture and their land. In 2016, they drew supporters worldwide\nto protest construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline \nthrough their reservation, continuing a long history of resistance to a government\nknown for breaking its promises."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who among these is a Lakota leader?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tecumseh"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Little Crow"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Black Buffalo"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Geronimo"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many square kilometres did the Lakota empire cover at its height?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "500,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "865,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "350,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "950,000"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which two Native nations were the most important allies of the Lakotas?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Crows and Shoshones"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cherokees and Creeks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cheyennes and Arapahos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pawnees and Omahas"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "In which year did the Battle of the Little Bighorn take place?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1890"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1776"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1876"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1881"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes, all expenses paid. But my tiger mother said, \"No.\" My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness: a safe and well-paid job. It is not important if I like the job or not. But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. That is me playing my imaginary piano. An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics, so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. But no adults liked the idea. No adults believed I was serious. Only my friends supported me, but they were kids, just as powerless as I was. So at age 15, I knew I was too old to be trained. My dream would never come true. I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for. But that's so unfair. So I was determined to find another calling. Nobody around to teach me? Fine. I turned to books. I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.[\"Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei\"] I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.[\"Jane Eyre\"] And I learned to be efficient from this book.[\"Cheaper by the Dozen\"] And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these. [\"Complete Works of Sanmao\" (aka Echo Chan)] [\"Lessons From History\" by Nan Huaijin] I came to the U.S. in 1995, so which books did I read here first? Books banned in China, of course. \"The Good Earth\" is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. The Bible is interesting, but strange. (Laughter) That's a topic for a different day. But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany: \"You shall honor your father and mother.\" \"Honor,\" I said. \"That's so different, and better, than obey.\" So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. It offers many insights. For example, I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. It had never occurred to me, China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. A map actually carries somebody's view. Comparative reading actually is nothing new. It's a standard practice in the academic world. There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. So I thought, well, if comparative reading works for research, why not do it in daily life too? So I started reading books in pairs. So they can be about people -- [\"Benjamin Franklin\" by Walter Isaacson][\"John Adams\" by David McCullough] -- who are involved in the same event, or friends with shared experiences. [\"Personal History\" by Katharine Graham][\"The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life,\" by Alice Schroeder] I also compare the same stories in different genres -- (Laughter) [Holy Bible: King James Version][\"Lamb\" by Chrisopher Moore] -- or similar stories from different cultures, as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.[\"The Power of Myth\" by Joseph Campbell] For example, both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. For the Christ, the temptations are economic, political and spiritual. For the Buddha, they are all psychological: lust, fear and social duty -- interesting. So if you know a foreign language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages. [\"The Way of Chuang Tzu\" Thomas Merton][\"Tao: The Watercourse Way\" Alan Watts] Instead of lost in translation, I found there is much to gain. For example, it's through translation that I realized \"happiness\" in Chinese literally means \"fast joy.\" Huh! \"Bride\" in Chinese literally means \"new mother.\" Uh-oh. (Laughter) Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from, where passion comes from, where happiness comes from. Even a shattered dream can do that for you. So because of books, I'm here today, happy, living again with a purpose and a clarity, most of the time. So may books be always with you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you.

In the centuries that followed, many more dictionaries were written \nby individual authors who chose what to include or exclude. They not only defined words, they openly \nshowcased their creators’ opinions— like Ambrose Bierce’s definition\nof “dictionary” and Samuel Johnson’s definition\nof “lexicographer.” After their authors deaths, many of these\ndictionaries quickly became outdated. But one 19th century dictionary\nhad a different fate. In 1828, American lawyer and author\nNoah Webster published “An American Dictionary of the \nEnglish Language” with a lofty goal: to give the United States its own version\nof the English language. He believed that as a new nation, the United States needed its own distinct\nversion of English to assert its independence from Britain. In his dictionary, Webster sought \nto describe and officialize the way Americans spoke. Most dictionaries in Webster’s time \nwere prescriptive: they dictated how words should be used, rather than documenting the way people \nactually used language in daily life. When Webster broke this convention and \nincluded slang words in his dictionary, critics accused him of polluting\nthe English language. But he argued that these words captured\nlocal variations of language— a vital part of what made\nAmerican English unique. He also believed spelling rules\nwere unnecessarily complex, and that we should write the way\nwe speak as much as possible. Still, Webster’s own opinions influenced\nthe words he included and the way he defined them. He excluded slang words \nfrom Black communities because he didn’t consider them proper. And when he defined “woman,” he added that “women are soft, \nmild, pitiful, and flexible.” By the time of his death, \nNoah Webster was a household name. Seeing a lucrative business opportunity, brothers George and Charles Merriam bought\nthe rights to Webster’s Dictionary. Together with Webster’s son-in-law, \nthe Merriams made a new, revised edition. It was the beginning \nof the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. Today, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary\nbegins to address a contradiction in Webster’s goal: he wanted to represent an entire nation, but he based his work on just one person’s\nopinion: his own. Since Webster’s death, each new edition\nof the dictionary has been curated by a group of language experts rather\nthan by a single authority. The current criteria for\nincluding a word in the dictionary are that it has “widespread,\nsustained, and meaningful use.” This clearly includes profanities, which were sometimes excluded \nfrom dictionaries in the past. Racial slurs also meet\nthe criteria for inclusion, but some argue that including\nthem might legitimize them. Dictionaries don’t just add new words— they also redefine old words to reflect\nchanging attitudes and usage. One 1736 dictionary defined “wife”\nas “a married woman whose will, in the judgment of the law, is subject\nto the will of her husband: for which reason a wife is\nsaid to have no will.” Today, “wife” is defined simply as \n“a female partner in a marriage.” In 2019, Merriam-Webster’s word\nof the year was “they.” The word has been in regular\nuse for centuries, but has only recently gained a new\nrecognized meaning, as a pronoun for one person whose \ngender identity is nonbinary. The question of which words belong \nin the dictionary impacts all of us— when our words and definitions \nare represented, they’re affirmed; if not, they— and we— are minimized. Today, lexicographers have expanded \nword sourcing to include the dictionary’s users:\ntracking which words are most searched, and adding them to the dictionary. So, who decides what’s in the dictionary? More than ever before the answer is: \nwe do. All of us shape language every day. When we collectively embrace one word \nor redefine another, eventually, those words and meanings\nare reflected in our dictionaries."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who is in charge of making dictionaries?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Teachers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lexicographers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Politicians"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Writers"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When is a dictionary finished being written?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Never"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Only when a rival dictionary is published"}, {"label": "C", "text": "On December 31"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Until their next edition"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How many words does the English language have?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More than 20,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "More than 50,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "More than 200,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Almost 1,000,000"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Where was Samuel Johnson from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "France"}, {"label": "B", "text": "England"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "United States"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who invented language?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "God"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Phoenicians"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Humans"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Google"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which language doesn’t change?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A dead language"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Portuguese"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Baby talk"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mandarin"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But finding gold may have been easier \nthan transporting it back east. The only hope for avoiding \na grueling six month wagon journey was to travel the narrowest portion \nof the continent— the 48-kilometer Isthmus of Panama. By 1855, a railroad spanning the region\nsignificantly shortened to the trip, but unloading and reloading ships\nat each port cost time and money. To truly connect these two bodies of water\nshipping interests needed a canal— a continuous maritime passage\nthrough the isthmus. The first attempt at this colossal\nconstruction project was taken up in 1881 by French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps. De Lesseps had supervised construction\nof Egypt's Suez Canal, but his success made him overconfident. He insisted on digging the canal \nat sea level, even though it required boring \ndirectly through the Continental Divide mountain range. Futile excavation efforts were buried\nunder constant landslides. And since the diplomat had only \nvisited the site briefly during Panama’s dry season, his workers were unprepared for \ntorrential storms, venomous jungle fauna, and tropical diseases. After spending $287 million \nand losing a staggering 22,000 lives, the French abandoned the project. The United States had been considering\nbuilding a canal through Nicaragua, but at this point, the chance to succeed\nwhere France failed was tempting. Panamanian leaders were also eager \nto complete a canal which would bring their country\nbusiness and prestige. However, Panama was still a part\nof Colombia at the time, and the country was stalling negotiations\nwith the U.S. Sensing an opportunity, President Teddy Roosevelt \nwent straight to the Panamanians. With encouragement and military support \nfrom the U.S., Panama launched a coup in 1903. Within days, they became \nan independent nation and signed a treaty to begin \nconstruction of the canal. Just over a decade after the French left,\nthe Americans were ready to dig in— and they were determined to avoid\ntheir predecessor’s mistakes. Instead of cutting the mountain\ndown to sea level, they would raise the sea up the mountain. The plan was to build massive steel gates separating the canal into multiple\nchambers with different water levels. As a ship passed through each \nsuccessive gate would open, lowering the water level \nin the next chamber, while raising the ship \nand allowing it to move on. The design called for five \nof these so-called canal locks— three on the Atlantic side\nand two on the Pacific, raising traversing ships 26 meters \nabove sea level. Operating this lock system would require\na massive reservoir of water. And fortunately, the low-lying Chagres \nriver valley provided a natural solution. By building a dam across the gap \nwhere the river flowed out to sea, the entire valley could be flooded. At 32 meters high \nand over 800 meters wide, the Gatun Dam would be larger \nthan any built before. With this innovative plan, the Americans didn’t need to excavate\nthe entire mountain, but rather, just the pathway\nfor the canal itself. Still, the work was staggering. Even after progress made by the French,\nit took over nine years for 24,000 workers to blow up, shovel, \nand drill out the Culebra Cut— a roughly 14 kilometer passageway \nthrough the Continental Divide. The railway, now upgraded and rerouted\nto follow the canal, carted away over 76 million cubic meters\nof excavated rock to be used at the Gatun Dam site. Construction was only half the battle. Leading army officials struggled \nto maintain infrastructure and sanitation, but accidents and diseases took\nthe lives of 5,000 workers— mostly Black Caribbean migrants. Then, in the fall of 1913,\nthe moment finally came. A telegraph signal from President Woodrow\nWilson triggered a dike explosion, flooding the Culebra Cut and joining \nthe Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Today, nearly 14,000 vessels travel\nthrough the isthmus annually— each in under 12 hours. The canal remains Panama’s \nchief source of revenue; and since the country gained ownership\nof the passage in 1999, it has also become a source\nof national pride."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the only sea passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans before the canal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Strait of Magellan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Strait of Gibraltar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bering Strait"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the Continental Divide?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A massive canyon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The US-Canada border"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A tall mountain ridge"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What other location did the US consider for the canal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Costa Rica"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nicaragua"}, {"label": "C", "text": "El Salvador"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these was NOT one of the causes of worker deaths?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tropical diseases"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Venomous creatures"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Decompression sickness"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How did Wilson destroy the dike that finally opened the canal?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Triggered an explosion with a telegraph signal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hit it with a massive sledgehammer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Fired a cannon at it"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Each new contender was only slightly\ntaller than the one before, and architects were running out of ways\nto top their previous efforts. But in 2004 construction began\non a new building in Dubai, promising a revolutionary design \nthat would dwarf the competition. In 2009, the 828-meter Burj Khalifa \nwas complete, surpassing the previous \nrecord-holder by over 60%. So what innovations allowed \nfor such a huge leap in height? For most of architectural history,\nheavy building materials made it difficult for tall buildings \nto support their own weight. To compensate, taller structures had \nwider, thicker masonry at the base, making them substantially more expensive. The arrival of industrial steel \nin the early 20th century helped buildings shed weight, \nand stretch to new heights. But steel frames required intensive\nlabor to produce, often under poor working conditions. And when they were finished, these three dimensional grids took up huge\namounts of space inside buildings. Tall steel skyscrapers also had \nlarger, less dense surfaces, making them vulnerable to strong winds. Architects designed various \ncountermeasures to prevent swaying and structural damage, but to increase height further, engineers would have to completely rethink\nhow tall buildings were designed. Enter the father of modern skyscrapers:\nFazlur Rahman Khan. This Bangladeshi-American engineer\nbelieved tall structures should bear their weight where they were \nwidest and most stable— on the outside. He proposed swapping an internal grid \nof steel beams for a steel and concrete exoskeleton that would make buildings\nmore resilient to wind while using far less heavy materials. Khan developed this idea into what\nhe called tubular designs. These buildings had exterior steel frames\nthat were braced with concrete and connected to horizontal floor beams. Tubular frames proved superior\nat absorbing and transferring the force of wind to a building's\nfoundation. And since the exterior walls could\nbear the bulk of the load, internal supporting columns could\nbe removed to maximize space. Following the 1960s, tubular design\nbecame the industry standard. This new philosophy allowed \nfor the construction of taller, sturdier skyscrapers, including many of the record holders \nfor world’s tallest building. But planning the Burj Khalifa would\ntake one more innovation. In 2004, the late Fazlur Khan’s \nlongtime employers, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, completed \nthe Tower Palace III in South Korea. This building took Khan's exoskeleton\ndesign one step further, with a central column supported\nby three protruding wings. Each wing’s weight carries the other two, while the heavy concrete core acts \nas a support beam, that also houses the building’s elevators \nand mechanical infrastructure. This design, called the buttressed core, allowed the entire structure to work \nas a single load-bearing unit, supporting the building’s 73 stories. SOM was confident the buttressed core\ncould support a much taller building, and they were determined to see how high\nthey could go with their next project. As only the second building\nto use this design, the Burj Khalifa spans \nan unprecedented 163 floors. To battle the monumental \nvertical and lateral forces, the design strategically places \nthe strongest, load-bearing areas where the wind is also most powerful. Additionally, the Y-shaped layout \nwas specifically calibrated to minimize local wind forces. Every several floors, \none of the wings recedes slightly, forming a series of setbacks\nin a clockwise pattern. This spiral shape disperses air currents, transforming 240 kilometer per hour\nwinds into harmless gusts.

Many Athenians believed \nhe was a dangerous enemy of the state, accusing the philosopher\nof corrupting the youth and refusing to recognize their gods. However, Socrates wasn’t feared \nfor claiming to have all the answers, but rather, for asking too many questions. While he loathed formal lectures, the philosopher frequently\nengaged friends and strangers in lengthy conversations\nabout morality and society. These discussions weren’t debates,\nnor would Socrates offer explicit advice. In fact, the philosopher often claimed\nto know nothing at all, responding to his partner's answers\nonly with further questions. But through this process, \nSocrates probed their logic, revealing its flaws and helping both\nparties reach a more robust understanding. These insightful questions made Socrates\nbeloved by his followers. Two of his students, Plato and Xenophon,\nwere so inspired that they replicated their mentor’s \nprocess in fictional dialogues. These invented exchanges\nprovide perfect examples of what would come to be known \nas the Socratic Method. In one of these fabricated dialogues, Socrates is conversing with \na young man named Euthydemus, who is confident that he understands \nthe nature of justice and injustice. Socrates probes the student’s values\nby asking him to label actions such as lying and theft \nas just or unjust. Euthydemus confidently categorizes\nthem as injustices, but this only prompts another question: is it just for a general to deceive\nor pillage a hostile army? Euthydemus revises his assertion. He claims that these actions \nare just when done to enemies, and unjust when done to friends. But Socrates isn’t finished. He asks the young man to consider \na commander lying to his troops to boost their morale. Before long, Euthydemus is despondent. It seems that every answer\nleads to further problems, and perhaps he’s not quite sure\nwhat constitutes justice after all. In employing this\nquestion-oriented approach, Socrates described himself as a midwife, whose inquiries assist others\nin giving birth to their ideas. His method of questioning draws out an\nindividual’s unexamined assumptions, and then challenges those biases. It doesn't always provide\ndefinitive answers, but the method helps clarify the questions and eliminate contradictory \nor circular logic. And by following a line of inquiry \nwhere it logically leads, both the question asker and answerer\ncan end up in unexpected places. This technique isn’t limited \nby the conversation’s content, making it incredibly useful\nin numerous fields. During the Renaissance, the method was\nused to teach clinical medicine. Students proposed their rationale\nfor different diagnoses, while a doctor questioned their\nassumptions and moderated discussion. In this model, the method could even\nproduce conclusive results. This same approach was later used\nin other sciences, such as astronomy, botany, \nand mathematics. Following the Protestant Reformation, it was adapted to tackle abstract\nquestions of faith. In the 19th century, the method \nbecame an essential part of American legal education. Professors explored students’ \nunderstanding of judicial reasoning by challenging them with unforeseen\nhypothetical situations. This approach is still used today\nby the Supreme Court to imagine the unintended impacts \nof passing a law. The Socratic Method can be adapted \nto teach almost any topic that relies on critical reasoning, but its success depends on the teacher \nemploying it. An effective Socratic educator \nmust be well versed in their subject. Rather than bullying their students\nor showing off their superior intellect, they should be modest, genuinely curious, \nand affirming of every contribution. In this regard, Socrates himself may not have been \nthe most subtle Socratic teacher. Historians believe he was deeply critical\nof Athens’ particular brand of democracy, and known to pass those concerns\nonto his followers. These subversive beliefs were\ndistorted in public forums and thought to have inspired \ntwo of his pupils to treasonous ends. It was likely for these ideas\nSocrates was brought to trial, and eventually, \nsentenced to death.

In the city of Seville, devout Catholics are turning themselves \nin to the authorities. They’re confessing to heresy— failure to\nfollow the beliefs of the Catholic Church. But why? The Spanish Inquisition\nhas arrived in Seville. The Inquisition began in 1478, \nwhen Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree authorizing the Catholic monarchs, \nFerdinand and Isabella, to root out heresy\nin the Spanish kingdoms— a confederacy of semi-independent kingdoms in the area that would become\nthe modern country of Spain. Though the order came from the church,\nthe monarchs had requested it. When the Inquisition began, \nthe Spanish kingdoms were diverse both ethnically and religiously, with Jews, Muslims, and Christians living\nin the same regions. The Inquisition quickly turned\nits attention to ridding the region of people who were not\npart of the Catholic Church. It would last more than 350 years. On the ground, groups called tribunals ran\nthe Inquisition in each region. Roles on a tribunal could include an arresting constable, \na prosecuting attorney, inquisitors to question the accused,\nand a scribe. A “Grand Inquisitor,” a member of the \nclergy selected by the king and queen, almost always led a tribunal. The Inquisition marked its arrival in each\nnew place with an “Edict of Grace.” Typically lasting 40 days, the Edict of Grace promised mercy\nto those who confess to heresy. After that, the inquisitors persecuted\nsuspected heretics on the basis of anonymous accusations. So the confessors in Seville probably\ndidn’t see themselves as actual heretics— instead, they were hedging their bets\nby reporting themselves when the consequences were low, rather than risking \nimprisonment or torture if someone else accused them later on. They were right to worry: once the authorities arrested someone, \naccusations were often vague, so the accused didn’t know the reasons \nfor their arrest or the identity of their accuser. Victims were imprisoned \nfor months or even years. Once arrested, \ntheir property was confiscated, often leaving their families\non the street. Under these conditions, victims confessed\nto the most mundane forms of heresy— like hanging linen to dry on a Saturday. The Inquisition targeted different subsets\nof the population over time. In 1492, at the brutal Grand Inquisitor\nTomás de Torquemada’s urging, the monarchs issued a decree giving \nSpanish Jews four months to either convert to Christianity\nor leave the kingdom. Thousands were expelled \nand those who stayed risked persecution. Converts to Christianity,\nknown as conversos, weren’t even safe, because authorities suspected \nthem of practicing Judaism in secret. The hatred directed at conversos\nwas both religious and economic, as conversos made up a large portion\nof the upper middle class. The Inquisition eventually\nshifted its focus to the moriscos, converts to Christianity from Islam. In 1609, an edict passed forcing\nall moriscos to leave. An estimated 300,000 left. Those who remained became \nthe Inquisition’s next targets. The inquisitors announced the punishments\nof those found guilty of heresy in public gatherings called autos de fé,\nor acts of faith. Hundreds of people gathered to watch \nthe procession of sinners, mass, sermon, and finally the announcement\nof punishments. Most of the accused received punishments\nlike imprisonment, exile, or having to wear a sanbenito, \na garment that marked them as a sinner. The worst punishment \nwas “relaxado en persona”— a euphemism for burning at the stake. This punishment was relatively uncommon— reserved for unrepentant\nand relapsed heretics. Over 350 years after Queen Isabella\nstarted the Inquisition, her namesake, Queen Isabella II, \nformally ended it on July 15th, 1834. The Spanish kingdoms’ dependence \non the Catholic Church had isolated them while the rest of Europe\nexperienced the Enlightenment and embraced the separation \nof church and state. Historians still debate the number \nof people killed during the Inquisition. Some suggest over 30,000 \nbut most estimate between 1,000 and 2,000. The consequences of the Inquisition,\nhowever, reach far beyond fatalities. In some places, an estimated 1/3\nof prisoners were tortured. Hundreds of thousands of members \nof religious minorities were forced to leave their homes, and those who remained faced \ndiscrimination and economic hardship. Smaller inquisitions in Spanish \ncolonial territories in the Americas, especially Mexico,\ncarried their own tolls. Friends turned in friends, \nneighbors accused neighbors, and even family members reported\neach other of heresy.

But no matter what these AIs are doing,\nthe computer scientists who designed them likely don’t know exactly \nhow they’re doing it. This is because artificial intelligence \nis often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array \nof rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? There are many different ways \nto build self-teaching programs. But they all rely on the three \nbasic types of machine learning: unsupervised learning, supervised \nlearning, and reinforcement learning. To see these in action, let’s imagine researchers are trying\nto pull information from a set of medical data containing\nthousands of patient profiles. First up, unsupervised learning. This approach would be ideal\nfor analyzing all the profiles to find general similarities\nand useful patterns. Maybe certain patients have similar\ndisease presentations, or perhaps a treatment produces\nspecific sets of side effects. This broad pattern-seeking approach \ncan be used to identify similarities between patient profiles \nand find emerging patterns, all without human guidance. But let's imagine doctors are looking\nfor something more specific. These physicians want \nto create an algorithm for diagnosing a particular condition. They begin by collecting two sets of data— medical images and test results\nfrom both healthy patients and those diagnosed with the condition. Then, they input this data into a program designed to identify features\nshared by the sick patients but not the healthy patients. Based on how frequently \nit sees certain features, the program will assign values to those\nfeatures’ diagnostic significance, generating an algorithm \nfor diagnosing future patients. However, unlike unsupervised learning, doctors and computer scientists have \nan active role in what happens next. Doctors will make the final diagnosis and check the accuracy \nof the algorithm’s prediction. Then computer scientists can use\nthe updated datasets to adjust the program’s parameters \nand improve its accuracy. This hands-on approach is called\nsupervised learning. Now, let’s say these doctors want \nto design another algorithm to recommend treatment plans. Since these plans\nwill be implemented in stages, and they may change depending on each\nindividual's response to treatments, the doctors decide to use\nreinforcement learning. This program uses an iterative approach\nto gather feedback about which medications, dosages \nand treatments are most effective. Then, it compares that data \nagainst each patient’s profile to create their unique, optimal \ntreatment plan. As the treatments progress and the program\nreceives more feedback, it can constantly update \nthe plan for each patient. None of these three techniques are\ninherently smarter than any other. While some require more or less \nhuman intervention, they all have their own strengths\nand weaknesses which makes them best suited\nfor certain tasks. However, by using them together, researchers can build complex AI systems, where individual programs can \nsupervise and teach each other. For example, \nwhen our unsupervised learning program finds groups of patients that are similar, it could send that data to a connected \nsupervised learning program. That program could then incorporate \nthis information into its predictions. Or perhaps dozens of reinforcement\nlearning programs might simulate potential patient outcomes to collect feedback \nabout different treatment plans. There are numerous ways to create\nthese machine-learning systems, and perhaps the most promising models are those that mimic the relationship \nbetween neurons in the brain. These artificial neural networks can use\nmillions of connections to tackle difficult tasks like \nimage recognition, speech recognition, and even language translation. However, the more self-directed\nthese models become, the harder it is for computer scientists to determine how these self-taught \nalgorithms arrive at their solution. Researchers are already looking at ways \nto make machine learning more transparent. But as AI becomes more involved\nin our everyday lives, these enigmatic decisions have\nincreasingly large impacts on our work, health, and safety. So as machines continue learning \nto investigate, negotiate and communicate, we must also consider how to teach them \nto teach each other to operate ethically."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does supervised machine learning figure out what rules to follow to do a task?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The data scientist has to learn the rules and program them for the computer to follow"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The rules are learned by the computer on its own"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The rules are found by mathematical proof"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Supervised learning is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When the data scientist watches the AI as it works on a computer in the same room"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When the data scientist creates a set of rules for the AI to follow and reviews the AI as it works to make sure those rules are followed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When the data scientist knows the correct answer for classification tasks and uses them to let the AI learn how to classify new data points on its own"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Unsupervised learning is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When the AI run on a server in a different building"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A technique that requires a specific goal or positive outcome"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A set of techniques which allows the AI to find patterns in data without knowing in advance what to look for"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Reinforcement learning is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Often used to create a strategy to play games knowing only the goal"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A set of rules that are set up by researchers to reinforce their goal"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A technique that requires knowledge of the way humans play games"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT true?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Artificial Neural Networks mimic the connections between the human brain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Artificial neural networks have multiple layers"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Artificial neural networks can only be used to recognize faces"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 82, "lesson": 19, "title": "Can loud music damage your hearing? - Heather Malyuk", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-loud-music-damage-your-hearing-heather-malyuk", "transcript": {"en": "After a three-hour concert by her\nfavorite Norwegian metal band, Anja finds it difficult to hear \nher friend rave about the show. It sounds like he's speaking\nfrom across the room, and it’s tough to make out his muted voice\nover the ringing in her ears. By the next morning, \nthe effect has mostly worn off, but Anja still has questions. What caused the symptoms? \nIs her hearing going to fully recover? And can she still go to concerts\nwithout damaging her ears? To answer these questions, we first need to understand what sound is\nand how we hear it. Like a pebble creating ripples in water, sound is created when displaced molecules\nvibrate through space. While sound vibrations can travel\nthrough solids and liquids, our ears have evolved to process\nvibrations in the air. These waves of air pressure enter \nour ear canals and bounce off the eardrum. A trio of bones called the ossicular chain then carries those vibrations \ninto the cochlea, transforming waves of air pressure\ninto waves of cochlear fluid. Here, our perception of sound\nbegins to take form. The waves of fluid move\nthe basilar membrane, a tissue lined with tens of thousands\nof hair cells. The specific vibration of these hair cells\nand the stereocilia on top of each one determine the auditory signal \nour brain perceives. Unfortunately, these essential cells\nare also quite vulnerable. There are two properties of sound \nthat can damage these cells. The first is volume. The louder a sound is, the greater\nthe pressure of its vibrations. While the ear’s upper limits vary\nfrom person to person, close range exposure to sound\nexceeding 120 decibels can instantly bend or blow out hair cells,\nresulting in permanent hearing damage. The pressure of more powerful sounds \ncan even dislocate the ossicular chain or burst an eardrum. The other side of this equation \nis the sound’s duration. While dangerously loud sounds \ncan injure ears almost instantly, hair cells can also be damaged by exposure to lower sound pressure \nfor long periods. For example, hearing a hand dryer is safe \nfor the 20 seconds you’re using it. But if you listened \nfor 8 consecutive hours, this relatively low-pressure sound \nwould overwork the stereocilia and swell the hair cell’s \nsupporting tissue. Swollen hair cells are unable to vibrate \nwith the appropriate speed and accuracy, making hearing muffled. This kind of hearing loss is known\nas a temporary threshold shift, and many people will experience \nit at least once in their lifetime. In Anja’s case, \nthe loud sounds of the concert only took three hours\nto cause this condition. Fortunately, it's a temporary ailment\nthat usually resolves as swelling decreases over time. In most cases, simply avoiding hazardous sounds \ngives hair cells all they need to recover. One temporary threshold shift isn’t likely\nto cause permanent hearing loss. But frequent exposure \nto dangerous sound levels can lead to a wide range \nof hearing disorders, such as the constant buzz of tinnitus or difficulty understanding speech\nin loud environments. Overworked hair cells can also generate\ndangerous molecules called reactive oxygen species. These molecules\nhave unpaired electrons, driving them to steal electrons\nfrom nearby cells and cause permanent damage\nto the inner ear. There are numerous strategies you can\nadopt for preventing hearing loss. Current research around earbud headphone\nuse suggests keeping your volume at 80% or less if you’ll be listening for \nmore than 90 minutes throughout the day. Noise-isolating headphones can also help \nyou listen at lower volumes. Getting a baseline understanding \nof your hearing is essential to protecting \nyour auditory system. Just like our eyes and teeth,\nour ears also need annual check-ups. Not all communities have\naccess to audiologists, but organizations around the world are\ndeveloping portable hearing tests and easy-to-use apps to bring these\nvital resources to remote regions. Finally, wear earplugs\nwhen you’re knowingly exposing yourself to loud sounds for extended periods. An earplug’s effectiveness depends \non how well you’ve inserted it, so be careful to read the instructions. But when worn correctly, they can ensure you'll be able\nto hear your favorite band for many nights to come."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When using earbuds for more than 90 minutes throughout the day, keep the volume at ____ or less", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "75%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "80%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "37%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When hair cells swell and recover causing a short duration of hearing loss, it is known as", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Temporary Hearing Loss"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Short-Term Threshold Shift"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Temporary Threshold Shift"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Any of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Injury from sound is dependent on two factors:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Volume and duration"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pitch and rhythm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pitch and duration"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Type of sound and volume"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "There are ____ bones in the ossicular chain:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Hearing protection is only as effective as its", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Marketing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Noise Reduction Rating"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Insertion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Color"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

And some of the most frequent targets \nof this communication regulation are the ums, ers, and likes \nthat pepper our conversations. Ancient Greek and Latin texts warned\nagainst speaking with hesitation, modern schools have tried \nto ban the offending terms, and renowned linguist Noam Chomsky\ndismissed these expressions as “errors” irrelevant to language. Historically, these speech components\nhad been lumped into the broader bucket of “disfluencies”— linguistic fillers which distract \nfrom useful speech. However, none of this controversy has made\nthese so-called disfluencies less common. They continue to occur roughly \n2 to 3 times per minute in natural speech. And different versions of them can\nbe found in almost every language, including sign language. So are ums and uhs \njust a habit we can’t break? Or is there more to them\nthan meets the ear? To answer this question, it helps \nto compare these speech components to other words we use in everyday life. While a written word might have\nmultiple definitions, we can usually determine its intended\nmeaning through context. In speech however, a word can take\non additional layers of meaning. Tone of voice, \nthe relationship between speakers, and expectations of where \na conversation will go can imbue even words that seem like filler\nwith vital information. This is where “um” and “uh” come in. Or “eh” and “ehm,” “tutoa” and “öö,”\n“eto” and “ano.” Linguists call these filled pauses, which\nare a kind of hesitation phenomenon. And these seemingly \ninsignificant interruptions are actually quite meaningful \nin spoken communication. For example, while a silent pause\nmight be interpreted as a sign for others to start speaking, a filled pause can signal\nthat you’re not finished yet. Hesitation phenomena can buy time for your\nspeech to catch up with your thoughts, or to fish out the right word \nfor a situation. And they don’t just benefit the speaker— a filled pause lets your listeners know\nan important word is on the way. Linguists have even found \nthat people are more likely to remember a word \nif it comes after a hesitation. Hesitation phenomena \naren’t the only parts of speech that take on new meaning during dialogue. Words and phrases such as “like,” \n“well” or “you know” function as discourse markers, ignoring their literal meaning to convey \nsomething about the sentence in which they appear. Discourse markers direct \nthe flow of conversation, and some studies suggest \nthat conscientious speakers use more of these phrases to ensure \neveryone is being heard and understood. For example, starting a sentence \nwith “Look...” can indicate your attitude and help \nyou gauge the listener’s agreement. “I mean” can signal that you’re about\nto elaborate on something. And the dreaded “like” \ncan perform many functions, such as establishing a loose\nconnection between thoughts, or introducing someone else's\nwords or actions. These markers give people a real-time\nview into your thought process and help listeners follow, interpret, \nand predict what you’re trying to say. Discourse markers and hesitation phenomena aren’t just useful \nfor understanding language— they help us learn it too. In 2011, a study showed toddlers \ncommon and uncommon objects alongside a recording referring \nto one of the items. When a later recording asked them \nto identify the uncommon object, toddlers performed better if that \ninstruction contained a filled pause. This may mean that filled pauses \ncue toddlers to expect novel words, and help them connect new words\nto new objects. For adolescents and adults \nlearning a second language, filled pauses smooth out awkward \nearly conversations. And once they’re more confident, the second-language learner can signal\ntheir newfound fluency by using the appropriate \nhesitation phenomenon. Because, contrary to popular belief, the use of filled pauses doesn't decrease\nwith mastery of a language. Just because hesitation phenomena\nand discourse markers are a natural part of communication \ndoesn’t mean they’re always appropriate. Outside of writing dialogue, they serve \nno purpose in most formal writing. And in some contexts, the stigma\nthese social cues carry can work against the speaker.

Every day, all around us, we see the consequences of silence manifest themselves in the form of discrimination, violence, genocide and war. In the classroom, I challenge my students to explore the silences in their own lives through poetry. We work together to fill those spaces, to recognize them, to name them, to understand that they don't\nhave to be sources of shame. In an effort to create a culture within my classroom where students feel safe sharing the intimacies of their own silences, I have four core principles posted on the board that sits in the front of my class, which every student signs\nat the beginning of the year: read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, tell your truth. And I find myself thinking a lot about that last point, tell your truth. And I realized that if I was going to ask my students to speak up, I was going to have to tell my truth and be honest with them about the times where I failed to do so. So I tell them that growing up, as a kid in a Catholic family in New Orleans, during Lent I was always taught that the most meaningful thing one could do was to give something up, sacrifice something you typically indulge in to prove to God you understand his sanctity. I've given up soda, McDonald's, French fries, French kisses, and everything in between. But one year, I gave up speaking. I figured the most valuable thing I could sacrifice was my own voice, but it was like I hadn't realized that I had given that up a long time ago. I spent so much of my life telling people the things they wanted to hear instead of the things they needed to, told myself I wasn't meant to be anyone's conscience because I still had to figure out being my own, so sometimes I just wouldn't say anything, appeasing ignorance with my silence, unaware that validation doesn't need words to endorse its existence. When Christian was beat up for being gay, I put my hands in my pocket and walked with my head\ndown as if I didn't even notice. I couldn't use my locker for weeks\nbecause the bolt on the lock reminded me of the one I had put on my lips when the homeless man on the corner looked at me with eyes up merely searching for an affirmation that he was worth seeing. I was more concerned with\ntouching the screen on my Apple than actually feeding him one. When the woman at the fundraising gala said \"I'm so proud of you. It must be so hard teaching\nthose poor, unintelligent kids,\" I bit my lip, because apparently\nwe needed her money more than my students needed their dignity. We spend so much time listening to the things people are saying that we rarely pay attention to the things they don't. Silence is the residue of fear. It is feeling your flaws gut-wrench guillotine your tongue. It is the air retreating from your chest because it doesn't feel safe in your lungs. Silence is Rwandan genocide. Silence is Katrina. It is what you hear when there\naren't enough body bags left. It is the sound after the noose is already tied. It is charring. It is chains. It is privilege. It is pain. There is no time to pick your battles when your battles have already picked you. I will not let silence wrap itself around my indecision. I will tell Christian that he is a lion, a sanctuary of bravery and brilliance. I will ask that homeless man what his name is and how his day was, because sometimes all people want to be is human. I will tell that woman that my students can talk about transcendentalism like their last name was Thoreau, and just because you watched\none episode of \"The Wire\" doesn't mean you know anything about my kids. So this year, instead of giving something up, I will live every day as if there were a microphone tucked under my tongue, a stage on the underside of my inhibition. Because who has to have a soapbox when all you've ever needed is your voice? Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 82, "lesson": 22, "title": "How to build (and rebuild) trust - Frances Frei", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-build-and-rebuild-trust-frances-frei", "transcript": {"en": "I want to talk to you about\nhow to build and rebuild trust, because it's my belief that trust is the foundation for everything we do, and that if we can learn\nto trust one another more, we can have unprecedented human progress. But what if trust is broken? What if your CEO is caught on video,\ndisparaging an employee? What if your employees experience\na culture of bias, exclusion and worse? What if there's a data breach, and it feels an awful lot like a cover-up\nthan seriously addressing it? And most tragically, what if a technological fail\nleads to the loss of human life? If I was giving this talk six months ago, I would have been wearing an Uber T-shirt. I'm a Harvard Business School professor, but I was super attracted\nto going to an organization that was metaphorically\nand perhaps quite literally on fire. I had read everything\nthat was written in the newspaper, and that was precisely what drew me\nto the organization. This was an organization\nthat had lost trust with every constituent that mattered. But there's a word about me\nthat I should share. My favorite trait is redemption. I believe that there is a better\nversion of us around every corner, and I have seen firsthand how organizations and communities and individuals change\nat breathtaking speed. I went to Uber with the hopes\nthat a turnaround there could give license to the rest of us who might have narrower versions\nof their challenges. But when I got to Uber,\nI made a really big mistake. I publicly committed\nto wearing an Uber T-shirt every day until every other employee\nwas wearing an Uber T-shirt. I had clearly not thought that through. (Laughter) It was 250 days\nof wearing an Uber T-shirt. Now I am liberated from that commitment, as I am back at HBS, and what I'd like to do is share with you how far I have taken that liberty, which, it's baby steps, (Laughter) but I would just say I'm on my way. (Laughter) Now, trust, if we're going to rebuild it, we have to understand its component parts. The component parts of trust\nare super well understood. There's three things about trust. If you sense that I am being authentic, you are much more likely to trust me. If you sense that I have\nreal rigor in my logic, you are far more likely to trust me. And if you believe that my empathy\nis directed towards you, you are far more likely to trust me. When all three\nof these things are working, we have great trust. But if any one of these three gets shaky, if any one of these three wobbles, trust is threatened. Now here's what I'd like to do. I want each of us to be able\nto engender more trust tomorrow, literally tomorrow, than we do today. And the way to do that is to understand\nwhere trust wobbles for ourselves and have a ready-made\nprescription to overcome it. So that's what I would like\nto do together. Would you give me some sense\nof whether or not you're here voluntarily? (Laughter) Yeah. OK. Alright. Awesome. OK. So -- (Laughter) it's just super helpful feedback. (Laughter) So the most common wobble is empathy. The most common wobble is that people just don't believe\nthat we're mostly in it for them, and they believe\nthat we're too self-distracted. And it's no wonder. We are all so busy\nwith so many demands on our time, it's easy to crowd out the time and space that empathy requires. For Dylan to be Dylan,\nthat takes real time. And for us, if we have too much to do,\nwe may not have that time. But that puts us into a vicious cycle, because without revealing empathy, it makes everything harder. Without the benefit of the doubt of trust,\nit makes everything harder, and then we have less and less time\nfor empathy, and so it goes. So here's the prescription: identify where, when and to whom you are likely to offer your distraction. That should trace pretty perfectly to when, where and to whom\nyou are likely to withhold your empathy. And if in those instances, we can come up with a trigger\nthat gets us to look up, look at the people right in front of us, listen to them, deeply immerse ourselves\nin their perspectives, then we have a chance of having\na sturdy leg of empathy. And if you do nothing else, please put away your cell phone. It is the largest distraction magnet\nyet to be made, and it is super difficult to create\nempathy and trust in its presence. That takes care of the empathy wobblers. Logic wobbles can come in two forms. It's either the quality of your logic or it's your ability\nto communicate the logic. Now if the quality\nof your logic is at risk, I can't really help you with that. (Laughter) It's like, not in this much time. (Laughter) But fortunately, it's often the case\nthat our logic is sound, but it's our ability to communicate\nthe logic that is in jeopardy. Super fortunately,\nthere's a very easy fix to this. If we consider that there are\ntwo ways to communicate in the world, and Harvard Business School professors\nare known for two-by-twos -- nonsense, it's the triangle that rocks. (Laughter) If we consider that there are\ntwo ways to communicate in the world, and the first one is when\nyou take us on a journey, a magnificent journey\nthat has twists and turns and mystery and drama, until you ultimately get to the point, and some of the best\ncommunicators in the world communicate just like this. But if you have a logic wobble, this can be super dangerous. So instead, I implore you, start with your point\nin a crisp half-sentence, and then give your supporting evidence. This means that people\nwill be able to get access to our awesome ideas, and just as importantly, if you get cut off before you're done ... ladies -- (Laughter) (Applause) If you get cut off before you're done, you still get credit for the idea, as opposed to someone else coming in\nand snatching it from you. (Applause) You just gave me goosebumps. (Laughter) The third wobble is authenticity,\nand I find it to be the most vexing. We as a human species\ncan sniff out in a moment, literally in a moment, whether or not someone\nis being their authentic true self. So in many ways,\nthe prescription is clear. You don't want to have\nan authenticity wobble? Be you. Great. And that is super easy to do when you're around people\nwho are like you. But if you represent\nany sort of difference, the prescription to \"be you\"\ncan be super challenging. I have been tempted\nat every step of my career, tempted personally\nand tempted by coaching of others, to mute who I am in the world. I'm a woman of super strong opinions, with really deep convictions, direct speech. I have a magnificent wife, and together, we have such crazy ambition. I prefer men's clothes and comfortable shoes. Thank you, Allbirds. (Laughter) In some contexts, this makes me different. I hope that each person here has the beautiful luxury\nof representing difference in some context in your life. But with that privilege comes a very sincere temptation\nto hold back who we are, and if we hold back who we are, we're less likely to be trusted. And if we're less likely to be trusted, we're less likely to be given\nstretch assignments. And without those stretch assignments,\nwe're less likely to get promoted, and so on and so on\nuntil we are super depressed by the demographic tendencies\nof our senior leadership. (Laughter) And it all comes back\nto our being our authentic selves. So here's my advice. Wear whatever makes you feel fabulous. Pay less attention to what you think\npeople want to hear from you and far more attention to what\nyour authentic, awesome self needs to say. And to the leaders in the room, it is your obligation to set the conditions that not only\nmake it safe for us to be authentic but make it welcome, make it celebrated, cherish it for exactly what it is, which is the key for us\nachieving greater excellence than we have ever known is possible. So let's go back to Uber.\nWhat happened at Uber? When I got there,\nUber was wobbling all over the place. Empathy, logic, authenticity\nwere all wobbling like crazy. But we were able to find super effective,\nsuper quick fixes for two of the wobbles. I'll give you an illustration of empathy. In the meetings at Uber, it was not uncommon\nfor people to be texting one another ... about the meeting. (Laughter) I had never seen anything like it. (Laughter) It may have done many things, but it did not create a safe,\nempathetic environment. The solution though, super clear: technology, off and away. And that forced people to look up, to look at the people in front of them, to listen to them, to immerse themselves\nin their perspectives and to collaborate in unprecedented ways. Logic was equally wobbly, and this was because\nthe hypergrowth of the organization meant that people, managers\nwere getting promoted again and again and again. Soon, they were put in positions\nthat they had no business being in. Their positions outstripped\ntheir capability, and it was not their fault. The solution: a massive influx\nof executive education that focused specifically on logic, on strategy and leadership. It gave people the rigor\nof the quality of their logic, and it turned a whole lot\nof triangles, right-side up, so people were able to communicate\neffectively with one another. The last one, authenticity,\nI'll say it's still mighty wobbly, but honestly, that doesn't\nmake Uber very different from all of the other companies\nI've seen in Silicon Valley and beyond. It is still much easier\nto coach people to fit in. It is still much easier to reward people when they say something\nthat you were going to say, as opposed to rewarding people\nwhen they say something entirely different\nthan what you were going to say. But when we figure out this, when we figure out\nhow to celebrate difference and how to let people bring\nthe best version of themselves forward, well holy cow, is that the world\nI want my sons to grow up in. And with the collection of people here, it would be a privilege\nto lock arms with you and go ahead and rebuild trust\nin every corner of the globe. Thank you very much.

She’s infected with several\ndeadly viruses, including ones that cause rabies,\nSARS, and Ebola. But while her diagnosis would be lethal\nfor other mammals, this winged wonder is totally unfazed. In fact, she may even spend\nthe next 30 years living as if this were totally normal–\nbecause for bats, it is. So what’s protecting her\nfrom these dangerous infections? To answer this question,\nwe first need to understand the relationship between\nviruses and their hosts. Every virus has evolved to infect specific\nspecies within a class of creatures. This is why humans are unlikely\nto be infected by plant viruses, and why bees don’t catch the flu. However, viruses do sometimes jump\nacross closely related species And because the new host\nhas no established immune defenses, the unknown virus presents\na potentially lethal challenge. This is actually bad news\nfor the virus as well. Their ideal host provides a steady stream\nof resources and comes into contact with new parties\nto infect— two criteria that are best met\nby living hosts. All this to say that successful viruses don’t typically evolve adaptations\nthat kill their hosts— including the viruses that have infected\nour flying friend. The deadly effects of these viruses\naren’t caused by the pathogens directly, but rather, by their host’s uncontrolled\nimmune response. Infections like Ebola\nor certain types of flu have evolved to strain the immune system\nof their mammalian host by sending it into overdrive. The body sends hordes\nof white blood cells, antibodies and inflammatory molecules\nto kill the foreign invader. But if the infection has progressed\nto high enough levels, an assault by the immune system\ncan lead to serious tissue damage. In particularly virulent cases,\nthis damage can be lethal. And even when it’s not, the site is left vulnerable\nto secondary infection. But unlike other mammals, bats have been in an evolutionary arms\nrace with these viruses for millennia, and they’ve adapted to limit\nthis kind of self-damage. Their immune system\nhas a very low inflammatory response; an adaptation likely developed\nalongside the other trait that sets them apart from other mammals:\nself-powered flight. This energy-intensive process can raise\na bat’s body temperature to over 40ºC. Such a high metabolic rate\ncomes at a cost; flight produces waste molecules\ncalled Reactive Oxygen Species that damage and break off\nfragments of DNA. In other mammals, this loose DNA would be attacked by the immune system\nas a foreign invader. But if bats produce these molecules\nas often as researchers believe, they may have evolved\na dampened immune response to their own damaged DNA. In fact, certain genes associated\nwith sensing broken DNA and deploying inflammatory molecules\nare absent from the bat genome. The result is a controlled\nlow-level inflammatory response that allows bats to coexist\nwith the viruses in their systems. Even more impressive, bats are able to host these viruses\nfor decades without any negative health consequences. According to a 2013 study, bats\nhave evolved efficient repair genes to counteract the frequent\nDNA damage they sustain. These repair genes may also contribute\nto their long lives. Animal chromosomes end with a DNA sequence\ncalled a telomere. These sequences shorten over time\nin a process that many believe contributes\nto cell aging. But bat telomeres shorten much more slowly\nthan their mammalian cousins— granting them lifespans\nas long as 41 years. Of course, bats aren’t totally\ninvincible to disease, whether caused by bacteria,\nunfamiliar viruses, or even fungi. Bat populations have been ravaged\nby a fungal infection called white-nose syndrome, which can fatally disrupt hibernation\nand deteriorate wing tissue. These conditions prevent bats\nfrom performing critical roles in their ecosystems, like helping\nwith pollination and seed dispersal, and consuming pests and insects. To protect these animals from harm,\nand ourselves from infection, humans need to stop encroaching\non bat habitats and ecosystems. Hopefully, preserving these populations will allow scientists to better understand\nbats’ unique antiviral defense systems. And maybe one day, this research will\nhelp our own viral immunity take flight."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Virus infections would ideally kill its host.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Viruses that have evolved in bats cause severe disease in humans because", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Humans do not have wings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Human immune system goes into an overdrive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Humans cannot hibernate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the key adaptation that allows bats to tolerate virus infections better than humans?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A fruit diet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An insect diet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A low inflammatory response"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inability to mount an immune response"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What waste molecules are produced during flight?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shedding skin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reactive oxygen species"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Saliva"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Urine"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What fungus infection has ravaged bat populations?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "White fungus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Athlete’s foot"}, {"label": "C", "text": "White-nose syndrome fungus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "White-foot fungus"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

He’d recently traversed the region \njust a few weeks ago, and most of the villagers had already\nseen his supply. So he wandered the outskirts of the town in the hopes of finding \nsome new customers. Unfortunately, the road was largely\ndeserted, and the salesman was about to turn back, when he heard a high-pitched yelp\ncoming from the edge of the forest. Following the screams to their source,\nhe discovered a trapped tanuki. While these racoon-like creatures \nwere known for their wily ways, this one appeared terrified and powerless. The salesman freed \nthe struggling creature, but before he could tend to its wounds,\nit bolted into the undergrowth. The next day, he set off \non his usual route. As he trudged along, \nhe spotted a discarded tea kettle. It was rusty and old— but perhaps \nhe could sell it to the local monks. The salesman polished it \nuntil it sparkled and shone. He carried the kettle to Morin-ji Temple\nand presented it to the solemn monks. His timing was perfect— they were in need of a large kettle\nfor an important service, and purchased his pot \nfor a handsome price. To open the ceremony, they began \nto pour cups of tea for each monk— but the kettle cooled too quickly. It had to be reheated often throughout\nthe long service, and when it was hot,\nit seemed to squirm in the pourer’s hand. By the end of the ceremony, the monks\nfelt cheated by their purchase, and called for the salesman to return \nand explain himself. The following morning, \nthe salesman examined the pot, but he couldn’t find \nanything unusual about it. Hoping a cup of tea \nwould help them think, they set the kettle on the fire. Within moments, the metal \nbegan to sweat. Suddenly, it sprouted a scrubby tail,\nfurry paws and pointed nose. With a yelp, the salesman recognized\nthe tanuki he’d freed. The salesman was shocked. He’d heard tales of shape-shifting tanuki who transformed by pulling\non their testicles. But they were usually\ntroublesome tricksters, who played embarrassing pranks\non travellers, or made it rain money \nthat later dissolved into leaves. Some people even placed tanuki statues\noutside their homes and businesses to trick potential pranksters\ninto taking their antics elsewhere. However, this tanuki only smiled sweetly. Why had he chosen this unsuspecting form? The tanuki explained that he wanted\nto repay the salesman’s kindness. However, he’d grown too hot \nas a tea kettle, and didn’t like being burned,\nscrubbed, or polished. The monk and salesman laughed, both\nimpressed by this honourable trickster. From that day on, the tanuki became\nan esteemed guest of the temple. He could frequently be found \ntelling tales and performing tricks that amused even the most serious monks. Villagers came from far away \nto see the temple tanuki, and the salesman visited often to share\ntea made from an entirely normal kettle."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "On his travels, a kindly travelling salesman discovered:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A racoon in a trap"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A tanuki in a trap"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A cat in a trap"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An injured monk"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "After discovering a rusty tea kettle, the salesman sold it to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A zoo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A restaurant"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A monastery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A hardware shop"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "According to myth, tanukis were magic shape-shifters who changed their form by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pulling on their ears"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Blinking their eyes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tugging on their testicles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Heating their bodies"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The tanuki transformed into a kettle to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Repay the salesman for his kindness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wreak havoc on the monks’ quiet lives"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Play tricks on the salesman"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because he loved tea"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "After his discovery, the tanuki:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Returned to his roadside home"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Was punished by the monks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Entertained the monks and visitors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kept the form of a tea kettle"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
