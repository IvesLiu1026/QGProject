{"en": "[Music] [Applause] I'm a Sant or more precisely a high functioning autistic Sant it's a rare condition and uh where still when accompanied as in my case by self-awareness and a Mastery of language very often when I meet someone and they learn this about me there's a certain kind of awkwardness I can see it in their eyes they want to ask me something and in the end quite often the urge is stronger than they are and they blurted out if I give you my date of birth can you tell me what day of the week I was born on or they mention cube roots or um ask me to recite a long number or a long text I hope you'll forgive me if I don't perform a kind of one man Sant show for you today I uh am going to talk instead about something far more interesting than dates of birth or cube roots a little deeper and a lot closer to my mind and work I want to talk to you briefly about perception when he was writing the plays and the short stories that would make his name Anton COV kept a notebook in which he noted down his observations of the world around him little details that other people seem to miss every time I recheck of and his unique vision of human life I'm reminded of why I too became a writer in my books I explore the nature of perception and how different kinds of perceiving create different kinds of knowing and understanding here are three questions drawn from my work rather than try to figure them out I'm going to ask you to consider for a moment the intuitions and the gut instincts that are going through your head and your heart as you look at them for example the calculation can you feel where on a number line the solution is likely to fall or look at the foreign word and the sounds can you get a sense of the range of meanings that it's pointing you towards and in terms of the line of poetry why does the poet use the word hair rather than rabbit I'm asking you to do this because I believe that our personal perceptions you see are at the heart of how we acquire knowledge aesthetic judgments rather than abstract reasoning guide and shape the process by which we all come to know what we know I'm an extremist example of this my worlds of words and numbers blare with color emotion and personality as Juan said it's a condition that scientists call synesthesia an unusual cross talk between the senses here are the numbers 1 to 12 as I see them every number with its own shape and character one is is a flash of bright light six is a tiny and very sad black hole the sketches are in black and white here but in my mind they have colors three is green four is blue five is yellow I paint as well and here is one of my paintings it's a multiplication of two prime numbers three dimensional shapes and the space they create in the middle creates a new shape the answer to the sum what about bigger numbers well you can't get much bigger than Pi the mathematical constant it's an infinite number literally goes on forever in this painting that I made of the first 20 decimals of pi I take the colors And the emotions and the textures and I pull them all together into a kind of rolling numerical landscape but it's not only numbers that I see in colors words too for me have colors and emotions and textures and this is an opening phrase from the novel Lolita and narof was himself synesthetic and you can see here how my perception of the the sound L helps the alliteration to jump right out another example a little bit more mathematical and I wonder if some of you will notice the construction of the sentence from The Great Gatsby there is a procession of syllables wheat one prairies two lost swed towns three one 1 2 3 and this effect is very pleasant on the mind and it helps the sentence to feel right let's go back to the questions I posed you a moment ago um 64 multiplied by 75 if someone of you play chess you'll know that 64 is a square number and that's why chess boards 8 by 8 have 64 squares so that gives us a form that we can picture that we can perceive what about 75 well if 100 if we think of 100 as being like a square 75 would look like this so what we need to do now is put those two pictures together in our mind something like this 64 comes 6,400 and in the right hand corner you don't have to calculate anything four across four up and down it's 16 so what the sum is actually asking you to do is 16 16 16 that's a lot easier than the way that the school taught you to do maths I'm sure it's uh 16 16 16 48 4800 4,8 00 the answer to the sum easier when you know how the second question was an Icelandic word I'm assuming there are not many people here who speak Icelandic so let me narrow the choices down to twoin is it a happy word or a sad word what do you say happy okay some people say it's happy most people a majority of people say sad and it actually mean sad why do statistically a majority of people say that a word is sad in this case heavy in other cases in my theory language evolves in such a way that sound match correspond with the subjective with the personal intuitive experience of The Listener let's have a look at the the third question it's a line from a poem by John Keat words like numbers Express fundamental relationships between objects and events and forces that constitute our world it stands to reason that we existing in this world should in the course of Our Lives absorb intuitively those relationships and Poets like other artists play with those intuitive understandings in the case of hair it's an ambiguous sound in English it can also mean the fibers that grow from our head and if we think of that we put the picture up the fibers represent vulnerability uh they yield to the slightest movement or motion or emotion so um what you have is an atmosphere of vulnerability and tension the hair itself the animal not the cat not a dog a hair why a hair because think of the picture not the word the picture the overlong ears the overlarge feet helps us to picture to feel intuitively what it means to limp and to tremble so in these few minutes I hope I've been able to share a little bit of my vision of things and to show you that words can have colors and emotions numbers shapes and personalities the world is richer vaster than it too often seems to be I hope that that uh I've given you the desire to learn to see the world with new eyes thank you"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Daniel Tammet believes that our personal perceptions are at the heart of how we acquire ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Friendships"},

But it's actually your brain running a complex series of calculations\nwithin a matter of seconds that's responsible\nfor determining attraction. Doesn't sound quite as poetic, does it? But just because the calculations\nare happening in your brain doesn't mean those warm,\nfuzzy feelings are all in your head. In fact, all five\nof your senses play a role, each able to vote for,\nor veto, a budding attraction. The eyes are the first\ncomponents in attraction. Many visual beauty standards vary\nbetween cultures and eras, and signs of youth,\nfertility and good health, such as long lustrous hair, or smooth, scar-free skin, are almost always in demand because they're associated\nwith reproductive fitness. And when the eyes spot\nsomething they like, our instinct is to move closer so the other senses can investigate. The nose's contribution to romance is more than noticing perfume or cologne. It's able to pick up\non natural chemical signals known as pheromones. These not only convey important physical or genetic information\nabout their source but are able to activate a physiological\nor behavioral response in the recipient. In one study, a group of women at different points\nin their ovulation cycles wore the same T-shirts for three nights. After male volunteers\nwere randomly assigned to smell either one of the worn shirts,\nor a new unworn one, saliva samples showed\nan increase in testosterone in those who had smelled a shirt worn\nby an ovulating woman. Such a testosterone boost may give a man the nudge to pursue a woman he might not have otherwise noticed. A woman's nose is particularly attuned to MHC molecules,\nwhich are used to fight disease. In this case, opposites attract. When a study asked women to smell T-shirts\nthat had been worn by different men, they preferred the odors of those\nwhose MHC molecules differed from theirs. This makes sense. Genes that result in a greater\nvariety of immunities may give offspring\na major survival advantage. Our ears also determine attraction. Men prefer females\nwith high-pitched, breathy voices, and wide formant spacing,\ncorrelated with smaller body size. While women prefer low-pitched voices\nwith a narrow formant spacing that suggest a larger body size. And not surprisingly, touch turns out to be crucial for romance. In this experiment,\nnot realizing the study had begun, participants were asked\nto briefly hold the coffee, either hot or iced. Later, the participants read a story\nabout a hypothetical person, and were asked to rate their personality. Those who had held the hot cup of coffee perceived the person\nin the story as happier, more social, more generous\nand better-natured than those who had held\nthe cup of iced coffee, who rated the person as cold,\nstoic, and unaffectionate. If a potential mate has managed\nto pass all these tests, there's still one more: the infamous first kiss, a rich and complex exchange\nof tactile and chemical cues, such as the smell of one's breath, and the taste of their mouth. This magical moment is so critical\nthat a majority of men and women have reported losing\ntheir attraction to someone after a bad first kiss. Once attraction is confirmed,\nyour bloodstream is flooded with norepinephrine, activating your fight or flight system. Your heart beats faster, your pupils dilate, and your body releases glucose\nfor additional energy, not because you're in danger\nbut because your body is telling you that something important is happening. To help you focus, norepinephrine creates\na sort of tunnel vision, blocking out surrounding distractions, possibly even warping your sense of time, and enhancing your memory. This might explain why people\nnever forget their first kiss. The idea of so much of our attraction being influenced by chemicals\nand evolutionary biology may seem cold and scientific\nrather than romantic, but the next time\nyou see someone you like, try to appreciate how your entire body\nis playing matchmaker to decide if that beautiful\nstranger is right for you."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A chemical messenger emitted from one organism that activates a physiological or behavioral response in another is called what?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Placebo"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hormones"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pheromones"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Saliva"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Sometimes, a man’s testosterone increases when her smells a shirt worn my a _________women?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Perspiring"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ovulating"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Non-ovulating"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Clean"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules are part of what system?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Immune system"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Digestive system"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lymphatic system"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cardiovascular system"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In the coffee study, participants who held the hot coffee rated the hypothetical person as ____________?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unaffectionate"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Creative"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Happier"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stoic"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Once attraction is confirmed, your bloodstream floods with what?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dopamine"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Norepinephrine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Adrenaline"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Serotonin"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 51, "lesson": 3, "title": "A mathematical fable", "category": "Mathematics", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/YPgDIdpE", "transcript": {"en": "I'm going to tell you a fable. A king, growing old, has two daughters and wants to partition his land. He goes to his counsellor and says 'Counsellor, I have four pieces of land and two daughters and I want to partition my land equally amongst my daughters. My surveyor says that the land masses I have are of this shape: I have one triangular piece of land and it has a square angle here. 'A right angle' says the counsellor, 'you have a right angled triangle.'\n'Ahh a right angled triangle. And then I have a square piece of land whose edge is the side of the longest side of my triangle. And I have another whose edge is the side of this side of the triangle; and a third the side of this side of the triangle. The surveyor tells me they're all squares.' The counsellor says \n'Oh, no problem, don't be one of these foolish kings who gives away all your land. Keep that triangular piece for yourself, give the largest square to one of your daughters and the two small squares to the other daughter, it'll be perfectly even.' 'That's easy!' since the king and he's about to leave but then says\n'Counsellor, I haven't told you anything about how long the sides of these squares are, or the shape of the triangle'\nCounsellor says 'Don't worry. What we have here is three squares, one triangle. If the edges of these pieces of land are doubled all the areas get multiplied by four, if they're tripled all the areas get multiplied by nine, that's three squared. If you changed all the lengths of your figures by some factor the area is changed by the square of the factor and so the proportions are exactly the same.' Counsellor says \n'This is called scaling and similarity. If you scale your figures in this way you get similar figures, scaling a length by some factor scales the area by the square.' \n'Wonderful!' says the King. King walks away but even before he leaves the room he says 'But I didn't tell you what the angles were \nof the triangle.' Counsellor says 'Uh, that doesn't matter. What we have here is something called the Pythagorean theorem; it doesn't matter what the angles are as long as one of those angles is a right angle.' King leaves. Returns the next day distraught and says 'My surveyor tells me I don't have squares I have things that he called blobs! That is I have a triangle, a right angled triangle, I have three fields each landmass has one linear edge - the linear edge equal to the edge of the corresponding edge of the triangle - and he also tells me that my blobs are similar. If I scale any one of these blobs appropriately it will become any of the others. Now what do I do?' asks the King apprehensively and the counsellor says 'No problem. Do exactly as before. You keep your triangle, give the larger- largest blob mass to one of your daughters and the other two to the other daughter and it'll be even Steven.\nThe king is amazed. He says 'It doesn't matter what blob they are as long as they're similar?' \nCounsellor says yes. 'What do you call that?' \nsays the King. 'Oh I call that the blob Pythagorean theorem.' 'For every blob there's a blob Pythagorean theorem?' says the King' 'Strange.' The counsellor says \n'Yes, and not only that but if you know the blob Pythagorean theorem for any blob you know it for every blob.' The king says 'How? How can that be?' \nWell the counsellor says 'Look, look at this: you have three blobs here, imagine that there's what I'll call a unit blob, that's to say a blob that's similar to it but its length is 1. Let us say the length of its straight edge is 1. \nWhy then, if the length of this straight edge is c and the length of this straight edge is a and the length of this straight edge is b, then we know that whatever area this blob has - what do you call the\narea of that blob? Capital A, the area \nof the unit blob. The area of this blob is the square of the factor that one needs in order to scale the unit blob to it, so the area will be c squared times A. The area of this will be a squared times A and the area this will be b squared times A. So if I prove to you that for some blob with some area A, this large blob is the sum in area of the areas of these two small ones, what I will have shown is c squared times A is equal to a squared times A plus b squared times A; and cancelling out the A's I have c squared is equal to a squared plus b squared and so if you give me any other blob I will get exactly the same result.' 'So one blob Pythagorean theorem implies Pythagorean theorem for all blobs?' says the King and he leaves sort of contented. King\ncomes in, day three, and he says 'It's wonderful what you've told me, what you've explained to me, but can you show me the blob Pythagorean theorem for some blob in which case I'll know it for all?' Counsellor says 'Oh well, for that you have to draw me a right-angled triangle.' And the counsellor says 'Ah well, so my job then would be to produce a blob with a linear side of length c, a blob with a linear side of length b, that blob being similar to the blob of length c, and a blob with length a similar for the other two; and then I will have to show you that the area of the larger- largest of these blobs is the sum of the area of the other two blobs.' The king says 'Well, yes, this might be quite a chore.' The counsellor\nsays 'Well, try this-' Counsellor draws a\nsingle line which meets the large side in a right angle. And then steps back and says \n'There you are.' 'Where am I?' says the king. \n'The blob whose linear edge is c is the entire triangle. The blob whose linear edge is b is the triangle to the right. The blob whose linear edge is a is the triangle to the\nleft. All these triangles are right-angled triangles because one of their angles is a right angle. Each of these triangles have another angle in common; for example this large triangle has this angle in common with this one, and it has this angle in common with this one. All three right angle triangles are similar. So those are my three blobs and to see that the sum of the two small blobs is equal to the large blob is evident.' King says 'Ah.' Okay so now what's my moral? Can you\nguess?

{"page": 51, "lesson": 5, "title": "Rutherfordium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/EDHbZ008", "transcript": {"en": "We are here in the basement of the Royal Society\nin London, The Royal Society is the UK National Academy for Sciences and we are here because\nthere is an exhibition about Rutherford. We are interested in the element Rutherfordium\nwhich is right here at the bottom of the periodic table number 104, and with these elements\nonly tiny amounts, relatively few atoms have been made so we can’t tell you about how\nit is used in light bulbs or something like that because it has not been used for anything.\nPeople are really excited if they make one or two atoms of it. So instead we are going\nto tell you a bit about Rutherford after whom it’s named. And Rutherford is famous because\nhe did a whole series of experiments, or he and his co-workers, that really explained\nthe structure of atoms and so the periodic table for the first time really began to make\nsense. Over here you can see there is a picture of Rutherford here in his lab with one of\nhis co-workers and this is a very famous picture. Rutherford, who came from New Zealand, had\na very loud voice and the experiments were rather sensitive, if you talked too loud the\napparatus started shaking and it did not work properly, so his students put up a big notice\nin the lab saying talk softly please. But I am not sure that it stopped him and I use\nthis picture when I am talking to my students about safety, you’ve always got to be really\nsafe when you are working as a chemist. First of all you can see that Rutherford is smoking\nin the lab and then he is not wearing safety glasses, nor is his colleague, and then they\nhave a whole series of wires and all sorts of things to trip over. So it is really surprising\nthat they managed to get their experiments to work without some sort of serious accident.\nPerhaps they did break things and never told us about it. Anyway Rutherford’s work was\nrecognised by him winning the Nobel Prize and here, and it is quite exciting, there\nis a replica of the Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prize is a gold medal but here they have shown\nit as two half-medals, underneath there is nothing to see, so you can see both of the\nsides. So on one side there is the portrait of Alfred Nobel, whose money and foundation,\nstill to this day, pays for prize money, when he received this it would have been presented\nto him by the Swedish King in a huge ceremony in Stockholm. Now what I can’t remember\nis whether he got the Nobel Prize for physics or chemistry. I have a feeling… Chemistry! Yes. I have a feeling that he got it for chemistry\nwhich was particularly funny because Rutherford didn’t like chemistry. He said that there\nis just physics and stamp collecting and he did not really respect chemistry so perhaps\nthe chemists got their revenge by giving him the Nobel Prize for chemistry. Now Rutherford had very strong views about\nthe hours his students should work and they were not allowed to work after 6 o’clock\nat night in the lab and his chief technician would go round the lab at 6 o’clock and\nswitch off all the apparatus and chase everybody out of the lab. And even though they did this,\n11 of his students won Nobel Prizes; this must be one of the records for any single\nresearch group to this day. And of course when they went home having had dinner and\ndrank wine in the college then they started working writing papers. But it is very interesting\nthat if you read letters from visiting American scientists they could not understand how Rutherford’s\nlab was so successful because the people came in at 10 o’clock in the morning they went\nhome at 6, and did not seem to do any work at all, but they discovered all these wonderful\nthings. What’s your policy on your students working\nthen? Well I always encourage my students to work\nbut I find that if I encourage them too hard, it has the opposite effect, just like parents\ntelling children to do their homework but by and large when people are enthusiastic\nabout their science it is difficult to stop them working too much. As part of this exhibition they have got some\npostcards of Rutherford and this one has got, I think it is really terrific, shows Rutherford\nin the sea. But I really like this because it shows that famous scientists sometimes\ntake time off and they don’t always behave like white-coated figures in labs, but they\ndo have a human side as well."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "After which great scientist was rutherfordium named?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ernest Rutherford"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rutherford Ernst"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Maximilian Rutherford"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was Ernest Rutherford’s main area of research?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Atomic structure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Organic chemistry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Analytical chemistry"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Does rutherfordium have any applications in our daily lives?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is used in light bulbs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is used in automobiles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It has no applications"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 51, "lesson": 6, "title": "Lawrencium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/O7MUVAir", "transcript": {"en": "So we’re in the basement of the Royal Society\nin London. This is the UK Academy of Sciences. They have exhibitions\nhere telling people about interesting things about science, and so we\nhave come here because there’s a really interesting exhibit relevant\nto the work of Lawrence who was the person after whom the element Lawrencium\nwas named after. Lawrencium is another one of the elements\nright at the bottom of the periodic table which are really heavy, very\nradioactive. They fall to pieces very rapidly. So chemists are very,\nand physicists are very lucky if they just make a few atoms of this. So\nthere’s nothing to tell you about the uses of lawrencium, because nobody’s\nmade enough lawrencium to use it for anything, except\nas the subject of scientific papers and physical measurements. So instead\nI want to show you here a piece of equipment which is very similar\nto the sort of equipment that Lawrence used when he was doing his pioneering\nwork in Berkeley, California, close to San Francisco. So let’s\ngo along here. Lawrence was famous for inventing an instrument\ncalled the Cyclotron which was for accelerating electrons to very\nhigh speeds. It was in fact the precursor of the large Hadron Collider\nwhich everybody’s now talking about. But he thought of it I think one day\nin the library in Berkeley, and he imagined to begin with an instrument that\nwas literally as big as my two hands here, a few inches across, and his\nidea was that if you made a vessel which was quite flat and circular\nnot very high and put in it a big magnetic field the electrons could go round\nand round and round, and be accelerated to go faster and faster. The idea\nwas that he made one and demonstrated the principle and he patented\nit and then he built bigger and bigger and bigger machines and as he made\nthem, not only did the disc get bigger, but at the same time the\nmagnet got bigger as well. And the final magnet that he made in Berkeley,\nwhich was installed just before the Second World War, was so large\nthat a large part of his research group could sit between the poles\nof the magnet and it’s so heavy that the magnet is still there to this\nday. But come and look over here. This is a Cyclotron that was built in\nCambridge. The first thing that strikes you is that it doesn’t look very\nexciting. It’s two copper discs, which are not actually connected together\nand the voltage is switched between one disc and the other so as the electron\ngoes round when it gets to the end of one you switch the voltage\nso it goes on being accelerated and it goes round and round, and\nas it goes round in a magnetic field the faster it goes the bigger\nthe circle. So it goes round and round and round in a larger and larger\ncircle until the end it flies out of one of these tubes. I think again that\nit is important to say that some of these historic physics experiments, which\nare so important to both chemistry and physics, were done with equipment\nthat really looks surprisingly simple and it is the really clever\nideas that have been so important to physics and chemistry rather\nthan always having enormously complicated apparatus. Sometimes\nto take these ideas to their full extreme you do need complicated\napparatus but that’s not the starting point. Well I’ve read quite a bit about him. He\nwas meant to be a very egotistical person and a real control freak,\nbut my father-in-law worked in Lawrence’s research group. When he was\nan English undergraduate he was sent to America during the Second World\nWar to work in Lawrence’s group on the enrichment of uranium isotopes.\nThat is, concentrating Uranium-235, the less-common isotope which\nwas the basis for the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. So John Keane, my father-in-law, worked in\nthe research group, I don’t know exactly what he did, but it’s really\nquite a sobering thought that during the Second World War some of the brightest\nscientists had to work on these terrible projects really in\norder to save their countries.

the other elements I think because it's quite rare and it is also quite hard to separate rhenium let's look at the rhenium looks like so this is a sample of rhenium okay this is a very very nice metal often used in catalysis from the middle of the transition metal group and here you see the very very dark black coloration of this very very fine wire of rhenium so I'd never seen a sample of metallic rhenium until about a month ago when I was given some as a present so here's the sample it's quite a nice silvery metal and what surprising is that it's really very heavy because elements low down on the periodic table are very dense and we can demonstrate this by weighing it let me compare the rhenium with the pile of five American 10 cent pieces five dimes so this is half a dollar and you can see this is bigger than that considerably so if we weigh the coins you can see it weighs just a bit more than 11 grams eleven point three grams which is quite reasonable because they're made out of copper and nickel and if we now take these off and put on the rhenium which is a smaller lump of metal you can see that it weighs more than 16 grams so it's a really very dense metal we give someone a little little shot of rhenium as a present so this comes from the managing director Nicoll Lippmann who make or supply rare metals and he came to give me an interview for a magazine and he gave me a sample of this element so I was really excited he gave it to me in this bag together with the analysis of the element and it's 99.9% pure and inside is a piece of paper with the complete analytical data I was really very excited and especially because I was not expecting a present we're always taught metals in the same group of the periodic table like manganese and rhenium are very similar so I was expecting that the salts of rhenium would be very similar to the salts of manganese but I was really surprised when I was told that the company also supplied a salt per renate so I already knew that the manganese salt permanganate had this terrific purple color so here you can see it dissolved in water and next to it you can see the solid that's almost black so these are manganese salts so I was expecting a terrific color from the rhenium salt and the rhenium salt is a really boring white this is per renate with rhenium in it and the reason why it's white which I understood afterwards is because the color comes from the energy of the electrons in the iron and in rhenium the difference in energy between the different levels for the electron is much bigger so instead of absorbing visible light and looking colored it absorbs ultraviolet light which we don't notice so big disappointment Perrine 8 is white rhenium in recent years has become an extremely important element for making aircraft engine particularly jet engines and aircraft and at the same time as giving me this sample of rhenium I was given this object here this is a turbine blade from the front end of a really quite sophisticated jet engine now it's a used turbine blade and you can see there's a large slot has been cut in it to stop people selling this used blade to be put back into jet engines so this is right in the middle of the engine just after the combustion chamber where the fuel has burnt so the temperature is very high and this is spinning round very fast so there are enormous stresses on this metal the temperature is probably about 1,600 degrees centigrade or even higher and most metals were just melt or they would become so floppy they would stretch as they spun round and this is made from a special alloy which has quite a lot of nickel in it but the magic ingredient is rhenium that makes it stronger but what I find particularly surprising about this is that this whole blade is a single crystal of metal because if you have a lump of metal the weak part is between the different crystals that make up the lump but if you grow a single crystal it has no weaknesses and it's very very much stronger so this is an amazing piece of engineering because if you look closely you can see it's Hollow so they have grown a single crystal which has a hole inside so they can blow air through it to keep it cool to stop it getting quite as hot as it might do otherwise and so the lamp of rhenium that I was given actually came from recycled turbine blades because really is quite a rare element and once you put them in the turbine blades when you service the engine you get the turbine blades back and you can recycle the rhenium metal and if we didn't do that it would soon run out because there aren't very large supplies of rhenium in the longer term rhenium may have quite useful applications in a variety of solar cells and perhaps as catalysts for splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen but at the moment the major technical application is in making these special alloys it is called rhenium because it was discovered in Germany and the rhenium is derived from the

{"page": 51, "lesson": 11, "title": "Erbium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/nHrnRJXq", "transcript": {"en": "Lovely! I’ve just realised that erbium is the most\ncrucial element for the internet of all the elements on the periodic table,\nand so I want to take you across to materials engineering where we can\nsee a demonstration which will explain to you why it’s so important,\nand why without erbium many of you couldn’t be watching this video. Erbium is another lanthanide metal. It’s\nsoft, silvery, quite malleable, very reactive towards oxygen and water and,\nI suppose, for us right now it’s quite significant, because it was originally\ndiscovered from a mineral which was found in this quarry. So we’re\nin a quarry in Sweden near Stockholm, called Ytterby Mine and some black\nminerals that were found in this quarry actually were the birthplace\nfor four new chemical elements and erbium was one of them. Erbium is a photographic filter and it is\nactually a nuclear poison. What that means is that it will kill dead any nuclear\nfission process so it’s obviously got some applications there. It’s\nan interesting element when you make compounds of it and dissolve it in\nsolution it often goes pink. Now this is some erbium trichloride. You’ll\nnotice it’s very slightly pink. I think this is one of the ones that, because\nof its pink colourations, get’s used in jewellery and things like sunglasses\nand things like that, if memory serves. More recently erbium is used as an amplifier\nof light as it’s transmitted down optical fibres. So, the reason we are here, and why I’m\nall dressed up, these are the fibres that transmit the signals for the internet.\nNow the reason they use fibres is because copper cables which you\nwould normally use for electrical signals cannot carry nearly as\nmuch information, as many YouTube viewings at once, as one of these\nfibres. And the fibre is very strong, neither Brady nor I have managed to\nbreak it, and the problem is that even with this fibre, with the light\nbeam going down it, eventually the light gets weaker and weaker and you lose\nthe signal. So every 50km, every 30 miles or so, down the fibre\nwhen it’s under the sea you have to amplify the signal to get it back\nup again so that our YouTube video can reach the other side of the Atlantic\nor to India or wherever. And so the way you’ve got to do it you’ve\ngot to somehow amplify the light, make it more intense, and you can do\nthis with erbium because if you put erbium into the glass then if you\nshine a light onto the erbium atoms they get excited and then as the light\ncomes in from the signal it interacts with the erbium atom and the erbium\natom loses its energy and gives out more light. So essentially the light\ncomes in and comes out twice as intense. It then keeps going another\n30 miles and you repeat it. Here we’ve got the infrared laser, I used\nto work with lasers, but I’ve rather given up now. So it’s quite nostalgic.\nIs it switched on? And if you put this in the laser beam you can see there’s\na special screen here, which will actually take an infrared laser\nbeam which you can’t see and make it into visible light so you can see\nit. We’ve got infrared light going into a piece of glass with erbium in it. Now,\nwhat is happening here is the physics here is slightly different from what\nhappens in the amplifier, but is really quite fun because the light beam\nthat you can’t see is suddenly being changed into visible light, to green\nlight, which you can. Yes it’s very important, I had heard about\nit in lectures but when we videoed our first video about erbium I had\ncompletely forgotten about this, although without it nobody would have\nseen any of our videos. Welders, people that join pieces of metal\ntogether using either large electric fields or extreme temperatures have\nspecial masks to protect their eyes from the very bright light which\nis given out in the welding process. Welding goggles typically can include\nerbium salts because they are intense and they absorb a massive amount\nof the light so the eyes of the welder are not damaged at all. So, under the sea you have these fibres with\ncopper wires going next to it carrying the currents for the diodes that\nexcite the amplifiers all the way along and, apparently, the current going\ndown these wires is quite attractive to sharks and so in shallow water\nsharks come along and see the cable and it seems attractive and they\nstart chewing it and, although Brady and I can’t break the fibres, a shark\nin full spate can easily cut through it and so there have been quite alot\nof problems with the optic fibres in shallow water being chewed to bits\nby sharks."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is usually the color of erbium compounds in solution, such as the erbium trichloride we saw in Stephen's lab?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Green"}, {"label": "B", "text": "White"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pink"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 51, "lesson": 12, "title": "Nobelium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/a1bxDwKe", "transcript": {"en": "I think the reason that this  compound, this element, Nobelium was named after Nobel, is because Nobel  is perhaps the single most famous name  that is associated with science. Most of the people that you talk to  in the street, have probably heard of Nobel,  but they may not easily have heard  of Seaborg, or some these other people.  So I think, as a name for an  element, it is really quite a good one. Alfred Nobel was a Swedish chemist,  or industrial chemist, who worked on explosives, and the problem  with explosives, which are compounds  of Carbon and Nitrogen,  is that until the time of Alfred Nobel,  they were very unstable. They could go off unexpectedly,  and kill people, in fact, I believe one of Nobel's relatives, might even have been his brother, was killed by a serious explosion. And the reason is that these compounds, when they starts reacting, and they're reacting  violently, the reaction builts up, the heat produced by the first bit going off,  goes on, and so on. And what Nobel discovered, his real scientific discovery,  was that if he spread this compound on to inert  material, it's just essentially sand, that it would be completely stable, you can even throw in a fire  and it won't explode. But if you use a detonator that  produces a sharp, small explosion,  that is enough to set the whole lot off. And so, this allowed people to handle explosives safely, and many of the developments in the 19th century, the expansion  of the railways,   and some of the unpleasant developments  in warfare, were all brought about by Nobel's discovery of these high explosives  that could be be stabilized. Now, the result of this was that Nobel's company became really,  very lucrative, selling these explosives, and when Nobel died, a foundation was set up, which exists to this day, to award prizes in the areas of science for outstanding science, in physics,  in medicine, and chemistry,  and economics, and peace. I think the economics may actually be given  by a sister organization. And each year the prizes announced  for really one of the exciting pieces of chemistry, that has been done in  the preceding 2 years.  Occasionally it's for something that was done just a year or two before, where everybody recognizes  straight away it was revolutionary. For example, the discovery  of C60, the molecule with 60 carbon atoms, that looks like a football, which rewarded really quite quickly.  Other prizes, you really have to wait to see how the field develops, and to see whether this discovery  really was important,  whether it really changes the field of  chemistry. - Is it every chemist's dream  to win a Nobel prize? - I suppose so, but only 3 people  can win it each year, and there are so many chemists,  that it's really something  which is almost like a lottery. In fact, some national lotteries,  it's probably easier to win the prize, so I think most chemist really aspire  to becoming members of the national  academy of sciences of their own country,  and most of them don't  think of winning the Nobel prize. -So Nobelium is perhaps best  known for the fact, that it is quite controversial in terms of its naming  So it was originally discovered  and called Nobelium  and there is another research group disputeed  these findings, they claimmed that they named it and gave a different name, then eventually,  because it has been named  as Nobelium for such a long time,  people just settled on that. - But he had nothing to do with  Nobelium.  - No no , Nobelium was first  discovered, first detected, I'm not sure how many years, but  probably nearly a century after his death.  . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCaptions by www.SubPLY.com"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where was the discovery of nobelium first announced in 1957?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Soviet Union"}, {"label": "B", "text": "United States"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sweden"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Nobelium was named after the industrialist Alfred Nobel.

In this lesson, we'll add the single experimental fact that whenever anyone measures just how fast light moves, they get the same answer: 299,792,458 meters every second, which means that when we draw light on our space-time diagram, it's world line always has to appear at the same angle. But we saw previously that speed, or equivalently world line angles, change when we look at things from other people's perspective. To explore this contradiction, let's see what happens if I start moving while I stand still and shine the laser at Tom. First, we'll need to construct the space-time diagram. Yes, that means taking all of the different panels showing the different moments in time and stacking them up. From the side, we see the world line of the laser light at its correct fixed angle, just as before. So far, so good. But that space-time diagram represents Andrew's perspective. What does it look like to me? In the last lesson, we showed how to get Tom's perspective moving all the panels along a bit until his world line is completely vertical. But look carefully at the light world line. The rearrangement of the panels means it's now tilted over too far. I'd measure light traveling faster than Andrew would. But every experiment we've ever done, and we've tried very hard, says that everyone measures light to have a fixed speed. So let's start again. In the 1900s, a clever chap named Albert Einstein worked out how to see things properly, from Tom's point of view, while still getting the speed of light right. First, we need to glue together the separate panels into one solid block. This gives us our space-time, turning space and time into one smooth, continuous material. And now, here is the trick. What you do is stretch your block of space-time along the light world line, then squash it by the same amount, but at right angles to the light world line, and abracadabra! Tom's world line has gone vertical, so this does represent the world from his point of view, but most importantly, the light world line has never changed its angle, and so light will be measured by Tom going at the correct speed. This superb trick is known as a Lorentz transformation. Yeah, more than a trick. Slice up the space-time into new panels and you have the physically correct animation. I'm stationary in the car, everything else is coming past me and the speed of light works out to be that same fixed value that we know everyone measures. On the other hand, something strange has happened. The fence posts aren't spaced a meter apart anymore, and my mom will be worried that I look a bit thin. But that's not fair. Why don't I get to look thin? I thought physics was supposed to be the same for everyone. Yes, no, it is, and you do. All that stretching and squashing of space-time has just muddled together what we used to think of separately as space and time. This particular squashing effect is known as Lorentz contraction. Okay, but I still don't look thin. No, yes, you do. Now that we know better about space-time, we should redraw what the scene looked like to me. To you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Oh but to you, I appear Lorentz contracted. Yes. Uh, well, at least it's fair. And speaking of fairness, just as space gets muddled with time, time also gets muddled with space, in an effect known as time dilation. No, at everyday speeds, such as Tom's car reaches, actually all the effects are much, much smaller than we've illustrated them. Oh, yet, careful experiments, for instance watching the behavior of tiny particles whizzing around the Large Hadron Collider confirmed that the effects are real. And now that space-time is an experimentally confirmed part of reality, we can get a bit more ambitious. What if we were to start playing with the material of space-time itself?

Voice: \"Who's there?\" Manny Brot: \"Manny Brot, private eye.\" Voice: \"What are you doing here?\" \"A pretty number sent me to find a stolen dingus.\" Voice: \"Well, to enter the cave, you must answer my riddles three.\" What was it with riddles, and why do they always come in threes? \"Is it an egg?\" \"No. Why would it be an egg?\" \"It's usually an egg.\" \"What can I hold in my hand, but has zero area?\" \"Is it a dodo egg?\" \"It's not an egg!\" I took out the rock that had nearly brained me before and gave it a hard ponder. The size of the rising bump on my conk said to me that this thing had area, and a lot of it. But what if I carved out a triangle from this side here? As any mook could see, this triangle had a quarter of the area of the full triangle. I did the same thing again with each of the smaller triangles. Again, a quarter of the remaining area -- gone. And I just kept going. After an infinite number of cuts, I was satisfied that my triangle had zero area. A bounded shape with zero area. Now, it's not often that I surprise myself, but my own two mitts had created something crazy, and new. \"Very good. (ahem) Now, show me a shape with finite area, but an infinitely long perimeter.\" \"Let me get this straight. If I want to make a snip in the border of this shape, smooth it out, and lay it on the ground ... \" \"It would go on for ... \" \"Wait 'til I'm through, and then you can talk. It would go on forever.\" \"Are you through?\" \"Yeah.\" \"So show me that shape then.\" Mmm ... I hadn't been this stuck since the Rubik's Cube fiasco of '58. All the shapes I knew had perimeters. Circles: 2πr. Triangles: sum of their sides. What's this? An angle. An angle from heaven. What if I were to pinch each side, like so. A third of the way through, just so. And do it again, and again, and again. After each pinch, the perimeter got a third longer because where there had been three line segments, now there were four. As for the area, every pinch made more triangles, that's true. But those triangles were getting smaller and smaller. You could say that the area was converging, approaching a fixed number, while the perimeter was just getting bigger and bigger, uncontrollably ballooning like an overindulgent birthday clown. After infinity pinches, flimflam, there it was: Finite area, but infinite perimeter. Now that is a piece of work. \"Oh, you're good. (ahem) Riddle three: Show me a picture that if I magnify it under my microscope, I'll keep seeing the original picture, no matter how much I zoom in.\" \"You're a strange little man.\" \"Thank you.\" I was out of ideas, so I looked at my muse, my complex Dora. Voice: \"Who's the dame?\" And then it hit me. \"She's a heart breaker, my fractal femme fatale. Will she do?\" \"Yes, she'll do just fine.\" (lightning) It was dark, and at first I thought the cave was empty, but then I noticed: the box. The dame had played me like a triangle. She had told me she wanted to go home. (Lightning) What she really wanted was to bring her home here. The fractals spread everywhere. Most of them the same no matter how deep you looked at them, like Dora's mugshot. Some had infinitely long perimeters, others were objects with no area or volume, all of them created through infinite repetition. So, you wanted to know what fractals are?

Schwartz", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/not-all-scientific-studies-are-created-equal-david-h-schwartz", "transcript": {"en": "Studies have shown that taking vitamins is good for your health and bad for your health. That newly discovered herb can improve your memory or destroy your liver. Headlines proclaim a promising new cancer treatment and never mention it again. On a daily basis, we are bombarded with attention-grabbing news, backed up by scientific studies, but what are these studies? How are they performed? And how do we know whether they're reliable? When it comes to dietary or medical information, the first thing to remember is that while studies on animals or individual cells can point the way towards further research, the only way to know how something will affect humans is through a study involving human subjects. And when it comes to human studies, the scientific gold standard is the randomized clinical trial, or RCT. The key to RCTs is that the subjects are randomly assigned to their study groups. They are often blinded to make them more rigorous. This process attempts to ensure that the only difference between the groups is the one the researchers are attempting to study. For example, when testing a new headache medication, a large pool of people with headaches would be randomly divided into two groups, one receiving the medication and another receiving a placebo. With proper randomization, the only significant overall difference between the two groups will be whether or not they received the medication, rather than other differences that could affect results. Randomized clinical trials are incredible tools, and, in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration often requires at least two to be conducted before a new drug can be marketed. But the problem is that an RCT is not possible in many cases, either because it's not practical or would require too many volunteers. In such cases, scientists use an epidemiological study, which simply observes people going about their usual behavior, rather than randomly assigning active participants to control invariable groups. Let's say we wanted to study whether an herbal ingredient on the market causes nausea. Rather than deliberately giving people something that might make them nauseated, we would find those who already take the ingredient in their everyday lives. This group is called the cohort. We would also need a comparison group of people who do not have exposure to the ingredient. And we would then compare statistics. If the rate of nausea is higher in the herbal cohort, it suggests an association between the herbal supplement and nausea. Epidemiological studies are great tools to study the health effects of almost anything, without directly interfering in people's lives or assigning them to potentially dangerous exposures. So, why can't we rely on these studies to establish causal relationships between substances and their effects on health? The problem is that even the best conducted epidemiological studies have inherent flaws. Precisely because the test subjects are not randomly assigned to their groups. For example, if the cohort in our herbal study consisted of people who took the supplement for health reasons, they may have already had higher rates of nausea than the other people in the sample. Or the cohort group could've been composed of people who shop at health food stores and have different diets or better access to healthcare. These factors that can affect results, in addition to the factor being studied, are known as confounding variables. These two major pitfalls, combined with more general dangers, such as conflicts of interest or selective use of data, can make the findings of any particular epidemiological study suspect, and a good study must go out of its way to prove that its authors have taken steps to eliminate these types of errors. But even when this has been done, the very nature of epidemiological studies, which examine differences between preexisting groups, rather than deliberately inducing changes within the same individuals, means that a single study can only demonstrate a correlation between a substance and a health outcome, rather than a true cause and effect relationship. At the end of the day, epidemiological studies have served as excellent guides to public health, alerting us to critical health hazards, such as smoking, asbestos, lead, and many more. But these were demonstrated through multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies, all pointing in the same direction. So, the next time you see a headline about a new miracle cure or the terrible danger posed by an everyday substance, try to learn more about the original study and the limitations inherent in any epidemiological study or clinical trial before jumping to conclusions."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Randomized clinical trials are considered the gold standard in determining cause and effect relationships related to human health outcomes.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A single epidemiological or observational study can demonstrate cause and effect.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Studies conducted in animals can provide us with definitive information about human health risks.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Data from multiple, well-conducted epidemiological studies pointing in the same direction can be quite informative about causes of human health risks.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "RCTs cannot always be conducted in humans due to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Limited resources"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Not practical or feasible"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Requires too many subjects"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ethical Issues (e.g. potentially dangerous substances)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/making-sense-of-a-visible-quantum-object-aaron-o-connell", "transcript": {"en": "this is a representation of your brain and your brain can be broken into two parts uh there's the left half which is The Logical side and then the right half which is the intuitive and so if we add a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere then we can plot our brain and for example this would be somebody who's completely logical this would be someone who's entirely intuitive so where would you put your brain on this scale some of us may have opted for you know one of these extremes but I think for most people in the audience your brain is something like this with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time I mean it's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything you can be logical and intuitive and so I consider myself one of these people along with most of the other experimental Quantum physicists we need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas but at the same time we um we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work how do we develop this intuition well we like to play with stuff so we go out and play with it and then we see how it acts and then we develop our intuition from from there and you know really you do the same thing so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time I mean I even sound weird to think about uh one thing being in two different places at the same time but you weren't born with this notion you developed it you know I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop he was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it and he kept falling over but I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson and that's that large things don't let you get right past him and that they stay in one place and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world unless you're a particle physicist it'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist because well they don't play with car stops they play with these little little weird particles and when they play with their particles they finally do all sorts of really weird weird things like they can fly right through walls or they can be in two different places at the same time and so they wrote down all these observations and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics and so you know that's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little tiny particles but you didn't need it to describe the the large everyday objects around us this didn't really sit well with my intuition and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often well I mean I play with them sometimes but not very often um and I've never seen them I mean nobody's ever seen a particle but this it didn't sit well with my logical side either because if everything is made up of little little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics yeah I don't see any reason why it shouldn't and so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics so a few years ago I set off to do just that so I I made one this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical Quantum superp position so we're looking at here is a tiny computer chip and you can sort of see this Green Dot right in the middle and that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute this is a photograph of of the object and here I'm zoom in a little bit we're looking right there in the center and then here's a really really big closeup of the little piece of metal so what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal and it's shaped like a diving board and sticking out over a ledge and so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make computer chip I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours for the last step I had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device this device has the ability to be in a Quantum superp position but it needs a little help to do it here let me give you an analogy you know how comfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator I mean when I'm in elevator all alone I like do all sorts of weird things but then other people uh get on board bored and I stopped doing those things cuz I don't want to bother them or frankly scare them so quantum mechanics quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people but it's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the Heat of the room and so we knew if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave Quantum mechanically we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers and so that's what we did we turned the lights and then we put it in vacuum and sucked out all the air and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero now all alone in the elevator the little chunk of metal was free to act however it wanted and so we measured its motion we found it was moving in really weird ways instead of just sitting perfectly still it was vibrating and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this like expanding and Contracting Bellows and by giving it a gentle nudge we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics so what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time so let's think about the atoms so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are just sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down now it's only at precise times when they align the rest of of the time they're delocalized so that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places I think this is really cool really it was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years um cuz check this out the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as a difference between that chunk of metal and you so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time that chunk of metal can be in two different places then then why not you I mean this is just my logical side talking so imagine if you were in multiple places at the same time what would that be like it's how would your Consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space there's one more part to the story is when we warmed it up and um we turned on the lights and looked inside the Box we saw that the piece of metal was still there in one piece and so you know I had to develop this new intuition that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just Quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected well that's not quite right it's actually it's more than that and it's deeper it's that those connections your connections to all the things around you literally Define who you are and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics thank you"}, "multiple-choice":

But this wasn't a stroke of luck. Before they had crossed halfway, the water returned in a wave higher\nthan anyone had ever seen, drowning the attackers. The Potiidaeans believed\nthey had been saved by the wrath of Poseidon. But what really saved them was likely the same phenomenon\nthat has destroyed countless others: a tsunami. Although tsunamis are commonly\nknown as tidal waves, they're actually unrelated\nto the tidal activity caused by the gravitational forces\nof the Sun and Moon. In many ways, tsunamis are just\nlarger versions of regular waves. They have a trough and a crest, and consist not of moving water, but the movement of energy through water. The difference is\nin where this energy comes from. For normal ocean waves,\nit comes from wind. Because this only affects the surface,\nthe waves are limited in size and speed. But tsunamis are caused by energy\noriginating underwater, from a volcanic eruption, a submarine landslide, or most commonly,\nan earthquake on the ocean floor caused when the tectonic plates\nof the Earth's surface slip, releasing a massive amount\nof energy into the water. This energy travels up to the surface, displacing water and raising it above\nthe normal sea level, but gravity pulls it back down, which makes the energy ripple\noutwards horizontally. Thus, the tsunami is born, moving at over 500 miles per hour. When it's far from shore,\na tsunami can be barely detectable since it moves through\nthe entire depth of the water. But when it reaches shallow water,\nsomething called wave shoaling occurs. Because there is less water\nto move through, this still massive amount\nof energy is compressed. The wave's speed slows down, while its height rises\nto as much as 100 feet. The word tsunami,\nJapanese for \"harbor wave,\" comes from the fact that it only seems\nto appear near the coast. If the trough of a tsunami\nreaches shore first, the water will withdraw\nfarther than normal before the wave hits, which can be misleadingly dangerous. A tsunami will not only drown\npeople near the coast, but level buildings and trees\nfor a mile inland or more, especially in low-lying areas. As if that weren't enough,\nthe water then retreats, dragging with it the newly created debris, and anything, or anyone,\nunfortunate enough to be caught in its path. The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was one of the deadliest\nnatural disasters in history, killing over 200,000 people\nthroughout South Asia. So how can we protect ourselves\nagainst this destructive force of nature? People in some areas have attempted to stop tsunamis\nwith sea walls, flood gates, and channels to divert the water. But these are not always effective. In 2011, a tsunami\nsurpassed the flood wall protecting Japan's Fukushima Power Plant, causing a nuclear disaster in addition to claiming over 18,000 lives. Many scientists and policy makers\nare instead focusing on early detection, monitoring underwater pressure\nand seismic activity, and establishing global\ncommunication networks for quickly distributing alerts.

Iodine is this beautifully-coloured element.\nIt has this beautiful purple colour. If you put it in solution, the colour\nof the solution varies depending what you dissolve it in. If you\ndissolve it in water, itís a sort-of dirty brown colour. If you dissolve it in\nan organic material like chloroform or carbon tetrachloride it is a\nbeautiful purple colour. Iodine is halide, a halogen element from the\nfar right-hand side of the periodic table and it's strongly oxidising\nin nature. Likes to nick electrons off other atoms, so what weíre going to do\nis we are going to do a reaction with iodine, and today weíve ground\nsome iodine. So itís normally found from chemical suppliers as\nreally nice large crystals. But what we want to do as a reaction with it,\nwell we need to make sure that the surface area of the iodine is really,\nreally large so that all of it can react very very quickly with the other component. Iodine also occurs quite widely in nature\nand is absolutely essential to life. If you donít have iodine, your thyroid\ngland, which is a small gland that controls development of all sorts of\nthings in your body, doesnít operate properly. Nowadays, iodide is added\nto table salt in countries like the UK and most other developed countries\nso nearly everybody has enough iodine. In the old days iodine had\nto be got from the environment and usually from the spray from\nthe sea that was blown across the land, and so in Nottingham, which\nis really near the centre of England a long way from the sea, or relatively\nlong way from the sea, there were serious illnesses caused by people\nnot having enough iodine. So-called goiter, which caused a swelling,\nthe thyroid gland gets bigger, and this used to be called Derbyshire neck\nthis unpleasant illness, because it happened in this area of Nottingham\nand Derbyshire. So what weíre going to do is that we are\ngoing to mix it now with another element and that element is aluminium.\nSo aluminium has electrons to give away. Iodineís gonna nab\nëem. Going to see some oxidation chemistry in the formation of a\nnew compound, which is aluminium triiodide. Itís a really nice chemical\nreaction. But the way that we do it is that we mix the two together and\nwe have to add water which acts a bit like solvent and also the oxygen\nin the water activates the iodine so that it becomes more strongly oxidising\nand then hopefully weíll see the new reaction. So Iím going to just\nput some out into this small vessel. You can see this development effect of iodine\nreally well that if you had tadpoles, baby frogs, they donít develop\ntheir legs and turn into frogs unless there is iodine in the water. The other component in this reaction is aluminium,\nok; and weíre using very, very finely powdered aluminium. Not\nfoil or not a rather large lump. This has been especially powdered for\nus, so again it has a very, very high surface area. One of my favourite chemical equations is\nëtadpoles plus iodine goes to frogsí. So you can see the aluminium and\nthe iodine mixed within this solid mixture. Now still, these two components,\nthese two elements they are still held away from one another they\ncanít react. So what we need to do is add a small amount of water, which\nactually acts like a solvent but actually activates the iodine and then\nweíll wait and see what happens with the chemical reaction. Iodine can be used as a disinfectant, in fact\nchlorine can be as well, but solution of iodine is often used when people\nhave cuts. So if you cut yourself, fortunately I havenít any cuts\nat the moment, you can paint on iodine and because of its rather red colour\nit made cuts often look much worse. Children would come home from school\nand their whole hand would be red and this would cause some excitement\nat home but it is quite an effective antiseptic. Water: just take a small amount and add it\nto the reaction. So you can see itís starting to go now the chemical\nreaction because we are seeing the excess iodine subliming in the form of\na vapour. Now if we go in close we can hear it fizzing because this\nis actually an oxidation reaction and the formation of the new aluminium triiodide.\nNow Iím going to just mix this slightly to try and increase the\nrate of the chemical reaction slightly. So now you can see the reactionís\nreally going and itís really exothermic, weíre forming aluminium triiodide,\nand the exotherm is actually heating and starting to sublime off\nthe excess iodine which you can see coming off as this really nice purple\nplume. Now deep inside the reaction now you can see the exothermic or\nthe energy coming out and starting to cause a flame. Really, really\nnice, really rapid chemical reaction: really beautiful. So weíre forming\naluminium triiodide here which again is a very, very delicate compound;\nquite reactive in itself. So you can see now the really nice new crystalline\nmaterial. So, sadly, weíve managed to stain Stigís fume cupboard.\nAll of this really nice iodine forming a very fine layer across this\nfume cupboard. What do you think about that? Looks like a thorough cleaning job coming\nto be honest."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What are the beautiful purple plumes we can see released from the vessel in Pete's experiment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Aluminium triiodide"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Excess iodine vapor"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Steam"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which gland in your body needs iodine to function properly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pineal gland"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pancreas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thyroid gland"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Tellurium. You’ve never had anything to do with this? Nothing to do with it in my life. So this\nis a new one for me. This is tellurium powder. So let’s see what’s\ninside the vial. So as we open it and tap out the glass vial. This one is going\nto be stubborn. This bell shape here is a sample of tellurium.\nThe reason…shall I hold it for you? … so, a sample of tellurium. I’m\nslightly cagey about touching this because as I think I explained with selenium\nthat, if you ingest tellurium into the body it can get into your sweat and make\nyou smell enough to really drive people mad. And these crystals like\nthis one can be cut up and mounted into a piece of apparatus like this. So a chemist won’t deal with all the elements\non the periodic table in his career normally. No, no, very few chemists will deal with more\nthan perhaps a handful of different elements. So this is\nthe tellurium and this is, again, this is very high standard material. 3 grams\nof the tellurium material and you can see it’s a very dark powder at the\nbottom of the vial. It was used in this piece of apparatus to\nshine in an infrared laser that’s like a heat ray at one frequency and it came\nout as twice the frequency. So you can use it to change the effect of\nthe lasers. Unfortunately the guy doing it didn’t make a very good job\nof it and you can see he’s completely burnt the surface of this piece\nof tellurium.
