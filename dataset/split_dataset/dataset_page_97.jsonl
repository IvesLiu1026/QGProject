Among the hardest patterns\nwe've tried to understand is the concept of\nturbulent flow in fluid dynamics. The German physicist\nWerner Heisenberg said, \"When I meet God,\nI'm going to ask him two questions: why relativity and why turbulence? I really believe he will have\nan answer for the first.\" As difficult as turbulence is\nto understand mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. In June 1889, Vincent van Gogh\npainted the view just before sunrise from the window of his room\nat the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he'd admitted himself after\nmutilating his own ear in a psychotic episode. In \"The Starry Night,\"\nhis circular brushstrokes create a night sky filled\nwith swirling clouds and eddies of stars. Van Gogh and other Impressionists\nrepresented light in a different way than their predecessors, seeming to capture\nits motion, for instance, across sun-dappled waters, or here in star light\nthat twinkles and melts through milky waves of blue night sky. The effect is caused by luminance, the intensity of the light\nin the colors on the canvas. The more primitive part\nof our visual cortex, which sees light contrast\nand motion, but not color, will blend two differently\ncolored areas together if they have the same luminance. But our brains' primate subdivision will see the contrasting colors\nwithout blending. With these two interpretations\nhappening at once, the light in many Impressionist works\nseems to pulse, flicker and radiate oddly. That's how this\nand other Impressionist works use quickly executed\nprominent brushstrokes to capture something strikingly real\nabout how light moves. Sixty years later, Russian\nmathematician Andrey Kolmogorov furthered our mathematical\nunderstanding of turbulence when he proposed that energy\nin a turbulent fluid at length R varies in proportion to\nthe 5/3rds power of R. Experimental measurements show Kolmogorov was remarkably close\nto the way turbulent flow works, although a complete description\nof turbulence remains one of the unsolved\nproblems in physics. A turbulent flow is self-similar\nif there is an energy cascade. In other words, big eddies\ntransfer their energy to smaller eddies, which do likewise at other scales. Examples of this include\nJupiter's Great Red Spot, cloud formations\nand interstellar dust particles. In 2004, using the Hubble Space Telescope, scientists saw the eddies of a distant\ncloud of dust and gas around a star, and it reminded them\nof Van Gogh's \"Starry Night.\" This motivated scientists\nfrom Mexico, Spain and England to study the luminance\nin Van Gogh's paintings in detail. They discovered that there is a distinct\npattern of turbulent fluid structures close to Kolmogorov's equation\nhidden in many of Van Gogh's paintings. The researchers digitized the paintings, and measured how brightness varies\nbetween any two pixels. From the curves measured\nfor pixel separations, they concluded that paintings from\nVan Gogh's period of psychotic agitation behave remarkably similar\nto fluid turbulence. His self-portrait with a pipe, from\na calmer period in Van Gogh's life, showed no sign of this correspondence. And neither did other artists' work that seemed equally\nturbulent at first glance, like Munch's \"The Scream.\" While it's too easy to say\nVan Gogh's turbulent genius enabled him to depict turbulence, it's also far too difficult to accurately\nexpress the rousing beauty of the fact that in a period of intense suffering, Van Gogh was somehow\nable to perceive and represent one of the most supremely\ndifficult concepts nature has ever brought before mankind, and to unite his unique mind's eye with the deepest mysteries\nof movement, fluid and light."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where was Vincent van Gogh located when he painted \"Starry Night\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "In Paris"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In an asylum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In a church"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In a university"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Who proposed statistical theory of turbulent patterns?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A.

Since ancient times, \nmankind has hotly debated whether mathematics \nwas discovered or invented. Did we create mathematical concepts to\nhelp us understand the universe around us, or is math the native language of\nthe universe itself, existing whether we find \nits truths or not? Are numbers, polygons \nand equations truly real, or merely ethereal representations\nof some theoretical ideal? The independent reality of math has\nsome ancient advocates. The Pythagoreans of 5th Century Greece\nbelieved numbers were both living entities and universal principles. They called the number one, \"the monad,\"\nthe generator of all other numbers and source of all creation. Numbers were active agents in nature. Plato argued mathematical \nconcepts were concrete and as real as the universe itself,\nregardless of our knowledge of them. Euclid, the father of geometry, believed\nnature itself was the physical manifestation\nof mathematical laws. Others argue that while numbers may\nor may not exist physically, mathematical statements definitely don't. Their truth values are based on rules\nthat humans created. Mathematics is thus an invented\nlogic exercise, with no existence outside mankind's\nconscious thought, a language of abstract relationships\nbased on patterns discerned by brains, built to use those patterns to invent\nuseful but artificial order from chaos. One proponent of this sort of idea\nwas Leopold Kronecker, a professor of mathematics in \n19th century Germany. His belief is summed up in \nhis famous statement: \"God created the natural numbers,\nall else is the work of man.\" During mathematician\nDavid Hilbert's lifetime, there was a push to establish mathematics\nas a logical construct. Hilbert attempted to axiomatize all\nof mathematics, as Euclid had done with geometry. He and others who attempted this saw\nmathematics as a deeply philosophical game but a game nonetheless. Henri Poincaré, one of the father's of\nnon-Euclidean geometry, believed that the existence of \nnon-Euclidean geometry, dealing with the non-flat surfaces of \nhyperbolic and elliptical curvatures, proved that Euclidean geometry, the\nlong standing geometry of flat surfaces, was not a universal truth, but rather one outcome of using one\nparticular set of game rules. But in 1960, Nobel Physics laureate\nEugene Wigner coined the phrase, \"the unreasonable \neffectiveness of mathematics,\" pushing strongly for the idea that\nmathematics is real and discovered by people. Wigner pointed out that many purely\nmathematical theories developed in a vacuum, often with no view\ntowards describing any physical phenomena, have proven decades \nor even centuries later, to be the framework necessary to explain how the universe\nhas been working all along. For instance, the number theory of British\nmathematician Gottfried Hardy, who had boasted that none of his work\nwould ever be found useful in describing any phenomena\nin the real world, helped establish cryptography. Another piece of his purely\ntheoretical work became known as the Hardy-Weinberg\nlaw in genetics, and won a Nobel prize. And Fibonacci stumbled \nupon his famous sequence while looking at the growth of an \nidealized rabbit population. Mankind later found the sequence\neverywhere in nature, from sunflower seeds\nand flower petal arrangements, to the structure of a pineapple, even the branching of bronchi\nin the lungs. Or there's the non-Euclidean work of\nBernhard Riemann in the 1850s, which Einstein used in the model for\ngeneral relativity a century later. Here's an even bigger jump: mathematical knot theory, first developed\naround 1771 to describe the geometry of position, was used in the late 20th century\nto explain how DNA unravels itself during the replication process. It may even provide key explanations\nfor string theory. Some of the most influential \nmathematicians and scientists of all of human history\nhave chimed in on the issue as well, often in surprising ways. So, is mathematics an \ninvention or a discovery? Artificial construct or\nuniversal truth? Human product or\nnatural, possibly divine, creation? These questions are so deep the debate\noften becomes spiritual in nature. The answer might depend on the specific\nconcept being looked at, but it can all feel like a\ndistorted zen koan.

Even the ticking of a clock itself\nis a sort of rhythm. But for musical rhythm, a steady string of repeating single\nbeats is not enough. For that, we need at least one opposing\nbeat with a different sound, which can be the unstressed off beat\nor the accented back beat. There are several ways to make\nthese beats distinct, whether by using high and low drums,\nor long and short beats. Which ends up being heard as the main\nbeat is not a precise rule, but like the famous Rubin's vase, can be\nreversed depending on cultural perception. In standard notation, rhythm is indicated\non a musical bar line, but there are other ways. Remember that ticking clock? Just as its round face can trace the\nlinear passage of time, the flow of rhythm can be \ntraced in a circle. The continuity of a wheel can be\na more intuitive way to visualize rhythm than a linear score that requires moving\nback and forth along the page. We can mark the beats at different\npositions around the circle using blue dots for main beats,\norange ones for off beats, and white dots for secondary beats. Here is a basic two beat rhythm with\na main beat and an opposing off beat. Or a three beat rhythm with a main beat,\nan off beat, and a secondary beat. And the spaces between each beat\ncan be divided into further sub-beats using multiples of either two or three. Layering multiple patterns using\nconcentric wheels lets us create more complex rhythms. For example, we can combine a basic \ntwo beat rhythm with off beats to get a four beat system. This is the recognizable backbone of\nmany genres popular around the world, from rock, country, and jazz, to reggae and cumbia. Or we can combine a two beat\nrhythm with a three beat one. Eliminating the extra main beat\nand rotating the inner wheel leaves us with a rhythm whose \nunderlying feel is three-four. This is the basis of the music of\nWhirling Dervishes, as well as a broad range of \nLatin American rhythms, such as Joropo, and even Bach's famous Chaconne. Now if we remember Rubin's vase\nand hear the off beats as the main beats, this will give us a six-eight feel, as found in genres such as Chacarera, and Quechua, Persian music and more. In an eight beat system,\nwe have three layered circles, each rhythm played by \na different instrument. We can then add an outermost layer consisting of an additive \nrhythmic component, reinforcing the main beat\nand increasing accuracy. Now let's remove everything\nexcept for this combined rhythm and the basic two beat on top. This rhythmic configuration is found\nas the Cuban cinquillo, in the Puerto Rican bomba, and in Northern Romanian music. And rotating the outer circle\n90 degrees counterclockwise gives us a pattern often found\nin Middle Eastern music, as well as Brazilian choro, and Argentinian tango. In all of these examples, the underlying\nrhythm reinforces the basic one-two, but in different ways depending on \narrangement and cultural context. So it turns out that the wheel method\nis more than just a nifty way of visualizing complex rhythms. By freeing us from the tyranny\nof the bar line, we can visualize rhythm \nin terms of time, and a simple turn of the wheel can take us\non a musical journey around the world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A rhythm requires:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A beat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A measured, continuous series of beat"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A distinguishable offbeat or backbeat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Any series of beats"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The main tools of rhythm construction we use are:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Additive and divisive"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Additive and multiplicative"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Subtractive and divisive"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Subtractive and multiplicative"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Rhythm wheels sets:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Are fixed for certain numbers of beats"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Can be rotated freely around a common center"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Can be rotated within the constraints of the number of beats"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Show all the places where beats should be played"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The number of layers in a rhythm wheel usually:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Is a maximum of three"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Can be any number"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Corresponds to the number of beats in the cycle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Depends on the number of instruments being used"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The rhythms of which of following groups share a common rhythm wheel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Chacarera, whirling dervish, American soul music"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cuban son, Colombian cumbión, joropo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Brazilian chôro, Argentinian tango, Persian 6/8"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Joropo, Persian 6/8, chaconne"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

If you look up at the patches of\nmurk between buildings, you might be able to pick out\nThe Big Dipper, or perhaps, Orion's Belt. But hold on.  Look at that murky patch again\nand hold our your thumb. How many stars do you think\nare behind it? Ten, twenty? Guess again. If you looked at that\nthumbnail-sized patch of sky with the Hubble Space Telescope, instead of points of light,\nyou'd see smudges. These aren't stars. They're galaxies, just like our Milky Way. Cities of billions of stars, and more than 1,000 of them\nare hidden behind your thumb. The universe is bigger than\nyou can see from the city, and even bigger than the starry sky\nyou can see from the countryside. This is the universe as \nastrophysicists see it, with more stars than all the grains\nof sand on Earth. By staring up at the stars at night, you've taken part in the oldest science\nin human history. The study of the heavens is older than navigation, agriculture, perhaps\neven language itself. Yet unlike other sciences,\nastronomy is purely observational. We cannot control the parameters\nof our experiments from lab benches. Our best technology can send\nman to the moon, and probes to the edge of \nthe solar system. But these distances are vanishingly small compared to the yawning gulfs \nbetween stars. So how can we know so much\nabout other galaxies, what they're made of, how many there are,\nor that they're even there at all? Well, we can start with the first thing we\nsee when we look up at night: the stars. What we are trying to learn\nis their properties. What are they made of? How hot are they?\nHow massive? How old? How far are they from Earth? And believe it or not, we can learn all of these things\nsimply from the light shining in the sky. We can decipher one kind of stellar message\nby turning starlight into rainbows. When you look at a rainbow on Earth, you're really looking at light\nfrom our Sun being scattered through water droplets\nin the atmosphere into all the different wavelengths\nthat make it up. And we study the light from other stars, we can create rainbows on demand\nusing not water droplets, but other specific instruments that\ndisperse light. When we look at the scattered\nlight from our sun, we see something strange:\ndark lines in our rainbow. These lines are the characteristic\nfingerprints of atoms. Each type of atom in the solar atmosphere\nsoaks up light at specific wavelengths, and the amount of absorption depends on\nhow many of these atoms there are. So by observing how much light is missing\nat these characteristic wavelengths, we can tell not only what elements are\nin the Sun's atmosphere, but even their concentrations. And the same idea can be applied to\nstudy other stars. Make a spectral rainbow, \nsee what's missing, and figure out which elements are present. Bingo. Now you know what stars\nare made of. But we aren't restricted to just\nthe wavelengths that our eyes perceive. Consider radio waves. Yes, they can bring the Billboard Top 100\nto your car, but they can also travel almost\nunimpeded through space. Because they've come so far, radio waves can tell us the very\nearly history of the universe, from just a few thousand years\nafter The Big Bang. We can also study the infrared light,\nemitted by colder objects, like the gas and dust clouds in space, and the ultraviolet light from the hot\nstars recently born from those clouds. Studying different wavelengths \nnot only gives us a more complete picture\nof any single object but also different views of the universe. For this reason, astrophysicists use\nseveral different kinds of telescopes covering the spectrum from the infrared\nto the ultraviolet to the X-ray, from giant radio dishes to giant\nsilver mirrors to space satellites, detecting light that would be otherwise\nblocked by the Earth's atmosphere. Astrophysicists don't just see the billions of stars among\nthe billions of galaxies in the universe. They hear, feel and sense them\nthrough many channels, each revealing a different story.

And, take a moment to think,\nhow many times have you listened to it? Chances are you've heard that chorus\nrepeated dozens, if not hundreds, of times, and it's not just popular songs in the West\nthat repeat a lot. Repetition is a feature that music from\ncultures around the world tends to share. So, why does music rely\nso heavily on repetition? One part of the answer come from what\npsychologists call the mere-exposure effect. In short, people tend to prefer things\nthey've been exposed to before. For example, a song comes on the radio\nthat we don't particularly like, but then we hear the song at\nthe grocery store, at the movie theater and again on the street corner. Soon, we are tapping to the beat,\nsinging the words, even downloading the track. This mere-exposure effect doesn't\njust work for songs. It also works for everything \nfrom shapes to Super Bowl ads. So, what makes repetition so\nuniquely prevalent in music? To investigate, psychologists asked\npeople to listen to musical compositions that avoided exact repetition. They heard excerpts from these pieces\nin either their original form, or in a version that had been digitally\naltered to include repetition. Although the original versions\nhad been composed by some of the most respected \n20th century composers, and the repetitive versions had been\nassembled by brute force audio editing, people rated the repetitive versions\nas more enjoyable, more interesting and more likely to have been\ncomposed by a human artist. Musical repetition is deeply compelling. Think about the Muppets classic,\n\"Mahna Mahna.\" If you've heard it before, it's almost impossible after I sing,\n\"Mahna mahna,\" not to respond, \"Do doo do do do.\" Repetition connects each bit of music irresistibly to the next bit \nof music that follows it. So when you hear a few notes,\nyou're already imagining what's coming next. Your mind is unconsciously singing along, and without noticing,\nyou might start humming out loud. Recent studies have shown that when\npeople hear a segment of music repeated, they are more likely to move\nor tap along to it. Repetition invites us into music\nas imagined participants, rather than as passive listeners. Research has also shown that listeners shift their attention\nacross musical repetitions, focusing on different aspects of\nthe sound on each new listen. You might notice the melody\nof a phrase the first time, but when it's repeated, your attention\nshifts to how the guitarist bends a pitch. This also occurs in language,\nwith something called semantic satiation. Repeating a word like atlas ad nauseam can make you stop thinking about \nwhat the word means, and instead focus on the sounds:\nthe odd way the \"L\" follows the \"T.\" In this way, repetition can \nopen up new worlds of sound not accessible on first hearing. The \"L\" following the \"T\" might not be\naesthetically relevant to \"atlas,\" but the guitarist pitch bending\nmight be of critical expressive importance. The speech to song illusion\ncaptures how simply repeating a sentence a number of times\nshifts listeners attention to the pitch and temporal\naspects of the sound, so that the repeated spoken language actually begins to sound\nlike it is being sung. A similar effect happens with \nrandom sequences of sound. People will rate random sequences\nthey've heard on repeated loop as more musical than a random\nsequence they've only heard once. Repetition gives rise to a kind of\norientation to sound that we think of as distinctively musical,\nwhere we're listening along with the sound, engaging imaginatively with the note\nabout to happen. This mode of listening ties in with our\nsusceptibility to musical ear worms, where segments of music\nburrow into our head, and play again and again,\nas if stuck on repeat. Critics are often embarrassed\nby music's repetitiveness, finding it childish or regressive, but repetition, far from an embarrassment,\nis actually a key feature that gives rise to the kind of experience\nwe think about as musical."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The mere exposure effect captures the intution that", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exposure isn't strong enough to affect preference"}, {"label": "B", "text": "People tend to dislike stimuli they've encountered before"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People tend to prefer stimuli they've encountered before"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Exposure is the only fact affecting preference"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When repetition was added to excerpts from challenging contemporary art music:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Listeners found the music more enjoyable, interesting, and artistic"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Listeners found the music more unpleasant, boring, and random"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Listeners found the music as enjoyable, interesting, and artistic as they had originally"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Listeners noticed that repetition had been added"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When people hear a segment of music repeated:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They're more likely to turn off the track"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They're more likely to relax"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They're more likely to turn up the track"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They're more likely to move along while listening"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The semantic satiation effect refers to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The shift in feelings about a word's semantic meaning after it's been repeated many times"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The shift in ability to pronounce a word after it's been repeated many times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The shift in attention from a word's meaning to a word's sounds after it's been repeated many times"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The shift in attention from a word's sounds to a word's meaning after it's been repeated many times"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "After you've head a piece repeated a lot:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "You're able to anticipate what note is coming next"}, {"label": "B", "text": "You're able to compose it yourself"}, {"label": "C", "text": "You're able to explain it to someone else"}, {"label": "D", "text": "You're able to title it accurately"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Its early symptoms, which include increased thirst\nand large volumes of urine, were recognized as far back\nas 1500 BCE in Egypt. While the term diabetes,\nmeaning \"to pass through,\" was first used in 250 BCE by the Greek physician\nApollonius of Memphis, Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, associated respectively\nwith youth and obesity, were identified as separate conditions by Indian physicians\nsomewhere in the 5th century CE. But despite the disease being known, a diagnosis of diabetes in a human patient would remain tantamount\nto a death sentence until the early 20th century,\nits causes unknown. What changed this dire situation was the help of humanity's\nlongtime animal partner: Canis lupus familiaris, domesticated from Grey wolves\nthousands of years ago. In 1890, the German scientists\nVon Mering and Minkowski demonstrated that removing\na dog's pancreas caused it to develop\nall the signs of diabetes, thus establishing the organ's\ncentral role in the disease. But the exact mechanism\nby which this occurred remained a mystery until 1920, when a young Canadian surgeon\nnamed Frederick Banting and his student, Charles Best, advanced the findings\nof their German colleagues. Working under Professor Macleod\nat the University of Toronto, they confirmed that the pancreas was\nresponsible for regulating blood glucose, successfully treating diabetic dogs\nby injecting them with an extract they had prepared from pancreas tissue. By 1922, the researchers working\nwith biochemist James Collip were able to develop a similar extract\nfrom beef pancreas to first treat a 14-year-old diabetic boy, followed by six additional patients. The manufacturing process\nfor this extract, now known as insulin, was eventually turned over\nto a pharmaceutical company that makes different types\nof injectable insulin to this day. Banting and Macleod received the Nobel Prize for Medicine\nin 1923 for their discovery. But Banting chose to share\nhis portion with Charles Best, for his help in the initial\nstudies involving dogs. But while medical experimentation\non animals remains controversial, in this case at least, it was not just a matter\nof exploiting dogs for human needs. Dogs develop diabetes at the rate\nof two cases per 1,000 dogs, almost the same\nas that of humans under 20. Most canine cases are of Type 1 diabetes, similar to the type\nthat young children develop following immune system\ndestruction of the pancreas, and genetic studies have shown that the dog disease has many\nsimilar hallmarks of the human disease. This has allowed veterinarians\nto turn the tables, successfully using insulin\nto treat diabetes in man's best friend for over 60 years. Many dog owners commit\nto managing their dogs' diabetes with insulin injected twice daily,\nregimented feedings, and periodic blood measurements using the same home-testing\nglucose monitors used by human patients. And if the purified pig insulin\ncommonly used for dogs fails to work for a particular dog, the vet may even turn\nto a formulation of human insulin, bringing the process full circle. After all that dogs have done\nfor us throughout the ages, including their role\nin a medical discovery that has saved countless human lives, using that same knowledge\nto help them is the least we could do."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Diabetes mellitus is expected to increase ____ in human patients in the next 20 years.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "20%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "100%"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which organ did German scientists remove from dogs to first re-create the signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Liver"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pancreas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spleen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stomach"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Canadian scientists Banting, Best and MacLeod first discovered that injection of a tissue extract, later shown to contain insulin, would lower blood _______ in diabetic dogs.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sodium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Biocarbonate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cortisol"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Glucose"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Dogs suffer from Type ___ diabetes mellitus at about the same rate as human patients less than 20 years old.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "I"}, {"label": "B", "text": "II"}, {"label": "C", "text": "III"}, {"label": "D", "text": "IV"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Today, when diabetic dogs cannot be successfully treated with pig insulin, veterinarians may then treat them with ____ insulin.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sheep"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Horse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Human"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Fish"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

When the wind is up \nand conditions are right, I get in my car and follow violent storms. \"Crazy,\" you say? Perhaps, but really I\nchase these sky beasts to learn about them. I want to share with you what I know. Tornadoes are rapidly rotating columns\nof air that form inside storms that connect with the ground via\na funnel of cloud. When that happens, \nthey tear across the Earth, posing a huge threat to life and property. Because of this, there's a great deal\nof research into these phenomena, but the truth is, there's still a lot\nwe don't know about how tornadoes form. The conditions that may \ngive rise to one tornado won't necessarily cause another. But we have learned a lot since\npeople first started recording tornadoes, like how to recognize the signs\nwhen one is brewing in the sky. Are you coming along for the ride? Tornadoes begin with a thunderstorm\nbut not just any thunderstorm. These are especially powerful, towering\nthunderstorms called supercells. Reaching up to over 50,000 feet,\nthey bring high force winds, giant hailstones, sometimes flooding\nand great flashes of lightning, too. These are the kinds of storms\nthat breed tornadoes, but only if there are also very\nspecific conditions in place, clues that we can measure and look out for\nwhen we're trying to forecast a storm. Rising air is the first ingredient needed\nfor a tornado to develop. Any storm is formed \nwhen condensation occurs, the byproducts of the clouds. Condensation releases heat, and heat becomes the energy that drives\nhuge upward drafts of air. The more condensation\nand the bigger the storm clouds grow, the more powerful those updrafts become. In supercells, this rising airmass \nis particularly strong. As the air climbs, it can change direction\nand start to move more quickly. Finally, at the storm's base,\nif there is a lot of moisture, a huge cloud base develops,\ngiving the tornado something to feed off later,\nif it gets that far. When all these things are in place,\na vortex can develop enclosed by the storm, and forming a wide, tall tube of spinning\nair that then gets pulled upwards. We call this a mesocyclone. Outside, cool, dry, sinking air starts to wrap around the back of\nthis mesocyclone, forming what's known as a\nrear flank downdraft. This unusual scenario creates \na stark temperature difference between the air inside the mesocyclone,\nand the air outside, building up a level of instability\nthat allows a tornado to thrive. Then, the mesocyclone's lower part\nbecomes tighter, increasing the speed of the wind. If, and that's a big if,\nthis funnel of air moves down into that large, moist cloud base\nat the bottom of the parent storm, it sucks it in and turns it \ninto a rotating wall of cloud, forming a link between \nthe storm that created it and the Earth. The second that tube of\nspinning cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most are small and short-lived,\nproducing winds of 65-110 miles per hour, but others can last for over an hour,\nproducing 200 mile per hour winds. They are beautiful but terrifying, especially if you or \nyour town is in its path. In that case, no one,\nnot even tornado chasers like me, enjoy watching thing unfold. Just like everything, however,\ntornadoes do come to an end. When the temperature difference disappears\nand conditions grow more stable, or the moisture in the air dries up, the once fierce parent storm loses\nmomentum and draws its tornado back inside. Even so, meteorologists and storm chasers\nlike me will remain on the lookout, watching, always watching to see\nif the storm releases its long rope again."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A rapidly rotating column of air that forms inside a storm is a:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hail storm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Supercell"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thunder storm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tornado"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Supercells commonly bring:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "High force winds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hailstones and lightning"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Flooding"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Specific conditions for tornadoes include:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rising air"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lots of moisture and condensation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A huge cloud base"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "More condensation means:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More heat"}, {"label": "B", "text": "More updrafts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Less heat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Both A & B"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Tornadoes will stop when:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Temperature differences disappear, moisture in the air dries up, conditions become more stable"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Temperatures differences increase, moisture in air increases, conditions are unstable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Temperature differences disappear, moisture in air increases, conditions becomes more stable"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Temperature differences increase, moisture in air dries up, and conditions are unstable"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

It's true. Microorganisms called bacteria\nwere some of the first life forms to appear on Earth. Though they consist of only a single cell, their total biomass is greater than\nthat of all plants and animals combined. And they live virtually everywhere: on the ground, in the water, on your kitchen table, on your skin, even inside you. Don't reach for the panic button just yet. Although you have 10 times\nmore bacterial cells inside you than your body has human cells, many of these bacteria\nare harmless or even beneficial, helping digestion and immunity. But there are a few bad apples\nthat can cause harmful infections, from minor inconveniences\nto deadly epidemics. Fortunately, there are amazing medicines\ndesigned to fight bacterial infections. Synthesized from chemicals or\noccurring naturally in things like mold, these antibiotics kill\nor neutralize bacteria by interrupting cell wall synthesis or interfering with vital processes\nlike protein synthesis, all while leaving human cells unharmed. The deployment of antibiotics\nover the course of the 20th century has rendered many previously\ndangerous diseases easily treatable. But today, more and more\nof our antibiotics are becoming less effective. Did something go wrong\nto make them stop working? The problem is not with the antibiotics\nbut the bacteria they were made to fight, and the reason lies in Darwin's theory\nof natural selection. Just like any other organisms, individual bacteria\ncan undergo random mutations. Many of these mutations\nare harmful or useless, but every now and then,\none comes along that gives its organism an edge in survival. And for a bacterium, a mutation making it resistant\nto a certain antibiotic gives quite the edge. As the non-resistant bacteria\nare killed off, which happens especially quickly\nin antibiotic-rich environments, like hospitals, there is more room and resources\nfor the resistant ones to thrive, passing along only the mutated genes\nthat help them do so. Reproduction\nisn't the only way to do this. Some can release their DNA upon death\nto be picked up by other bacteria, while others use a method\ncalled conjugation, connecting through pili\nto share their genes. Over time, the resistant\ngenes proliferate, creating entire strains\nof resistant super bacteria. So how much time do we have\nbefore these superbugs take over? Well, in some bacteria,\nit's already happened. For instance, some strands\nof staphylococcus aureus, which causes everything from\nskin infections to pneumonia and sepsis, have developed into MRSA, becoming resistant\nto beta-lactam antibiotics, like penicillin, methicillin,\nand oxacillin. Thanks to a gene that replaces the protein\nbeta-lactams normally target and bind to, MRSA can keep making\nits cell walls unimpeded. Other super bacteria, like salmonella, even sometimes produce enzymes\nlike beta-lactams that break down antibiotic attackers\nbefore they can do any damage, and E. coli, a diverse group of bacteria that contains strains that cause\ndiarrhea and kidney failure, can prevent the function of antibiotics, like quinolones, by actively\nbooting any invaders that manage to enter the cell. But there is good news. Scientists are working to stay\none step ahead of the bacteria, and although development\nof new antibiotics has slowed in recent years, the World Health Organization has made it\na priority to develop novel treatments. Other scientists are investigating\nalternate solutions, such as phage therapy\nor using vaccines to prevent infections. Most importantly, curbing the excessive\nand unnecessary use of antibiotics, such as for minor infections\nthat can resolve on their own, as well as changing medical practice\nto prevent hospital infections, can have a major impact by keeping more\nnon-resistant bacteria alive as competition for resistant strains.

How did it get to look like this? How will it end? Humans have been discussing these questions for as long as they've been around\nwithout ever reaching much agreement. Today, cosmologists are working hard\nto find the answers. But how can anyone hope to find\nconcrete answers to such profound questions? And how is it possible to explore and study\nsomething as huge as the universe, most of which we'll never be able to reach? The answer is light. And although light from\ndistant parts of the universe can take billions of years to reach us, it carries six unique messages\nthat, when put together, can disclose an amazing amount\nof information to astronomers who know how to look for it. Just as sunlight can be split up\ninto the familiar rainbow, splitting the light from distant objects\nexposes different patterns of colors depending on its source. This distinctive light barcode\ncan reveal not only an object's composition, but also the temperature and pressure\nof its constituent parts. There's even more we can\ndiscover from light. If you've ever stood on a train platform,\nyou might have noticed that the train sounds different \ndepending on its direction with the pitch ascending \nwhen it approaches you and descending when it speeds away. But this isn't because the train conductor\nis practicing for a second career. Rather, it's because of something\ncalled the Doppler effect where sound waves generated by\nan approaching object are compressed, while those from a receding\nobject are stretched. But what has this to do with astronomy? Sound does not travel through a vacuum.\nIn space, no one can you hear you scream! But the same Doppler effect applies to light\nwhose source is moving at exceptional speed. If it's moving towards us, \nthe shorter wavelength will make the light appear to be bluer. While light from a source\nthat's moving away will have a longer wavelength,\nshifting towards red. So by analyzing the color pattern\nin the Doppler shift of the light from any object observed with a telescope,\nwe can learn what it's made of, how hot it is and \nhow much pressure it's under, as well as whether it's moving, \nin what direction and how fast. And these six measurements,\nlike six points of light, reveal the history of the universe. The first person to study the light \nfrom distant galaxies was Edwin Hubble, and the light he observed was redshifted. The distant galaxies were \nall moving away from us, and the further away the were,\nthe faster they were receding. Hubble had discovered\nour universe is expanding, providing the first evidence\nfor the Big Bang theory. Along with the idea that the visible universe\nhas been constantly expanding from a densely packed single point, one of this theory's \nmost important predictions is that the early universe consisted\nof just two gases: hydrogen and helium, in a ratio of three to one. And this prediction can\nalso be tested with light. If we observe the light from a remote,\nquiet region of the universe and split it, we do indeed find the signatures\nof the two gases in just those proportions. Another triumph for the Big Bang. However, many puzzles remain. Although we know the\nvisible universe is expanding, gravity should be applying the brakes. But recent measurements of light\nfrom distant dying stars show us that they're farther away\nthan predicted. So the expansion of the universe\nis actually accelerating. Something appears to be pushing it, and many scientists believe\nthat something is dark energy, making up over 2/3 of the universe\nand slowly tearing it apart. Our knowledge of the behavior of matter\nand the precision of our instruments means that simply observing distant stars\ncan tell us more about the universe than we ever thought possible.

{"page": 97, "lesson": 11, "title": "How quantum mechanics explains global warming - Lieven Scheire", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-quantum-mechanics-explains-global-warming-lieven-scheire", "transcript": {"en": "You've probably heard that carbon dioxide is warming the Earth, but how does it work? Is it like the glass of a greenhouse or like an insulating blanket? Well, not entirely. The answer involves a bit of quantum mechanics, but don't worry, we'll start with a rainbow. If you look closely at sunlight separated through a prism, you'll see dark gaps where bands of color went missing. Where did they go? Before reaching our eyes, different gases absorbed those specific parts of the spectrum. For example, oxygen gas snatched up some of the dark red light, and sodium grabbed two bands of yellow. But why do these gases absorb specific colors of light? This is where we enter the quantum realm. Every atom and molecule has a set number of possible energy levels for its electrons. To shift its electrons from the ground state to a higher level, a molecule needs to gain a certain amount of energy. No more, no less. It gets that energy from light, which comes in more energy levels than you could count. Light consists of tiny particles called photons and the amount of energy in each photon corresponds to its color. Red light has lower energy and longer wavelengths. Purple light has higher energy and shorter wavelengths. Sunlight offers all the photons of the rainbow, so a gas molecule can choose the photons that carry the exact amount of energy needed to shift the molecule to its next energy level. When this match is made, the photon disappers as the molecule gains its energy, and we get a small gap in our rainbow. If a photon carries too much or too little energy, the molecule has no choice but to let it fly past. This is why glass is transparent. The atoms in glass do not pair well with any of the energy levels in visible light, so the photons pass through. So, which photons does carbon dioxide prefer? Where is the black line in our rainbow that explains global warming? Well, it's not there. Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the Sun. It absorbs light from a totally different celestial body. One that doesn't appear to be emitting light at all: Earth. If you're wondering why our planet doesn't seem to be glowing, it's because the Earth doesn't emit visible light. It emits infared light. The light that our eyes can see, including all of the colors of the rainbow, is just a small part of the larger spectrum of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma rays. It may seem strange to think of these things as light, but there is no fundamental difference between visible light and other electromagnetic radiation. It's the same energy, but at a higher or lower level. In fact, it's a bit presumptuous to define the term visible light by our own limitations. After all, infrared light is visible to snakes, and ultraviolet light is visible to birds. If our eyes were adapted to see light of 1900 megahertz, then a mobile phone would be a flashlight, and a cell phone tower would look like a huge lantern. Earth emits infrared radiation because every object with a temperature above absolute zero will emit light. This is called thermal radiation. The hotter an object gets, the higher frequency the light it emits. When you heat a piece of iron, it will emit more and more frequencies of infrared light, and then, at a temperature of around 450 degrees Celsius, its light will reach the visible spectrum. At first, it will look red hot. And with even more heat, it will glow white with all of the frequencies of visible light. This is how traditional light bulbs were designed to work and why they're so wasteful. 95% of the light they emit is invisible to our eyes. It's wasted as heat. Earth's infrared radiation would escape to space if there weren't greenhouse gas molecules in our atmophere. Just as oxygen gas prefers the dark red photons, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases match with infrared photons. They provide the right amount of energy to shift the gas molecules into their higher energy level. Shortly after a carbon dioxide molecule absorbs an infrared photon, it will fall back to its previous energy level, and spit a photon back out in a random direction. Some of that energy then returns to Earth's surface, causing warming. The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the more likely that infrared photons will land back on Earth and change our climate."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Oxygen gas snatched up some of the ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dark red light"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Blue light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bright green light"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Indigo light"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Every atom and molecule has a set number of ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Duplicates in the known universe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Directional ways that it can move"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Energy levels for its electrons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Light consists of tiny particles called ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Protons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Photons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Motowns"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Flashers"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Carbon dioxide doesn't absorb light directly from the sun.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The earth emits ________ light.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Infrared"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Visible"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Heat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Green"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But what we often forget is that much of this art was not produced with a museum setting in mind. What happens to an artwork when it's taken out of its originally intended context? Take the example of Michelangelo's Statue of David, depicting the boy hero who slew the giant philistine, Goliath, armed with only his courage and his slingshot. When Michelangelo began carving a block of pure white marble to communicate this famous Biblical story, the city of Florence intended to place the finished product atop their grand cathedral. Not only would the 17 foot tall statue be easily visible at this height, but its placement alongside 11 other statues of Old Testament heroes towering over onlookers would have a powerful religious significance, forcing the viewer to stare in awe towards the heavens. But by the time Michelangelo had finished the work, in 1504, the plans for the other statues had fallen through, and the city realized that lifting such a large sculpture to the roof would be more difficult than they had thought. Furthermore, the statue was so detailed and lifelike, down to the bulging veins in David's arm and the determination on his face, that it seemed a shame to hide it so far from the viewer. A council of politicians and artists convened to decide on a new location for the statue. Ultimately voting to place it in front of the Palazzo della Signoria, the town hall and home of the new Republican government. This new location transformed the statue's meaning. The Medici family, who for generations had ruled the city through their control of banking, had recently been exiled, and Florence now saw itself as a free city, threatened on all sides by wealthy and powerful rivals. David, now the symbol of heroic resistance against overwhelming odds, was placed with his intense stare, now a look of stern warning, focused directly towards Rome, the home of Cardinal Giovanni de Medici. Though the statue itself had not been altered, its placement changed nearly every aspect of it from a religious to a political significance. Though a replica of David still appears at the Palazzo, the original statue was moved in 1873 to the Galleria dell'Accademia, where it remains today. In the orderly, quiet environment of the museum, alongside numerous half-finished Michelangelo sculptures, overt religious and political interpretations fall away, giving way to detached contemplation of Michelangelo's artistic and technical skill. But even here, the astute viewer may notice that David's head and hand appear disproportionately large, a reminder that they were made to be viewed from below. So, not only does context change the meaning and interpretation of an artwork throughout its history, sometimes it can make that history resurface in the most unexpected ways."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The story of David vs. Goliath is ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "From a Greek myth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A tale from the Roman Empire"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A biblical story"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The story of a Renaissance prince"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The intended original location for Michelangelo’s Statue of David was ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Cathedral"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Santa Croxe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Overlooking the city of Florence from the city walls"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Palazzo della Signoria"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "When was Michelangelo’s Statue of David debuted?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1620"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1504"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1492"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1453"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Towards which city does Michelangelo’s Statue of David face?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Venice"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Milan"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rome"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Paris"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Where is the original Statue right now?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Galleria dell’Accademia (a museum)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Uffizi Gallery (a museum)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Atop the Cathedral"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In front of the Palazzo della Signoria (political capital)"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

myself arrested in front of the White House protesting and what would you do if you knew what I know let's start with how I got to this point I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the State University and I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first US satellites Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus that there was intense microwave radiation did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere or was Venus extremely hot the right answer confirmed by the Soviet Vena spacecraft was that Venus was very hot 900° fah and it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid but while our instrument was being built I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing eventually I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important it changes will affect all Humanity the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century British physicist John Tindle in the 1850s made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation which is heat and he showed that Gases such as CO2 absorb heat thus acting like a blanket warming Earth's surface I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations in 1981 we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 de C in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2 that Earth would likely warm in the 1980s and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century we also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones creation of drought prone regions in North America and Asia erosion of ice sheets rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage all of these impacts have since either happened or are now well underway that paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to con in the 1980s testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth's water cycle heat waves and droughts on one hand directly from the warming but also because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy rainfall will become in more extreme events there will be stronger storms and greater flooding global warming hoop law became time consuming and distracted me from doing science partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony so I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others by 15 years later evidence of global warming was much stronger most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts I had the privilege to speak twice to the president's climate task force but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels by then we had two grandchildren Sophie and Connor I decided that I did not want them in the future to say oppa understood what was happening but he didn't make it clear so I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American geophysical Union this led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters after I informed the New York Times about these restrictions NASA was forced to end the censorship but there were consequences I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement to understand and protect the home planet to justify my talks soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted never to appear again over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies while still researching the physics of climate change let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics first from Earth's energy balance and second from Earth's climate history adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed it reduces Earth's heat radiation to space so there's a temporary energy imbalance more energy is coming in than going out until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun so the key quantity is Earth's energy imbalance is there more energy coming in than going out if so more warming is in the pipeline it will occur without adding any more greenhouse gases now finally we can measure Earth's energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth's heat reservoirs the biggest Reservoir the ocean was the least well measured until until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world's ocean these floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining Heat at a substantial rate the deep ocean is also gaining Heat at a smaller rate and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet and the land to depths of tens of meters is also warming the total energy imbalance now is about 6/10 of a watt per square meter that may not sound like much but when added up over the whole world it's enormous it's about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity it's equivalent to exploding 400,000 hirosima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year that's how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day this imbalance if we want to stabilize climate means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 PPM parts per million back to 350 PPM that is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming climate change deniers argue that the sun is the main cause of climate change but the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record when the sun's energy reaching Earth was least yet there was more energy coming in than going out this shows that the effect of the sun's variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gases mainly from burning fossil fuels now consider earth's climate history these curves for Global temperature atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from Ocean cores and Antarctic Ice cores from Ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a 2-mile thick ice sheet as you see there is a high correlation between temperature CO2 and sea level careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying look the temperature causes CO2 to change not vice versa but that leg is exactly what is expected small changes in Earth's orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on earth when there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer ice sheets melt shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer a warmer ocean releases CO2 just as a warm Coca-Cola does and more CO2 causes more warming so CO2 methane and ice sheets were feedbacks that Amplified Global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing the important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today the physics does not change as Earth warms now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere ice will melt and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost while we can't say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur it is certain they will occur unless we stop the warming there is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning prec precise measurements by Grace the gravity satellite reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass several hundred cubic kilometers per year and the rate has accelerated since the measurements began 9 years ago methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost what sea level rise can we look forward to the last time CO2 was 390 PP M today's value sea level was higher by at least 15 m 50 ft where you are sitting now would be underwater most estimates are that this Century we will get at least one meter I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels perhaps even 5 meters which is 18 ft this Century or shortly thereafter the important point is that we will have started a process that is out of Humanity's control ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries there would be no stable Shoreline The Economic Consequences are almost Unthinkable hundreds of New Orleans likee devastations around the world what may be more reprehensible if climate denial continues is extermination of species the monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50% of all species that the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business as usual fossil fuel use global warming is already affecting people the Texas Oklahoma Mexico Heatwave and drought last year Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 were all exceptional events more than three standard deviations outside the norm 50 years ago such anomalies covered only 2 to 3/10 of 1% of the land area in recent years because of global warming they Now cover about 10% and increase by a factor of 25 to 50 so we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heat waves were not natural they were caused by global warming an important impact if global warming continues will be on the Bread Basket of our nation and the world the Midwest in Great Plains which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts worse than the Dust Bowl within just a few decades if we let global warming continue how did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate giving talks in 10 countries getting arrested burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years more grandchildren helped me along Jake is a super positive enthusiastic boy here at Age 2 and A2 years he thinks he can protect his 2 and a half day old little sister it would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple honest approach of a gradually Rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100% electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they pay in increased prices this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and Innovations creating millions of jobs it is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future several top economists are co-authors on this proposition Jim dep peso a Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly transparent market-based does not enlarge government leaves energy decisions to individual choices sounds like a conservative climate plan but instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 4500 billion dollar per year worldwide thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel mountaintop removal long wall mining fracking tar Sands tar Shale deep ocean Arctic drilling this path if continued guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future Generations a large fraction of species will be committed to Extinction and increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact bread baskets of the world causing massive famin and economic decline imagine a giant asteroid on a direct Collision Course with earth that is the equivalent of what we face now yet we dither taking no action to divert the asteroid even though the longer we wait the more difficult and expensive it becomes if we had started in 2005 it would have required emission reductions of 3% per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabil ized climate this Century if we start next year it is 6% per year if we wait 10 years it is 15% per year extremely difficult and expensive perhaps impossible but we aren't even starting so now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm clearly I haven't got this message across the science is clear I need your help to communicate

But while tattoo styles come and go, and their meaning has differed\ngreatly across cultures, the practice is as old\nas civilization itself. Decorative skin markings have\nbeen discovered in human remains all over the world, with the oldest found on a Peruvian\nmummy dating back to 6,000 BCE. But have you ever wondered\nhow tattooing really works? You may know that we shed our skin, losing about 30-40,000\nskin cells per hour. That's about 1,000,000 per day. So, how come the tattoo doesn't\ngradually flake off along with them? The simple answer\nis that tattooing involves getting pigment deeper into the skin than the outermost layer that gets shed. Throughout history, different cultures have used various methods\nto accomplish this. But the first modern tattooing machine was modeled after Thomas Edison's\nengraving machine and ran on electricity. Tattooing machines used today insert tiny needles,\nloaded with dye, into the skin at a frequency of 50\nto 3,000 times per minute. The needles punch through the epidermis, allowing ink to seep deep into the dermis, which is composed of collagen fibers,\nnerves, glands, blood vessels and more. Every time a needle\npenetrates, it causes a wound that alerts the body to begin\nthe inflammatory process, calling immune system cells\nto the wound site to begin repairing the skin. And it is this very process\nthat makes tattoos permanent. First, specialized cells\ncalled macrophages eat the invading material in an attempt\nto clean up the inflammatory mess. As these cells travel\nthrough the lymphatic system, some of them are carried back with a belly\nfull of dye into the lymph nodes while others remain in the dermis. With no way to dispose of the pigment, the dyes inside them remain\nvisible through the skin. Some of the ink particles\nare also suspended in the gel-like matrix of the dermis, while others are engulfed\nby dermal cells called fibroblasts. Initially, ink is deposited\ninto the epidermis as well, but as the skin heals, the damaged\nepidermal cells are shed and replaced by new, dye-free cells with the topmost layer peeling\noff like a heeling sunburn. Blistering or crusting is not typically\nseen with professional tattoos and complete epidermal\nregeneration requires 2-4 weeks, during which excess\nsun exposure and swimming should be avoided to prevent fading. Dermal cells, however,\nremain in place until they die. When they do, they are taken up,\nink and all, by younger cells nearby, so the ink stays where it is. But with time, tattoos do fade naturally as the body reacts\nto the alien pigment particles, slowly breaking them down\nto be carried off by the immune system's macrophages. Ultraviolet radiation can also\ncontribute to this pigment breakdown, though it can be mitigated\nby the use of sunblock. But since the dermal cells\nare relatively stable, much of the ink will remain deep\nin the skin for a person's whole life. But if tattoos are embedded in your skin\nfor life, is there any way to erase them? Technically, yes. Today, a laser is used\nto penetrate the epidermis and blast apart underlying pigment\ncolors of various wavelengths, black being the easiest to target. The laser beam breaks the ink globules\ninto smaller particles that can then be cleared away\nby the macrophages. But some color inks are harder\nto remove than others, and there could be complications. For this reason, removing a tattoo\nis still more difficult than getting one, but not impossible. So a single tattoo may\nnot truly last forever, but tattoos have been around longer\nthan any existing culture. And their continuing popularity means\nthat the art of tattooing is here to stay."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the outermost skin layer called?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hypodermis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dermis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Connective Tissue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Epidermis"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Tattooing can be permanent if the ink particles get trapped in which layer?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hypodermis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dermis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stratum Corneum"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Epidermis"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What structures can you find in the dermis?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Blood vessels"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nerves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Glands"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Every time the needle penetrates the skin, it causes the wound to initiate which bodily process?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cognition"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Metabolism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inflammation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Respiration"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which type of cell is able to engulf, or ‘eat,’ invading bacteria and debris?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Macrophage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Keratinocyte"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cytokine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Melanocyte"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

"let me begin with four words that will provide the context for this week four words that will come to define this century here they are the earth is full full of us full of our stuff full of our waste full of our demands yes we are a brilliant and creative species but we've created a little too much stuff so much that our economy is now bigger than its host our planet this is not a philosophical statement this is just science both in physics chemistry and biology there are many science-based analyses of this but they all draw the same conclusion that we're living beyond our means the eminent scientists of the global footprint Network for example calculate that we need about 1.5 earth to sustain this economy in other words to keep operating at our current level we need for 2% more earth than we've got in financial terms this would be like always spending 50% more than you earn going further into debt every year but of course she can't borrow natural resources so we're burning through our capital or stealing from the future so when I say full I mean really full well past any margin for error well past any dispute about methodology what this means is our economy is unsustainable I'm not saying it's not nice or Pleasant or that are spared for polar bears or forests though it certainly is what I'm saying is our approach is simply unsustainable in other words thanks for those pesky laws of physics when things aren't sustainable they stop but that's not possible you might think we can't stop economic growth because that's what will stop economic growth it will stop because of the end of cheap resources it will stop because of the growing de and of us on on all the resources all the capacity all the systems of the earth which is now having economic damage when we think about economic growth stopping we go that's not possible because economic growth is so central to our society that it is really questioned although growth has certainly differed many benefits it is an idea so central that we tend not to understand the possibility but not being around even though it has delivered many benefits it is based on a crazy idea the crazy idea being that we can have infinite growth on a finite planet and I'm here to tell you the emperor has no clothes that the crazy idea is just that it is crazy and with the earth full it's game over come on you're thinking that's not possible technology is amazing people are in innovative there are so many ways we can improve the way we do things we can surely sort this out that's all true well it's mostly true we are certainly amazing and we regularly solve complex problems with amazing creativity so if our problem was to get the human economy down from 150 percent to a hundred percent of the Earth's capacity we could do that the problem is we're just warming up this growth engine we plan to take this highly stressed economy and make it twice as big and then make it four times as big not in some distant future but in less than 40 years in the lifetime of most of you china plans to be there in just 20 years the only problem with this plan is that it's not possible in response some people argue but we need growth we needed to solve poverty we needed to develop technology we needed to keep social stability I find this argument fascinating as though we can kind of bend the rules of physics to suit our needs it's like the earth doesn't care what we need mother Nature doesn't negotiate she just sets rules and describes consequences and these are not as a tarik limits this is about food and water soil and climate the basic practical and economic foundations of our lives so the idea that we can smoothly transition to a highly efficient solar powered knowledge-based economy transformed by science and technology so that nine billion people can live in 2015 a life of abundance and digital downloads is a delusion it's not that it's not possible to feed clothe and house us all and heavily live decent lives it certainly is but the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong and it's dangerously wrong because it means we're not getting ready for what's really going to happen see what happens when you operate a system passes limits and then keep on going at an ever-accelerating rate is that the system stops working and breaks down and that's what will happen to us many of you will be thinking but surely we can still stop this if it's that bad we'll react let's just think through that idea now we've had 50 years of warnings we've had science proving the urgency of change we've had Economic Analysis pointing out that not only can we afford it it's cheaper to act early and yet the reality is we've done pretty much nothing to change course we're not even slowing down last year on climate for example we had the highest global emissions ever the story on food on water on soil and climate is all much the same they don't say this in despair I've done my grieving about the loss I accept where we are it is sad but it is what it is but it is also time that we ended our denial and recognized that we're not acting we're not close to acting and we're not going to act until this crisis hits the economy and that's why the end of growth is the central issue and the event that we need to get ready for so when does this transition begin when does this breakdown begin in my view it is well underway I know most people don't see it that way we tend to look at the world not as the integrated system that it is but as a series of individual issues we see the Occupy protests we see spiraling debt crises we see growing inequality we see money's influence on politics we see resource constraint food and oil prices but we see mistakenly each of these issues as individual problems to be solved in fact it's a system in the painful process of breaking down our system of debt fueled economic growth of ineffective democracy either overloading planet Earth is eating itself alive I could give you countless studies and evidence to prove this but I won't because if you want to see it that evidence is all around you I want to talk to you about fear I want to do so because in my view the most important issue we face right is how we respond to this question the crisis is now inevitable the issue is how will we react of course we can't know what will happen the future is inherently uncertain but let's just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bursts when the financial markets recognize that they have any hope of preventing that climate spiraling out of control the oil and coal industries are finished imagine China India and Pakistan going to war as climate impacts generate conflict over food and water imagine the middle-east without oil income but with collapsing governments imagine our highly tuned just-in-time food industry and our highly stressed agricultural system failing and supermarket shelves empty imagine 30% unemployment in America as the global economy is gripped by fear and uncertainty now imagine what that means for you your family your friends your personal financial security imagine what it means for your personal security as a heavily armed civilian population gets angrier and angrier about why this was allowed to happen imagine what you'll tell your children when they ask you so in 2012 mom and dad what was it like when you'd had the hottest decade on record for the third decade in a row when every scientific body in the world was saying you've got a major problem when the oceans are acidifying when oil and food prices were spiking when they were rioting in the streets of London and Occupy Wall Street when the system was so clearly breaking down mum and dad what did you do what were you thinking so how do you feel when the lights go out on the global economy in your mind when your assumptions about the future fade away and something very different emerges just take a moment and take a breath and think what do you feel at this point perhaps denial perhaps anger maybe fear of course we can't know what's going to happen we have to live with uncertainty well when we think about the kind of possibilities I paint we should feel a bit of fear we are in danger all of us and we've evolved to respond to danger with fear to motivate a powerful response to help us bravely face a threat but this time is not a tiger at the cave mouth you can't see the danger at your door but if you look you can see it at the door of your civilization that's what we need to fill our response now while the lights are still on because if we wait until the crisis takes hold we may panic and hide if we feel it now and think it true we will realize we have nothing to fear but fear itself yes things will get ugly and it will happen soon certainly in our lifetime but we are more than capable of getting true everything that's coming you see those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem that technology is limitless the markets can be a force for good are in fact right the only thing they're missing is that it takes a good crisis to get us going when we feel fear and we fear loss we are capable of quite extraordinary things think about war after the bombing of Pearl Harbor it just took four days for the government to ban the production of civilian cars and to redirect the auto industry and from there to rationing of food and energy think about how a company responds to bankruptcy threats and how change that seemed impossible just gets done think about how an individual responds to a diagnosis of a life-threatening illness and how lifestyle changes that previously were just too difficult suddenly become relatively easy we are smart in fact we really are quite amazing but we do love a good crisis and the good news this one's a monster sure if we get it wrong we could face the end of this civilization but if we get it right it could be the beginning of civilization instead and how cool would it be to tell your grandchildren that you were part of that there's certainly no technical or economic barrier in the way scientists like James Hansen tell us we may need to eliminate net co2 emissions from the economy in just a few decades I wanted to know what that would take so I work with Professor Jurgen Randers from Norway to find the answer we developed a plane called the one degree ball plane so named because of the level of mobilization and focus required to my surprise eliminating net co2 emissions from the economy in just 20 years is actually pretty easy and pretty cheap not very cheap but certainly less than the cost of a collapsing civilization we didn't calculate that precisely but we understand it's very expensive you can read the details but in summary we can transform our economy we can do it with proven technology we can do it at an affordable cost we can do it with existing political structures the only thing we need to change is how we think and how we feel and this is where you come in when we think about the future I paint of course we should feel a bit of fear but fear can be paralyzing or motivating we need to accept the fear and then we need to act we need to act like the future depends on it we need to act like we only have one planet we can do this I know the free market fundamentalists will tell you that more growth more stuff and nine billion people going shopping is the best we can do they're wrong we can be more we can be much more we have achieved remarkable things since working out how to grow food some 10,000 years ago we've built a powerful foundation of science knowledge and technology more enough to build a society where nine billion people can lead decent meaningful and satisfying lives the US can support that if we choose the right path we can choose this moment of crisis to ask an answer the big questions of society's evolution like what do we want to be when we grow up when we move past this bumbling adolescence where we think there are no limits and suffer delusions of immortality well it's time to grow up to do wiser to become a to be more considered like generations before us we'll be growing up in war not a war between civilizations but a war for civilization for the extraordinary opportunity to build a society which is stronger and happier and plans on staying around into middle-age we can choose life over fear we can do what we need to do but it will take every entrepreneur every artist every scientist every communicator every mother every father every child every one of us this could be our finest hour thank you"}, "multiple-choice": []}

She knows that if she deposits the money for a year instead of buying the car today, she will earn interest. Then she'll be able to afford the car. Sheila knows that the value of her deposit one year from now will equal the money deposited today plus the interest earned. We call Sheila's money deposited today the present value of money. And the value of Sheila's deposit next year is the future value of money. What connects one to the other? The interest rate, also known as the time value of money. Now, with a little bit of rearranging, we can figure out the future value of Sheila's money with this equation. So in a year, the future value will be $11,000. Well, it's been a year! And there's Sheila, with enough money to buy the car. Sheila really understands the future value of money. Now, I just hope she understands the speed limit! Now, meet Timmy. He's also gotten his bonus. The money seems to be burning a hole in his pocket. Yes, Timmy, that's a nice car that will surely impress people. Oh! Looks like you're a little short. Maybe you can follow Sheila's example. You see, Timmy, just like Sheila, after the first year, you'll have $11,000. But Timmy, that is still not enough to buy that fancy car. Why don't you leave the money deposited for another year? Let's see how your deposit will be doing in two years. With a little bit of rearranging, it becomes the value of your money next year, times one plus the interest rate. We can then convert the future value one year from now to the present value times one plus the interest rate. We can even simplify this further by just squaring the value of one plus the interest rate. Sorry, Timmy, you'll have more money after two years, but you still can't afford the car! I don't know how many more years you'll have to wait, but I can tell you one way we can figure it out. Do you see that little number two in the equation? Any number that you put in there is the number of years that you are waiting, also known as the period. Sure, Timmy, we can see how much you'll have in five years. Let's connect future value and present value across five years. Let's watch the period increase from two to five. After 5 years, you'll have $16,105.10. Sorry, Timmy, you have to wait a little longer. 10 years? Yeah! Let's see if you'll be able to buy the car then. Not quite. Well, Timmy, it looks like you'll need 26 years to afford this car. You should ask Sheila for a ride to the beach. Maybe a bicycle will suit you better? I hear the bus is pretty cheap!"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The financial term for the time value of money is usually summarized as _____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Present value"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Future value"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Interest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cash"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If we know the value of an investment today, the investment period and the interest rate we can then calculate its ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Present value"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Future value"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Interest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cash"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The number of years of a particular investment is also known as ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Present value"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Future value"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Interest"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Investment period"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "If I invest $10,000 for two years, earning a 5% interest rate, the value of my investment at the end of the two years would be ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "$10,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "$15,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "$10,500"}, {"label": "D", "text": "$11,025"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

These words from the Declaration of Independence, and the facts behind them, are well known. In June of 1776, a little more than a year after the war against England began with the shots fired at Lexington and Concord, the Continental Congress was meeting in Philadelphia to discuss American independence. After long debates, a resolution of independence was approved on July 2, 1776. America was free! And men like John Adams thought we would celebrate that date forever. But it was two days later that the gentlemen in Congress voted to adopt the Declaration of Independence, largely written by Thomas Jefferson, offering all the reasons why the country should be free. More than 235 years later, we celebrate that day as America's birthday. But there are some pieces of the story you may not know. First of all, Thomas Jefferson gets the credit for writing the Declaration, but five men had been given the job to come up with a document explaining why America should be independent: Robert Livingston, Roger Sherman, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams were all named first. And it was Adams who suggested that the young, and little known, Thomas Jefferson join them because they needed a man from the influential Virginia Delegation, and Adams thought Jefferson was a much better writer than he was. Second, though Jefferson never used footnotes, or credited his sources, some of his memorable words and phrases were borrowed from other writers and slightly tweaked. Then, Franklin and Adams offered a few suggestions. But the most important change came after the Declaration was turned over to the full Congress. For two days, a very unhappy Thomas Jefferson sat and fumed while his words were picked over. In the end, the Congress made a few, minor word changes, and one big deletion. In the long list of charges that Jefferson made against the King of England, the author of the Declaration had included the idea that George the Third was responsible for the slave trade, and was preventing America from ending slavery. That was not only untrue, but Congress wanted no mention of slavery in the nation's founding document. The reference was cut out before the Declaration was approved and sent to the printer. But it leaves open the hard question: How could the men, who were about to sign a document, celebrating liberty and equality, accept a system in which some people owned others? It is a question that would eventually bring the nation to civil war and one we can still ask today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where and when was the Declaration of Independence adopted by the Continental Congress?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Philadelphia, July 1776"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Washington D.C., 1800"}, {"label": "C", "text": "New York, 1796"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Boston, 1776"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The man most responsible for writing the Declaration of Independence was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "John Adams"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Benjamin Franklin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Thomas Jefferson"}, {"label": "D", "text": "John Locke"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "According to the narrator, the assignment to write the Declaration was assigned to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Minutemen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Parliament"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Constitutional Convention"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A Committee of Five Men"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "According to the narrator, Congress eliminated from the Declaration a reference to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Taxes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Healthcare"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Slavery"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An American king"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "According to the lesson, John Adams thought Americans would celebrate its independence on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "June 11"}, {"label": "B", "text": "July 2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "July 4"}, {"label": "D", "text": "August 6"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Sneideman", "category": "Earth and Space Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/a-guide-to-the-energy-of-the-earth-joshua-m-sneideman", "transcript": {"en": "Energy is all around us, a physical quantity that follows\nprecise natural laws. Our universe has a finite amount of it; it's neither created nor destroyed but can take different forms, such as kinetic or potential energy, with different properties\nand formulas to remember. For instance, an LED desk lamp's 6 Watt bulb transfers 6 Joules\nof light energy per second. But let's jump back up into space to look at our planet,\nits systems, and their energy flow. Earth's physical systems include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. Energy moves in and out of these systems, and during any energy\ntransfer between them, some is lost to the surroundings, as heat, light, sound, vibration, or movement. Our planet's energy comes from\ninternal and external sources. Geothermal energy\nfrom radioactive isotopes and rotational energy\nfrom the spinning of the Earth are internal sources of energy, while the Sun\nis the major external source, driving certain systems,\nlike our weather and climate. Sunlight warms the surface and atmosphere\nin varying amounts, and this causes convection, producing winds\nand influencing ocean currents. Infrared radiation, radiating out\nfrom the warmed surface of the Earth, gets trapped by greenhouse gases\nand further affects the energy flow. The Sun is also the major source\nof energy for organisms. Plants, algae, and cyanobacteria use sunlight to produce organic matter from carbon dioxide and water, powering the biosphere's food chains. We release this food energy\nusing chemical reactions, like combustion and respiration. At each level in a food chain,\nsome energy is stored in newly made chemical structures, but most is lost to the surroundings, as heat, like your body heat, released by your digestion of food. Now, as plants are eaten\nby primary consumers, only about 10% of their total energy\nis passed on to the next level. Since energy can only flow\nin one direction in a food chain, from producers on to consumers\nand decomposers, an organism that eats lower\non the food chain, is more efficient than one higher up. So eating producers\nis the most efficient level at which an animal can get its energy, but without continual input of energy\nto those producers, mostly from sunlight, life on Earth as we know it\nwould cease to exist. We humans, of course, spend our energy\ndoing a lot of things besides eating. We travel, we build, we power\nall sorts of technology. To do all this, we use sources like fossil fuels: coal, oil, and natural gas, which contain energy that plants captured\nfrom sunlight long ago and stored in the form of carbon. When we burn fossil fuels in power plants, we release this stored energy to generate electricity. To generate electricity, heat from burning fossil fuels\nis used to power turbines that rotate magnets, which, in turn, create\nmagnetic field changes relative to a coil of wire, causing electrons to be\ninduced to flow in the wire. Modern civilization depends on our ability to keep powering that flow of electrons. Fortunately, we aren't limited\nto burning non-renewable fossil fuels to generate electricity. Electrons can also be induced to flow by direct interaction\nwith light particles, which is how a solar cell operates. Other renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, geothermal, and biofuels can also be used to generate electricity. Global demand for energy is increasing, but the planet\nhas limited energy resources to access through a complex\nenergy infrastructure. As populations rise, alongside rates of industrialization\nand development, our energy decisions grow\nmore and more important. Access to energy\nimpacts health, education, political power, and socioeconomic status. If we improve our energy efficiency, we can use our natural resources\nmore responsibly and improve quality of life for everyone."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Energy is a physical quantity that cannot be ______________or destroyed.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Transformed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Created"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lost"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Produced"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Changed"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Where does most of the US electricity come from (primary source)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Wind"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nuclear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Solar"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Coal"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Natural gas"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Energy choice impacts the quality of an individual and society by ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Impacting national security"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Impacting environmental quality"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Impacting economic systems"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Impacting natural resource production and consumption"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "What is a source of energy that is internal to the earth systems?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sun"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Moon"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tides"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Radioactive decay"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following provides the most energy for our ecosystem?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Moon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Sun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stars"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Oxygen"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Carbon dioxide"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

But what if the monster was not some giant rampaging beast, destroying a city, but just a tiny amount of seaweed with the potential to disrupt entire coastal ecosystems? This is the story of Caulerpa taxifolia, originally a naturally occurring seaweed native to tropical waters. In the 1980s, one strain was found to thrive in colder environments. This trait, combined with its beautiful, bright green color and ability to grow quickly without maintenance made it ideal for aquariums, which it helped keep clean by consuming nutrients and chemicals in the water. Further selective breeding made it even heartier, and soon it was used in aquariums around the world. But it was not long before a sample of this aquarium-developed super algae turned up in the Mediterranean Sea near the famed Oceanographic Museum of Monaco. The marine biologist who found it believed that the museum had accidentally realeased it into the ocean along with aquarium waters, while museum directors claimed it had be carried into the area by ocean currents. Regardless of how it ended up there, the non-native Caulerpa multiplied rapidly, having no natural predators due to releasing a toxin that keeps fish away. And like some mythical monster, even a tiny piece that broke off could grow into a whole new colony. Through water currents and contact with boat anchors and fishing lines, it fragmented and spread throughout Mediterranean coastal cities covering coral reefs. So what was the result of this invasion? Well, it depends on who you ask. Many scientists warned that the spread of Caulerpa reduces biodiversity by crowding out native species of seaweed that are eaten by fish, with the biologist who first discovered its presence dubbing it Killer Algae. Other studies instead claim that the algae actually had a beneficial effect by consuming chemical pollutants -- one reason the aquariums strain was developed. But the disruption of a natural ecosystem by an introduced foreign species can have unpredictable and uncontrollable effects that may not be immediately visible. So when Culerpa taxifolia was discovered at Carlsbad's Agua Hedionda Lagoon, near San Diego in the year 2000, having most likely come from the dumping of home aquarium water into a connecting storm drain, it was decided to stop it before it spread. Tarps were placed over the Culerpa colonies and chlorine injected inside. Although this method killed all other marine life trapped under the tarps, it did succeed in eradicating the algae and native eelgrass was able to emerge in its place. By responding quickly, authorities in California were able to prevent Culerpa from propagating. But another occurrence of the strain, in the coastal wetlands of southeast Australia, was left unchecked and allowed to spread. And unfortunately, a tarp cannot cover the Mediterranean Sea or the Australian coast. Invasive species are not a new problem, and can indeed occur naturally. But when such species are the results of human directed selective breeding or genetic modification and then released into the natural environment, their effect on ecosystems can be far more radical and irreversible. With the proliferation of new technologies and multiple threats to the environment, it is more important than ever for scientists to monitor and evaluate the risks and dangers, and for the rest of us to remember that what starts in our backyard can effect ecosystems half a world away."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The California coastal town that found Caulerpa in Agua Hedionda Lagoon and became the first place in the world to eradicate it is called:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cambria"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Carlsbad"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cayucos"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cardiff"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The native version of Caulerpa grows in tropical waters around the world, and fish eat it to keep environmental balance; the aquarium strain releases a toxin that keeps fish away.

It's cheaper in many cases, and definitely more sustainable than our dependance on traditional power plants that use resources like coal, which will eventually run out. So why don't we replace these traditional plants with solar energy? Because there's one factor that makes solar power very unpredictable: cloud cover. As the sun's rays move towards Earth, some get absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, some are reflected back into outer space, but the rest make it to the Earth's surface. The ones that aren't deviated are called direct irradiance. The ones that are deflected by clouds are called diffuse irradiance. And those rays that first get reflected by a surface, like a nearby building, before reaching the solar energy system are called reflected irradiance. But before we can examine how clouds affect the sun's rays and electricity production, let's see how these solar energy systems work. First up, we have solar towers. These are made up of a central tower surrounded by a huge field of mirrors that track the sun's path and focus only the direct rays onto a single point on the tower, kind of like an eager beachgoer. The heat generated by these rays is so immense that it can be used to boil water producing steam that drives a traditional turbine, which makes electricity. But when we say solar energy systems, we're usually talking about photovoltaics, or solar panels, which are the systems most commonly used to generate solar power. In solar panels, photons from the sun's rays hit the surface of a panel, and electrons are released to get an electric current going. Solar panels can use all types of irradiance, while solar towers can only use direct irradiance, and this is where clouds become important because depending on their type and location relative to the sun, they can either increase or decrease the amount of electricity produced. For instance, even a few cumulus clouds in front of the sun can reduce the electricity production in solar towers to almost zero because of this dependence on direct rays. In solar panels, those clouds would decrease energy output as well, though not as much because solar panels can use all types of irradiance. However, all this depends on the clouds exact positioning. Due to reflection, or a particular phenomeon called Mie scattering, the sun's rays can actually be focused forward by clouds to create a more than 50% increase in the solar irradiance reaching a solar panel. If this potential increase isn't accounted for, it could damage the solar panel. Why does this matter? Well, you wouldn't want this lesson to stop just because a cloud passed over the panel on your roof. In solar towers, huge tanks of molten salt or oil can be used to store any excess heat and use it when needed, so that's how they manage the problem of fluctuating solar irradiance to smooth out electricity production. But in the case of solar panels, there currently isn't any way to affordably store extra energy. That's where traditional power plants come in because to correct for any fluctuations in these solar powered plants, extra electricity from traditional sources always needs to be available. But then why aren't these tradtional power plants just used as a backup, instead of us humans depending on them as our main sources of energy? Because it's impossible for an employee at a coal fired or a nuclear plant to turn a knob to produce more or less electricity depending on how many clouds there are in the sky. The response time would simply be too slow. Instead, to accommodate these fluctuations, some extra electricity from traditional power plants is always being produced. On clear sky days, that extra electricity might be wasted, but when cloudy skies prevail, it's what fills the gap. This is what we currently depend on for a constant supply of energy. For this reason, a lot of researchers are interested in forcasting the motion and formation of clouds through satellite images or cameras that look up at the sky to maximize the energy from solar power plants and minimize energy waste. If we could accomplish that, you'd be able to enjoy this video powered solely by the sun's rays, no matter what the weather, although if the sun is shining, you may be tempted to venture outside to go and do a different kind of cloud gazing."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which one the countries below has the highest solar irradiance potential?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Germany"}, {"label": "B", "text": "UK"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cyprus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Austria"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Finland"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the three (or combination of) types of solar irradiance do photovoltaics use?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Direct"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Diffuse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reflected"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All three"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Direct and reflected"}, {"label": "F", "text": "Direct and diffuse"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Do solar towers that produce energy from the sun work at night?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "No"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yes"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many main types of clouds are there?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "5"}, {"label": "B", "text": "8"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "12"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Can clouds increase solar irradiance reaching a photovoltaic?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "No"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Yes"}], "correct_option": null}]}

Valdovinos", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-bees-help-plants-have-sex-fernanda-s-valdovinos", "transcript": {"en": "Bees are very busy little matchmakers. Wingmen in every sense of the word. You see, the bees' side of the whole \"birds and the bees\" business is to help plants find mates and reproduce. In their work as pollinators, honeybees are integral to the production of nearly 1/3 of the food that we eat. And these bees, dutifully helping lonely plants have sex, aren't alone. But rather are part of a very complex network of matchmaking creatures, critical for the pollination of natural ecosystems and crops. Plants in many natural ecosystems need help to have sex. Like many of us, they're too busy to find a relationship. They have too much photosynthesis to do, and they can't find the time to evolve feet and walk to a singles bar. Those places are called meat markets for a reason, because plants can't walk. So they need matchmaker pollinators to transport their pollen grains to flowers of the same plant species, and they pay these pollinators with food. Today, around 170,000 plant species receive pollination services from more than 200,000 pollinator species. Pollinators include many species of bees, butterflies, moths, flies, wasps, beetles, even birds and bats, who together help pollinate many species of trees, shrubs and other flowering plants. In return, flowering plants are an abundant and diverse food source for pollinators. For instance, fossil records suggest bees may have evolved from wasps that gave up hunting after they acquired a taste for nectar. Plant pollinator networks are everywhere. Ecologists record these networks in the field by observing which pollinators visit which plants, or by analyzing the identity of pollen loads on their bodies. Networks, registered in these ways, contain from 20 to 800 species. These networks show a repeated structure, or architecture. Pollinators interact with plants in a very heterogenous way. Most plants are specialists, they have only one or a few matchmakers. Meanwhile, only a few generalist plants hire a diverse team of matchmakers, getting visits from almost all the pollinators of the network. The same occurs with pollinators. Most are specialists that feed on only a few plant species, while a few pollinators, including the honeybee usually, are generalists, busily feeding from and matchmaking for almost all the plant species in that ecosystem. What's interesting is that specialists and generalists across both plants and pollinators, sort themselves out in a particular pattern. Most pollinator networks, for which we have data, are nested. In a nested network, specialists tend to interact more with generalists than with other specialists. This is because if you're a specialist plant, and your only matchmaker also specializes on you as its only food source, you're each more vulnerable to extinction. So, you're better off specializing on a generalist pollinator that has other sources of food to ensure its persistence in bad years. The same goes if you're a specialist pollinator. You're better off in the long run specializing on a generalist plant that gets pollinated by other species in times when you're not around to help. Finally, in addition to nestedness, the networks are usually modular. This means that the species in a network are compartmentalized into modules of plants and animals that interact more with each other than with species in other modules. Think of them like social cliques. A plant or pollinator dying off will effect the species in its module, but those effects will be less severe on the rest of the network. Why's all that important? Because plant pollinator network structure effects the stability of ecosystems. Heterogeneous distribution, nestedness and modularity enable networks to better prevent and respond to extinctions. That's critical because nature is never static. Some species may not show up every year. Plants flower at different times. Pollinators mature on varying schedules. Generalist pollinators have to adapt their preferences depending on who's flowering when. So from one flowering season to the next, the participants and patterns of matchmaking can drastically change. With all those variables, you can understand the importance of generalist pollinators, like bees, to the stability of not only a crop harvest, but the entire network of plants and pollinators we see in nature, and rely on for life.

Before this, for most, art served other purposes. What we call fine art today was, in fact, primarily how people experienced an aesthetic dimension of religion. Paintings, sculpture, textiles and illuminations were the media of their time, supplying vivid imagery to accompany the stories of the day. In this sense, Western art shared a utilitarian purpose with other cultures around the world, some of whose languages incidentally have no word for art. So how do we define what we call art? Generally speaking, what we're talking about here is work that visually communicates meaning beyond language, either through representation or the arrangement of visual elements in space. Evidence of this power of iconography, or ability of images to convey meaning, can be found in abundance if we look at art from the histories of our major world religions. Almost all have, at one time or another in their history, gone through some sort of aniconic phase. Aniconism prohibits any visual depiction of the divine. This is done in order to avoid idolatry, or confusion between the representation of divinity and divinity itself. Keeping it real, so to speak, in the relationship between the individual and the divine. However, this can be a challenge to maintain, given that the urge to visually represent and interpret the world around us is a compulsion difficult to suppress. For example, even today, where the depiction of Allah or the Prophet Muhammad is prohibited, an abstract celebration of the divine can still be found in arabesque patterns of Islamic textile design, with masterful flourishes of brushwork and Arabic calligraphy, where the words of the prophet assume a dual role as both literature and visual art. Likewise, in art from the early periods of Christianity and Buddhism, the divine presence of the Christ and the Buddha do not appear in human form but are represented by symbols. In each case, iconographic reference is employed as a form of reverence. Anthropomorphic representation, or depiction in human form, eventually became widespread in these religions only centuries later, under the influence of the cultural traditions surrounding them. Historically speaking, the public appreciation of visual art in terms other than traditional, religious or social function is a relatively new concept. Today, we fetishize the fetish, so to speak. We go to museums to see art from the ages, but our experience of it there is drastically removed from the context in which it was originally intended to be seen. It might be said that the modern viewer lacks the richness of engagement that she has with contemporary art, which has been created relevant to her time and speaks her cultural language. It might also be said that the history of what we call art is a conversation that continues on, as our contemporary present passes into what will be some future generation's classical past. It's a conversation that reflects the ideologies, mythologies, belief systems and taboos and so much more of the world in which it was made. But this is not to say that work from another age made to serve a particular function in that time is dead or has nothing to offer the modern viewer. Even though in a museum setting works of art from different places and times are presented alongside each other, isolated from their original settings, their juxtaposition has benefits. Exhibits are organized by curators, or people who've made a career out of their ability to recontextualize or remix cultural artifacts in a collective presentation. As viewers, we're then able to consider the art in terms of a common theme that might not be apparent in a particular work until you see it alongside another, and new meanings can be derived and reflected upon. If we're so inclined, we might even start to see every work of art as a complementary part of some undefined, unified whole of past human experience, a trail that leads right to our doorstep and continues on with us, open to anyone who wants to explore it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "\"What we call fine art today was, in fact, primarily how people experienced an aesthetic dimension of ________.\"", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Religion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Facebook"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Society"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Art"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In this lesson, how do we define art?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An artist's way of life"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Paint on canvas"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Work that visually communicates meaning beyond language"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Everything is art, and art is everywhere"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Aniconism prohibits any visual depiction of the ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Royal family"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Divine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Human face"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spirit world"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is a curator?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Somebody who creates original works of art for the benefit of the public, usually displayed in a collection or a group of work"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Somebody who studies art and tell you that you can't take pictures in the museum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People who have a made a career out of their ability to recontextualize or remix cultural artifacts in a collective presentation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above may be true, but the best answer is C"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Boring and monotonous, spending endless hours in the lab with no social interaction? Maybe for some but not Tycho Brahe. The 16th century scholar who accurately predicted planetary motion and cataloged hundreds of stars before the telescope had been invented also had a cosmic-sized personal life. Tycho Brahe was born in 1546 to Danish nobles, but at age two was kidnapped to be raised by his uncle instead. His parents didn't seem to mind. Tycho was supposed to have a career in law, but after witnessing a solar eclipse at thirteen, he began spending more time with mathematics and science professors, who taught him the art of celestial observation. By the time Tycho's uncle sent him off to Germany a few years later, he had lost interest in his law studies, instead reading astronomy books, improving his instruments, and taking careful notes of the night skies. It wasn't long before his own measurements were more accurate than those in his books. While in Germany, Tycho got into a bit of an argument with another student at a party over a mathematical formula, resulting in a sword duel and Tycho losing a good-sized chunk of his nose. After that, he was said to have worn a realistic prosthetic of gold and silver that he would glue onto his face. Fortunately, Tycho didn't need his nose to continue his astronomical work. He kept studying the night sky and creating all sorts of instruments, including a building-sized quadrant for measuring the angles of stars. After months of careful observation, Tycho discovered a new star in the constellation Cassiopeia. The publication of this discovery granted him rock star status and offers of scientific positions all over Europe. Wanting to keep him at home, the King of Denmark offered to give Tycho his own personal island with a state of the art observatory. Called Uraniborg and costing about 1% of Denmark's entire budget, this observatory was more of a castle, containing formal gardens, rooms for family, staff and visiting royalty, and an underground section just for all the giant instruments. Tycho also built a papermill and printing press for publishing his papers, and a lab for studying alchemy. And since no castle would be complete without entertainment, Tycho employed a clairvoyant dwarf named Jep as court jester. Tycho lived on his island, studying and partying for about 20 years. But after falling out with the new Danish King, he took up an invitation from the Holy Roman Emperor to become the official imperial astronomer in Prague. There, he met another famous astronomer Johannes Kepler, who became his assistant. While Kepler's work interested him, Tycho was protective of his data, and the two often got into heated arguments. In 1601, Tycho attended a formal banquet where he drank quite a lot but was too polite to leave the table to relieve himself, deciding to tough it out instead. This proved to be a bad idea, as he quickly developed a bladder infection and died a few days later. But over 400 years after his death, Tycho still had a few surprises up his sleeve. When his body was exhumed and studied in 2010, the legendary gold and silver nose was nowhere to be found, with chemical traces suggesting that he wore a more casual brass nose instead. Tycho's mustache hair was also found to contain unusually high levels of toxic mercury. Was it from a medicine used to treat his bladder infection? A residue from his alchemy experiments? Or did his quarrelsome coworker Johannes Kepler poison him to acquire his data? We may never know, but the next time you think scientists lead boring lives, dig a little deeper. A fascinating story may be just beyond the tip of your nose."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What event early in Brahe’s life sparked his interest in astronomy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Failing grades in school"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Witnessing a solar eclipse"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Viewing the moon with a telescope"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Meeting a famous astronomer"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the subject of the argument that eventually ended in a sword duel and the loss of part of Brahe’s nose?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "An unpaid loan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An attractive woman"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A mathematical formula"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A stolen scientific instrument"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Brahe collaborated and sometimes quarreled with this famous astronomer:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nicolaus Copernicus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Galileo Galilei"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Johannes Kepler"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Isaac Newton"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Besides astronomy, Brahe pursued what other science-related interest?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The generation of electricity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dentistry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Designing flying machines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Alchemy"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What highly toxic substance was found in Brahe’s body when he was exhumed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Mercury"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arsenic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cyanide"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Radium"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 97, "lesson": 24, "title": "How to choose your news - Damon Brown", "category": "Media and Journalism", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-to-choose-your-news-damon-brown", "transcript": {"en": "How do you know what's happening in your world? The amount of information just a click away may be limitless, but the time and energy we have to absorb and evaluate it is not. All the information in the world won't be very useful unless you know how to read the news. To your grandparents, parents, or even older siblings, this idea would have sounded strange. Only a few decades ago, news was broad-based. Your choices were limited to a couple of general interest magazines and newspaper of record, and three or four TV networks where trusted newscasters delivered the day's news at the same reliable time every evening. But the problems with this system soon became apparent as mass media spread. While it was known that authoritarian countries controlled and censored information, a series of scandals showed that democratic governments were also misleading the public, often with media cooperation. Revelations of covert wars, secret assassinations, and political corruption undermined public faith in official narratives presented by mainstream sources. This breakdown of trust in media gatekeepers lead to alternative newspapers, radio shows, and cable news competing with the major outlets and covering events from various perspectives. More recently, the Internet has multiplied the amount of information and viewpoints, with social media, blogs, and online video turning every citizen into a potential reporter. But if everyone is a reporter, nobody is, and different sources may disagree, not only opinions, but on the facts themselves. So how do you get the truth, or something close? One of the best ways is to get the original news unfiltered by middlemen. Instead of articles interpreting a scientific study or a politician's speech, you can often find the actual material and judge for yourself. For current events, follow reporters on social media. During major events, such as the Arab Spring or the Ukrainian protests, newscasters and bloggers have posted updates and recordings from the midst of the chaos. Though many of these later appear in articles or broadcasts, keep in mind that these polished versions often combine the voice of the person who was there with the input of editors who weren't. At the same time, the more chaotic the story, the less you should try to follow it in real time. In events like terrorist attacks and natural disasters, today's media attempts continuous coverage even when no reliable new information is available, sometimes leading to incorrect information or false accusations of innocent people. It's easy to be anxious in such events, but try checking for the latest information at several points in the day, rather than every few minutes, allowing time for complete details to emerge and false reports to be refuted. While good journalism aims for objectivity, media bias is often unavoidable. When you can't get the direct story, read coverage in multiple outlets which employ different reporters and interview different experts. Tuning in to various sources and noting the differences lets you put the pieces together for a more complete picture. It's also crucial to separate fact from opinion. Words like think, likely, or probably mean that the outlet is being careful or, worse, taking a guess. And watch out for reports that rely on anonymous sources. These could be people who have little connection to the story, or have an interest in influencing coverage, their anonymity making them unaccountable for the information they provide. Finally, and most importantly, try to verify news before spreading it. While social media has enabled the truth to reach us faster, it's also allowed rumors to spread before they can be verified and falsehoods to survive long after they've been refuted. So, before you share that unbelievable or outrageous news item, do a web search to find any additional information or context you might have missed and what others are saying about it. Today, we are more free than ever from the old media gatekeepers who used to control the flow of information. But with freedom comes responsibility: the responsibility to curate our own experience and ensure that this flow does not become a flood, leaving us less informed than before we took the plunge."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the name of the people who used to determine what news was fit to print or play?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Peacekeepers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Watchdogs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gatekeepers"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Producers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which isn’t a word that shows the outlet isn’t completely sure about a particular statement?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Likely"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Certainly"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Expected"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Possibly"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When are the best times to check in on ongoing breaking news?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Every five minutes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "As quickly as your browser can refresh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The first five minutes, then in wider gaps to allow more details to develop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Don’t check in at all"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How reliable are anonymous sources?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "You never know"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Very reliable"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Not reliable at all"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Depends on the story"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How can you verify a story before you share it on social media?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There’s no way to verify – just share the story anyway"}, {"label": "B", "text": "See how many times other people online have shared the story"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Check to see if your friends are saying the same thing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Do a search to see if multiple outlets you trust are also covering the same story"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
