French fries with ketchup are a little slice of heaven. The problem is it's basically impossible to pour the exactly right amount. We're so used to pouring ketchup that we don't realize how weird its behavior is. Imagine a ketchup bottle filled with a straight up solid like steel. No amount of shaking would ever get the steel out. Now imagine that same bottle full of a liquid like water. That would pour like a dream. Ketchup, though, can't seem to make up its mind. Is it is a solid? Or a liquid? The answer is, it depends. The world's most common fluids like water, oils and alcohols respond to force linearly. If you push on them twice as hard, they move twice as fast. Sir Isaac Newton, of apple fame, first proposed this relationship, and so those fluids are called Newtonian fluids. Ketchup, though, is part of a merry band of linear rule breakers called Non-Newtonian fluids. Mayonnaise, toothpaste, blood, paint, peanut butter and lots of other fluids respond to force non-linearly. That is, their apparent thickness changes depending on how hard you push, or how long, or how fast. And ketchup is actually Non-Newtonian in two different ways. Way number one: the harder you push, the thinner ketchup seems to get. Below a certain pushing force, ketchup basically behaves like a solid. But once you pass that breaking point, it switches gears and becomes a thousand times thinner than it was before. Sound familiar right? Way number two: if you push with a force below the threshold force eventually, the ketchup will start to flow. In this case, time, not force, is the key to releasing ketchup from its glassy prison. Alright, so, why does ketchup act all weird? Well, it's made from tomatoes, pulverized, smashed, thrashed, utterly destroyed tomatoes. See these tiny particles? This is what remains of tomatoes cells after they go through the ketchup treatment. And the liquid around those particles? That's mostly water and some vinegar, sugar, and spices. When ketchup is just sitting around, the tomato particles are evenly and randomly distributed. Now, let's say you apply a weak force very quickly. The particles bump into each other, but can't get out of each other's way, so the ketchup doesn't flow. Now, let's say you apply a strong force very quickly. That extra force is enough to squish the tomato particles, so maybe instead of little spheres, they get smushed into little ellipses, and boom! Now you have enough space for one group of particles to get passed others and the ketchup flows. Now let's say you apply a very weak force but for a very long time. Turns out, we're not exactly sure what happens in this scenario. One possibility is that the tomato particles near the walls of the container slowly get bumped towards the middle, leaving the soup they were dissolved in, which remember is basically water, near the edges. That water serves as a lubricant betwen the glass bottle and the center plug of ketchup, and so the ketchup flows. Another possibility is that the particles slowly rearrange themselves into lots of small groups, which then flow past each other. Scientists who study fluid flows are still actively researching how ketchup and its merry friends work. Ketchup basically gets thinner the harder you push, but other substances, like oobleck or some natural peanut butters, actually get thicker the harder you push. Others can climb up rotating rods, or continue to pour themselves out of a beeker, once you get them started. From a physics perspective, though, ketchup is one of the more complicated mixtures out there. And as if that weren't enough, the balance of ingredients and the presence of natural thickeners like xanthan gum, which is also found in many fruit drinks and milkshakes, can mean that two different ketchups can behave completely differently. But most will show two telltale properties: sudden thinning at a threshold force, and more gradual thinning after a small force is applied for a long time. And that means you could get ketchup out of the bottle in two ways: either give it a series of long, slow languid shakes making sure you don't ever stop applying force, or you could hit the bottle once very, very hard. What the real pros do is keep the lid on, give the bottle a few short, sharp shakes to wake up all those tomato particles, and then take the lid off and do a nice controlled pour onto their heavenly fries."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How does a Newtonian fluid respond to force?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Linearly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Quadratically"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Exponentially"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Logarithmically"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Is pure water Newtonian?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "No"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Scientists aren't sure yet"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What’s the difference between ketchup and oobleck?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ketchup gets thicker the harder you push it and oobleck gets thinner the harder you push it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ketchup gets thinner the harder you push it and oobleck gets thicker the harder you push it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ketchup gets thicker the longer you push it and oobleck gets thinner the longer you push it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "There is no difference… except in taste"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why does ketchup get thinner the longer you shake the bottle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The particles are squished by the strong force"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The particles rearrange themselves into groups"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The particles are bumped away from the bottle toward the center"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Scientists aren’t sure"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How much thinner does ketchup get if you apply a force greater than the threshold?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "About 10 times thinner"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About 100 times thinner"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About 1,000 times thinner"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About 10,000 times thinner"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-weird-wonderful-world-of-bioluminescence-edith-widder", "transcript": {"en": "so I want to take you on a trip to an alien world and it's not a trip that requires light-years of travel but it's to a place where it's defined by light so it's a little appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make life I've spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution but mostly I'm entranced by it since my first dive in a deep diving submersible when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays I've been a bioluminescence junky but I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words and they were totally inadequate to the task I needed some way to share the experience directly and the first time I figured out that way was in this little single person submersible called deep Rover this next video clip you're going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence and the first thing you're going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across in front of the Sun a mesh screen will come into contact with the soft bodied creatures of the deep sea with the subs light switched off it is possible to see their bioluminescence the light produced when they collide with the mesh this is the first time that has ever been recorded so I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible but just to try to prove that fact to you I brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration so if we get up the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it and you'll note there's no light coming from them right now either because they're dead or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to be able to see what bioluminescence really looks like Oh I spend most of my time working in the dark I'm used to that okay so that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate a single-celled alga so why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light well uses it to defend itself from its predators the flash is like a scream for help it's what's known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm and just like the alarm on your car or your house it's meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away it's a lot of animals that use this trick for example this black dragon fish it's got a light organ under its eye it's got a chin barbel it's got a lot of other light organs you can't see but you'll see them here in a minute so we'd have to chase this and the submersible for quite some time because the top speed of this fish is one not which was a top speed of the submersible but it was worth it because we caught in a symmetric capture device brought it up into the lab on the ship and then everything on this fish lights up it's unbelievable the light organs under the eyes are flashing that chin barbel is flashing it's got light organs on its belly that are flashing fin lights it's a scream for help it's meant to attract attention it's phenomenal and you normally don't get to see this because we've exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets there's other ways you can defend yourself with light for example this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud this blinds or distracts the predator this little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this now it may look like a tasty morsel or a pig's head with wings but if it's attacked it puts out a barrage of light in fact a barrage of photon torpedoes I just barely got the lights out in time for you be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transept screen and then just glowing it's phenomenal so there's a lot of animals in the open ocean most of them that make light and we have a pretty good idea for most of them why they use it for finding food for attracting mates for defending against predators but when you get down at the bottom of the ocean that's where things get really strange and some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in Avatar but you don't have to travel to pandora to see them there are things like this this is a golden coral a bush it grows very slowly in fact it's thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed the other reason is this amazing bush glows so if you brush up against it anyplace you brushed against it you get this twinkling Bluegreen light it's just breathtaking and you see things like this this looks like something out of a dr. Seuss book just all manner of creatures all over this thing and these are flight wrapping enemies now if you poke it it pulls in its tentacles but if you keep poking it it starts to produce light and it actually ends up looking like a galaxy it produces these strings of light presumably as some form of defense there are starfish that can make light and there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms this looks like a plant but it's actually an animal and it angers itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock so it can actually hold itself in very strong currents as you see here but if we collect it very gently and bring it up into the lab just squeeze it at the base of the stock it produces this light that propagates from the stem to the plume change in color as it goes from green to blue colorization and sound effects added for your viewing pleasure but we have no idea why it does that here's another one this is also a see pen it's got a brittle star hitching a ride it's a green saber of light and like the one you just saw it can produce these as bands of light so if I squeeze the bass the band's go from base to tip if I squeeze the tip they go from tip to base so what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle I'd be very interested in your theories about what that's about so there's a language of light in the deep ocean and we're just beginning to understand it and one way we're going about that is we're imitating a lot of these displays this is an optical lure that I've used we call it the electronic jellyfish it's just sixteen blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays and we view it with a camera system I developed called I in the sea that uses far red light that's invisible to most animals so it's unobtrusive so I just want to show you some of the responses that we've elicited from animals in the deep sea so the camera is black and white it's not high resolution and what you're seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of like the cockroaches of the ocean they're isopods all over it and right in the front is the electronic jellyfish and when it starts flashing it's just going to be one of the LEDs that's flashing very fast but as soon as it starts to flash and it's going to look big because it blooms on the camera I want you to look right here and it's something small there that responds we're talking to something it looks like a little string of pearls basically in fact three strings of pearls this was very consistent this is in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet we basically have a chat room going on here because once it gets started everybody's talking and I think this is actually a shrimp that's releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water but the cool thing is we're talking to it we don't know what we're saying personally I think it's something sexy and then finally I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world's first deep-sea webcam which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year we've only just begun to analyze all of this data this is going to be a glowing source first which is like bioluminescent bacteria and it is an optical cue that there's carrion on the bottom of the ocean so this scavenger comes in which is a giant sixgill shark and I can't claim for sure that the optical source brought it in because there's bait right there but if it had been following the odor plume it would have come in from the other direction and it does actually try to seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish that's a 12-foot long giant sixgill shark okay so this next one is from the webcam and it's going to be this pinwheel display and this is a burglar alarm and that was a Humboldt squid a juvenile Humboldt squid about three feet long this is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon but if it's a burglar alarm you wouldn't expect it to attack the jellyfish directly it's supposed to be attacking what's attacking the jellyfish but we did see a bunch of responses like this this guy's a little more contemplative hey wait a minute there's supposed to be something else there he's thinking about it but he's persistent he keeps coming back and then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more and thinks maybe if I come in from a different angle nope so we are starting to get a handle on this but only just the beginnings we need more eyes on the process so if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible by all means climb in and take the plunge this is something that should be on everybody's bucket list because we live on an ocean planet more than 90% 99% of the living space on our planet is ocean it's a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures alien life-forms that you don't have to travel to another planet to see but if you do take the plunge please remember to turn out the lights but I warn you it's addictive thank you"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "It's a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our oceans ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Breathe oxygen"},

{"page": 53, "lesson": 3, "title": "Carbon - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/7ovw67KW", "transcript": {"en": "Carbon is a fantastically important element. There are probably, far more molecules that contain carbon, than any other element. The reason why you can get so many carbon compounds, is that carbon atoms, form chains very, very easily. Sometimes\nmillions of atoms long. If you just have atoms that will form one or two bonds\nthen you can't build up huge numbers of molecules. If there's no limit to the number of\nbonds you can make, You can make things that are really long. It's like the difference between a\nlorry; a truck which can pull if you're lucky, one trailer or perhaps two and a\ntrain where you can put as many wagons or carriages as you want. So you can get\nreally long train, so it's just the same with carbon. So carbon it's around us everywhere.\nWe're all carbon,  there are lots of carbon in us, in all the hydrocarbons within\nour body. Lots of that structures\ninside us and many many of the materials that we use every day. In fact the majority of us use carbon in\nthe form of fuels every day to get to work or to go home. Without carbon we\ncouldn't exist. You're carbon, I'm carbon, We have bones\nmade that of calcium. But the important parts of our brains contain largely\ncarbon. They contain nitrogen and oxygen and hydrogen as well, but carbon is the key. Carbon is one of the very few elements;\nthat has given rise to a whole area of chemistry. Organic chemistry; the\nchemistry of carbon compounds, is almost a separate discipline from some of the\nareas of chemistry and most of the molecules that we use for plastics, for\npharmaceutical products, for our food are all carbon compounds. Carbon is an\nextremely common element but it comes in a number of different allotropes, so\ndifferent forms and this one here; this is actually some charcoal, which is just\nsimple carbon. It's very, very similar and very very in fresh into it to graphite.\nYou can find lumps of carbon lying around. This is a piece here, that I found on a\nbeach, on the northeast of England; it's a piece of coal. Its not absolutely\npure carbon, but it has a very high proportion of carbon and compared to\nother stones, of this sort of size, it's really quite light more recently\npeople have discovered diamonds, and of course graphite which is the black\nmaterial that you get in pencils. People call them lead pencils but they actually\ncontain the form of carbon called graphite so carbon comes graphite, as diamond, and also as as buckyballs or fullerenes so the carbon here which is a bit like the\ngraphite; it is very amorphous and it's very very free-flowing so I'm going\nto pour a little bit of carbon out onto the paper so you can see\nso you can see its a very light powder and you can see that it's a very very\nnice, easily maneuverable and a really easy workable material. The thing that's really exciting is that\nin the last 20 years people have discovered new forms of carbon; now this is extraordinary! People have\nknown of carbon for thousands of years, even longer,  and suddenly in the last 20\nyears the number of different types of carbon has grown enormously. I have a colleague who is a specialist\nin these new forms of carbon and I went and asked him for a model and he gave me\na whole suitcase of models. Let me show you. ... So, what did we get? First of all, this is a model of graphite. The materials in the middle of pencils and it consists of layers of rings, hexagonal rings of carbon atoms. That six carbon atoms; and they're joined\ntogether in layers. Can you see here? There are purple bonds in\nbetween them. You can see they're not very strong; one is\neven broken here. Very recently in the last 10 years its been discovered that\nusing a piece of sellotape, you can pull off these layers; and make single sheets\nof these carbon atoms. It's called graphene. The 2-2010\nNobel Prize for physics, was given to two scientists for discovering graphene,\nThere's this structure here; where each carbon atom is joined to 4 others, in this\nsort of tetrahedral pattern. Tetrahedron is this group one in the\nmiddle with four rounded, and this–is diamond; it's really very strong. Whichever way you squash it, it's strong. You can't peel off layers of diamond with a piece of sellotape. Diamonds are colorless; and to understand why, you have to understand; what gives rise to\ncolor, and the color of anything my tie, anything are caused by electrons\nin the molecules or material and they absorb energy and go from one level to\nanother. In diamond, there are bonds between all the carbon\natoms that use all the electrons. The electrons are very tightly bound and\nnone of them can change their energy state, so you get no absorption. At least in the\nvisible region of the spectrum. On the other hand with graphite, the\nelectrons are less strongly bound. In fact it conducts electricity and it's\nblack because the electrons will absorb all wavelengths of visible light right\nfrom the blue to the red so that it looks black because none of the light is\nreflected from it. Inside here we have the famous molecule, C60 like a football (soccer ball US)\n60 carbon atoms and Ray has put a little one inside here but forget that for a\nmoment. So you can have this molecule C60 first\ndiscovered in the late 1980's. and only isolated in the early 1990's and there is a very similar molecule which looks a bit more squashed\nwhich is C70. Now these are also colored, but their color is rather different. Have\na look here. I've got two samples one of C60 and one\nof C70 both of them dissolved up in the solvent toluene. So if you look here C70 is a sort of\nreddish brown color and C60 in the solvent has a beautiful color. I call it purple, other people call it\nmagenta. Back to the box (suitcase) ... and in here, we have the final form of\ncarbon which are called nanotubes these are whole tubes; made up of\nhexagons. You have two sorts one which is closed at the end and this one here\nwhich is open rather like a basket. you can put things inside it the final\nmodel is graphene this material that you can peel off graphite with a seller tape\nsticky tape and the reason that people get so excited is first of all this is a\nvery thin material it's only one atom thick and you can\nreact the carbon atoms on here with all sorts\nof different molecules you can make very strong materials you\ncan start making electronics carbon computers things like that many people believe that graphene is one\nof the materials of the future this is one of and raised exhibits he uses it in exhibitions to measure\nelectrical conductivity to see if you take a piece of metal like this coin and\nyou put the two electrodes on there you can see it conducts electricity all the\nlights light up and the needle goes across so he's got different samples this one here is coal and this is graphite so there's a track of this is a photo\nand this is a track of coal between two metal electrodes and you can see if we\nput the electrodes on here the coal doesn't conduct electricity at all however if we take the graphite and do\nthe same it conducts electricity not very well\nbut you can see you do get some electricity going through on this other\nsheet he's got a sample of C60 and here of\nthe carbon nanotubes and you can see the C60 doesn't conduct electricity either\nthe electrons can't jump between one molecule and the other but when you come\nto the carbon nanotubes which are long molecules they conduct electricity\nreally well not quite as well as a metal but pretty close"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In pharmaceutical products, plastics and proteins in our bodies, carbon atoms form bonds to other atoms via:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Covalent bonds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ionic bonds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Metallic bonds"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The electrical conductivity of carbon materials increases according to which order?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Graphite < Nanotube < C60"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nanotube < Graphite < C60"}, {"label": "C", "text": "C60 < Graphite < Nanotube"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the name of the discipline of chemistry that focuses on carbon compounds?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Inorganic Chemistry"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Organic Chemistry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Analytical Chemistry"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

So this is a sample of my favourite element,\nthis is phosphorus. Phosphorus is a very, very reactive element, especially this type\nof phosphorus which is white phosphorus. Phosphorus itself, elemental phosphorus, exists as a\nnumber of different allotropes, so a bit like carbon with diamond and graphite, and here\nwe have one of these allotropes; it’s white phosphorus. It exists as discrete molecules\nof four phosphorus atoms connected like a pyramid, and those four phosphorus atoms are\nreally strained, really reactive and they want to really react with oxygen as quick\nas they can. This is the sort that is used in phosphorus\nbombs. It burns very easily and gives a very intense white light out of it. So instantaneously you can see that fantastic\noxidation reaction as the phosphorus reacts with the molecular oxygen in the gas inside\nthe flask. You can put it out quite easily by putting\nwater on it, provided that it hasn’t got too hot and the water will just evaporate. Very reactive form the other allotropes, black\nand red phosphorus, are not as reactive and are much, much easier for us to handle. Then there’s red phosphorus which is very\nmuch less reactive which is what is used in matches. It is used to make the heads of so-called\n‘non-safety’ matches, which are the ones you can strike on any sort of material, on\nbricks and so on, and they tend to be this rather red colour here. So the phosphorus, you’ll notice, that it’s\nstored under water, and it’s stored under water to keep the oxygen and the atmosphere\naway because it reacts very vigorously and can burn, hence the signs, it’s very, very\nflammable. It’s so flammable in fact that it burns just with the heat of the skin. So\nyou can see a number of scars across my hands, these are all from playing with phosphorus\nand doing reactions and experiments with phosphorus. Phosphorus is a very important point inside\nyour body. Some of you may have read Aldous Huxley’s book called ‘Brave New World’,\nwhich when people died they were sent to the phosphorus reclamation plant. And each average\nsize person contains somewhat over a pound of phosphorus inside their bodies, and nowadays\npeople can use magnetic resonance imaging to look and see how the phosphorus is used\ninside the body. So I’ve taken a small sample of my white\nphosphorus and I’ve dissolved it in an organic solvent which is carbon disulphide, because\nthe P4 is molecular and it dissolves really quite nicely in this molecular solvent. So\nnow what we are going to do is we’re going to go outside and we’re going to put this\non a piece of filter paper and then let the carbon disulphide evaporate so we can see\nthe reaction of the phosphorus with the oxygen and the paper. And the average person produces inside their\nbody about 70 kilos a day of a molecule called ATP, adenosine triphosphate, which is the\nenergy producing molecule inside the body. Now you don’t keep 70 kilos inside you,\nor you would explode, but you’re using it up all the time but in the course of the day\nyou synthesise nearly 70 kilos of this molecule. So as the carbon disulphide evaporates from\nthe paper, well there’s a couple of drips. And you can see that the phosphorus has oxidized\nin the air and it’s taken some of the paper with it to generate a nice ‘P’ for phosphorus."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the correct order of increasing reactivity and toxicity of the three allotropes of phosphorus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "White < red < black"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Black < red < white"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Red < white < black"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the molecular formula of the reactive allotrope white phosphorus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "P\n2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "P\n3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "P\n4"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Ok. I’m going to take it out of the bottle…\nof the… I’m going to have to wash my hands after this. So silicon is a very common element, it’s\nparticularly found in sand which is the oxide of silica; that’s\nthe compound of oxygen and silicon. It is also found in a variety of minerals\nwhich contain silicon, oxygen and another metal which are known as\nsilicates. And silicates occur in an enormous number of different\nminerals. It’s sort of the part of science that unless\nyou are a specialist you find quite boring but if you really go\ninto it like everything else it becomes really quite interesting. So this is a piece of polycrystalline silicon.\nIt’s a really quite fantastic element and it’s very often used,\nor in fact it’s used very regularly to make electronic components.\nAll of the computers that we use and actually the camera\nthat you are recording me on now are based upon silicon\ntechnology. Silicon is also extremely important and the\nbasis of most of the electronic devices we use: my watch, your\nvideo camera, and also in computers. And if we look over\nhere, I have got here this is an example of a silicon wafer;\nyou can see at the back this is silicon. So the silicon is grown as a single crystal\nfrom which we can make very highly-refined architectures on\nsilicon chips, but you see here we have a polycrystalline sample\nso it is very pretty the way that it interacts with the\nlight and you can see the different grain sizes. So let me take it out. Did Martyn show you the single crystal, the\nwafer? Yeah, he’s got a single chip, yeah, yeah. Cause if you can get the light coming off\nit, you can get all sorts of different coloured affects. Here you can see, this is pure silicon on\nthe back and on the front, people have grown chips these are the\nPentium 4 chips for the computer, I think, I am not absolutely\nsure but I think these are the chips and these are the connectors\non either side. So there are a whole lot of these chips\nand they grow a large number of them at once. These are chopped\nup and tested and the ones that worked are put into\ncomputers and the ones that are no good are just chucked\nand so this is a fantastically delicate piece of engineering\nmaking these. This is so-called 20cm wafer. They now make silicon\nchips on a 30cm wafer which is about this size and you\ncan get a large number more on them. If you get a single crystal of this silicon\nstructure, it can diffract the light and change the light so\nthat it diffracts and bends off at different angles so that you\nget like a rainbow effect off it. It’s really quite beautiful. A compound of silicon, silicon nitride is\nextremely tough and very light so it’s very difficult to break\nand silicon nitride for example is used in the impellers in turbo\nchargers in cars. So when you put your foot down on the accelerator\nit will spin up very fast because it is very light but\nit is very strong so it won’t very suddenly fall to bits as it is\nrevving up inside your engine. Right I must put that there because I want\nto put that back in a bag."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of these daily objects contains silicon atoms?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Glass vase"}, {"label": "B", "text": "PET plastic cup"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Paper table napkin"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the name of inert silicon polymers that can be found in implants?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Polystyrene"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Silanes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Silicones"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 53, "lesson": 6, "title": "Nitrogen - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/6Rtol3fK", "transcript": {"en": "So we're gonna go find some liquid Nitrogen. We keep it in a really large dewar tank at the back of the shop, so we're gonna go find that now.  So this is a dewar that we used to keep the liquid Nitrogen in within the building so it's much more convenient for us and our students to get it. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna fill up our small dewar to carry the Nitrogen back to the lab. So you can probably hear it hissing and fizzing going into the bottle, and you can see all the Nitrogen evaporating off. Nitrogen exists as a gas. Molecules of N2. And it is interesting, because the bond between the two Nitrogen atoms is the strongest bond that you can get between any two atoms in the Periodic Table. Any two atoms that are the same. Sometimes, if you have two atoms that are different, the bond can be slightly stronger, but the NN triple bond is one of the strongest that you can have. So what we're doing is we're filling up the dewar with liquid Nitrogen so that we can take that back to our lab to do our next experiment. So many explosive compounds, things that you've heard of, like TNT and other explosives, all contain Nitrogen, which are isolated atoms, and when the explosion goes off the atoms come together and release energy. Nitrogen is used widely in laboratories, partly because it's not as reactive as Oxygen, so if you do an experiment in an atmosphere of Nitrogen you can avoid reactions that might occur with air. You can also use Nitrogen when it's liquified as a coolant. Liquid Nitrogen boils at -196 degrees Centigrade, 77 degrees absolute, and you can just hold it in a normal thermous flask. So this is a dewar of liquid Nitrogen, and you can see that the Nitrogen is evaporating from the top, coming out and frosting, coming down over the sides because it's a little bit more dense than the air. You can see it's heavily laden with ice, and you can see that the ice crystals are starting to grow on the top of the dewar here. It's very cold though, so we mustn't touch it for too long. So if we just tip some out on the floor, we can see that the Nitrogen itself will come out like a liquid, like pouring water,  but the interesting thing is, water, when I pour it on the floor it forms a puddle. It does nothing useful. In fact, it sort of gets in the way. But liquid Nitrogen, when I pour it on the floor, it forms these really quite nice bubbles, and they fly across  to the side of the room and take all the dust with them. Pretty cool. But if you put materials like rubber or flowers into liquid Nitrogen, instead of being soft and bendy they become really rigid, and you can smash them with a hammer. So you can see all of the bubbles forming on this steel tray now, and they're sweeping away all the dust quite nicely as they evaporate and move further afield. So Neil's got a piece of tubing, and it's really quite flexible tubing, you can see it's really floppy, and now he's gonna put it into the cryogenic liquid Nitrogen and freeze it, and see what happens to the rubber. But you see another interesting thing there is that the liquid Nitrogen is siphoning out through the tube, and that's a really good joke, because you can direct that siphon at someones trousers and freeze their legs. So I think that's enough, Neil, let's see if it's a bit harder. Wow, that shattered.  And there's quite a nice little operation that I've heard about, in which you can take the lens out of somebody's eye when they're suitably anaesthetized, and this lens can be frozen and then put on the lathe and you can change its shape so you get the right shape, and then you let it unfreeze, it goes soft again, and you pop it back into their eye. . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCaptions by www.SubPLY.com"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "On a packet of crisps (chips in the USA), you will often see something similar to “atmosphere of nitrogen” written on the packet.

{"page": 53, "lesson": 8, "title": "Potassium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/39XwKjSz", "transcript": {"en": "So Potassium metal is very reactive.  One of my colleagues who used to work with it, described it as evil.  So we've come out behind the chemistry department. In the open air. To try and do  a re-take of the Potassium video.  The last sample of Potassium was very very small, maybe 500mg.  It will react, it is so reactive that if you have it  in a box with Argon, so that it can't get Oxygen from anywhere, it will take the Oxygen out of paper. Which is, paper is a compound of Carbon, Hydrogen and Oxygen. And it can extract this.  It's a reactive element. It's used in our body all the time. We have like, lots of Potassium floating around. And we've got some samples here, about a gram, maybe a gram and a half of each. It's a pretty big chunk of Potassium this.  Ready? Yeah. Very satisfying reaction.  After completing the 100 meters dash... Like Sodium it'ss quite a low melting point metal. And if you mix Sodium and Potassium together, to make so called Sodium Potassium amalgam, it's called NaK, by those who work in the trade, Na for Sodium, K for Potassium. NaK is a liquid at room temperature. It looks a bit like Mercury. A silver liquid. It's very light. And I never played with it, but people say that if you try and drop it on the floor, it will burst into flames before it hits the floor, because it reacts with the water in the air. Today I'm going to show you how to make a Potassium mirror. We will just fish out a nice little bit of Potassium. It's stored under mineral oil, because it reacts with water over time.  So it's quite malleable stuff. It's a little bit like if you imagine cutting Blu Tac. It's quite soft.  And it starts you see, it's starting to go a little bit already. Tarnishing a wee bit. So we can just manipulate it like that, and we are gonna pop it into our ampule, and we are gonna evacuate it now. I'm gonna remove all  of the atmosphere, from this ampule.  OK, we've done that because the, the boiling point of Potassium under one atmosphere is over 700 degrees C. Which is pretty high. It's too high for the glass to tolerate. If I heated it up to that temperature the glass would start to soften, melt. So by evacuating it, we remove all of the atmosphere which is keeping the boiling point as high as it is. So it lowers the boiling point  much lower. So it starts to drop into the range of water.   OK so we are just going to the blue flame, which is the nice hot flame.  And we just keep on gently warming it. And at some point, it will melt. Just enough that you will start to see bubbles  of Potassium just jumping out of this thin oxide layer, which is coating it at the minute. Now it's starting to form. So the reason we do it like this is that we end up with a  large surface of Potassium, so it's excellent for  keeping our solvents dry.  So what we've got now, is we've got the ampule, and all the way up here, this is literally a mirror of very thin Potassium.  Potassium is very important. Our bodies contain quite  a lot of Potassium. And it's in all sorts of biological material. If you burn  garden rubbish, in the ash that you get in the end is Potassium, which is presumably why it's called Potash.

{"page": 53, "lesson": 9, "title": "Sulfur - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/04CRDl3X", "transcript": {"en": "Ok, so we take the top off. We add a match. The Barking Dog experiment was one of the\nmost famous experiments and favourite experiments that was done by\nmy former colleague, Colonel B.D. Shaw. So Neil and I are preparing for one of my\nfavourite reactions. Itís called the Barking Dog reaction. This is a reaction\nwhich actually makes an element and weíre going to make some sulphur\ntoday. So the reactionís quite cool. In the Barking Dog experiment you have a mixture\nof the molecule carbon disulphide, CS2. Itís just like carbon\ndioxide butÖwait a minute IímÖ So this is a test tube, a rather large test\ntube, of laughing gas, N2O, and weíre going to use this to make some sulphur. So I have a model here. So itís CS2 which\nhas a carbon in the middle and sulphurs at either end. So it looks just like,\nin a model, as a molecule of CO2, but it has sulphur there and there. And\nthis molecule, CS2, will react with laughing gas, N2O. So where are we going to do this now? In the dark somewhere. So essentially you are just using the laughing\ngas as a sort of oxygen to burn this molecule. What we are actually going to do is generate\na lot of light. It used to be used as a flash, for cameras and for photography. What happens is you get a very bright emission\nof a sort of bluish purple light, which in the old days was used for\ntaking photographs before people had flash-lamps on their cameras. They\nwould set this off and it would give a great flash of light which could\nbe used to take photographs. But because itís much slower\nthan a flash it makes people really have quite a surprised look and this\nmay well be why, in old photographs, people look so surprised because\n\"My god, this thing has gone off, Whoosh!\" So weíre on the hunt for a very dark place. In the tube, as the reaction takes place it\ngenerates heat. Ok, so into the small lecture theatre which\nis vacant now. Itís quite nice because we can turn all the lights off and\nmake it a bit darker and see this reaction in its, sort of, best. So weíve managed to create a darker environment\nso we can really see the benefits from this chemistry, and Neilís\nput some water in the bottom of the tube. And weíre going to put about\n6-8 millilitres of carbon disulphide into this tube, and a good mix\nso you can be sure that we get all of that carbon disulphide going into the\nlater phase so that itíll react really quite quickly with all of that oxygen,\nthe N2O. As the flame goes down the tube it accelerates\nbecause the reactionís going faster and faster so it gives this great\nsort of ëwhoopí noise. Now then, that was a really, really energetic\nreaction because the organic and the oxygen were all in the same\nphase and the reaction got a lot faster. The noise it made got a lot\nlouder as it went down because of pressure. So what you can see in the tube\nhere is actually the result or the aim of our chemical reaction today\nbecause we wanted to make some sulphur. So what weíve got here, coated\non the inside of this tube, is a thin layer of polymeric sulphur. So you\ncan see all this really quite nice sulphur coating the inside of the glass\nflask itself. Now Iím really fortunate because Iím just going to go back\nto my office and prepare a lecture and leave Neil to clean this. Thanks. What are you doing mate? Well Iíve just filled up my vessel with some\noxygen. So this is liquid oxygen which we made for an earlier demonstration,\nand weíve just used it to drive off all of the non-combustible\nnitrogen form inside this glass vessel. Well look at all that oxygen\nfloating around inside the bottom of that flask, thatís really cool.\nAll oscillating - a really nice experiment. Yeah this is a really quite crazy jar. Itís\na small amount of sulphur, or ësuphurí, that weíve decanted out and unfortunately\nwhen we decanted it out we spelt the name wrong soÖ Whoís responsible for that? Err, itís aÖvery old friend of mine and\nI couldnít possiblyÖgive you his identity as he would be really, really angry.\nWouldnít he, Neil? Yeah Iím saying nothing. And it wasnít Neil. It wasnít me. So here weíve got a small amount of sulphur\nthat we are going to put on the tip of this spoon. So you can see itís\nstarting to melt. Now with the top, so itís on fire and then weíll just\ndrop it into the flask. And you can see that that sulphurís burning really intensely\nnow, with a really quite beautiful flame. Itís generating a lot of\nSO2, really smelly, which is why we are doing it inside this fume cupboard\nand you can see this really rich intense blue flame as that sulphur is burning\nin that excess oxygen in that atmosphere. Ok so this is actually a sort of geological\nsample of sulphur. So you can see itís actually on the bottom, weíve actually\ngot a rock and the sulphur crystals have actually formed on top of it.\nSo actually, sulphur does occur naturally. I think itís been known\nsince ancient times so, you know, when sermons are being delivered, fire\nand brimstone, was because hell is supposed to smell like sulphur,\nwhich is brimstone. But actually sulphur itself doesnít actually\nsmell, but what you are smelling, the ësulphuryí smell, is actually oxidised\nmaterial and hydrogen sulphide. Well itís actually a mixture of sulphur and\nsand that was picked up by one of my colleagues on his honeymoon, though\nyou see he was actually thinking about chemistry even on his honeymoon,\nthough I donít think he told his wife that. I have a feeling but I could wrong that I\nbought this sample in Oxfordshire where I used to live and I think\nitís actually from Brazil, though I could be wrong. So as we are using up all the sulphur now\nthe flame will die down until eventually it will go out. Cool, there you\ngo."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Sulfur exists as several allotropes, but which is the predominant one found in nature?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "S2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "S7 rings"}, {"label": "C", "text": "S8 rings"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What color flames is produced when sulfur burns in an oxygen atmosphere?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Yellow flame"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Blue flame"}, {"label": "C", "text": "White flame"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 53, "lesson": 10, "title": "Magnesium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/DJwOZkFB", "transcript": {"en": "Magnesium is one of the lightest elements.\nIt’s right at the beginning of the period table and, in fact, it’s the first of the\nlight metals that you can actually use. Lithium and sodium react violently with water so you\ncan’t really use them as a metal and beryllium is fantastically poisonous so unless you are\nusing it in the lab where you can be sure that nobody is going to touch it, it’s useless,\nso magnesium is the lightest metal you can use. So, for example, if you are trying to\nmake mobile phones that are really light, then you can make the frame of the mobile\nphone out of magnesium. You can use it for laptops. There is a professor in Germany,\nwho has promised to send me a laptop frame made of magnesium, but it hasn’t arrived\nyet. So another classroom classic. Normally comes\nalong in chemistry lesson number three I guess, time to combust a reactive metal in the air,\nso the reactive metal we are going to look at is magnesium. The other thing that is good about magnesium\nis that there is a lot of magnesium about in the world, so it is not an element that\nis difficult to get. If you look at this periodic table here, which is from Barcelona so it\nis in Catalan, the areas of these, each element are approximately the abundance in the world.\nSome of the rarer elements have a slightly bigger squares than they should do so you\ncan read the letters, but you see magnesium here is pretty large, so magnesium and sodium\nare pretty common, beryllium is much less common, and lithium is even less common than\nthat, so there is lots of magnesium. Magnesium is very light, it is very reactive,\nvery pliable metal, it is very nice, it is easily alloyed with things like aluminium\nand other light metals to make very strong, very robust materials. Used in construction,\nit’s used in high-performance components of cars. When I was a child when we got, had indigestion,\nwe were given ‘Milk of Magnesia’. Magnesium oxide in water which came in these really\nnice blue bottles, sort of white looking liquid, didn’t taste very nice, but it was meant\nto be good for you, I am not sure if it was. It is used in the hulls of ships, you know\nlike, warships, things like that, so incredibly strong, incredibly light but incredibly reactive\nif you give it enough energy. So we are going to combust it in the oxygen and see what happens. Magnesium as you know, burns, and one of the\nways that magnesium used to be used was for photographic flashlights, and you use bulbs\nlike these which contain magnesium, inside a bulb filled with oxygen. And for each photograph\nyou had to put this on the top of the camera. So I’ve got one here that I have taken out. So, if you look at it, so much heat has been\nproduced by this tiny amount of magnesium, that it has melted the glass. So, let’s see what happens when we light\nit. You can see, really fierce bright white light that classical glow, everyone has seen\nthis in the chemistry lab at school, fantastic reaction. It is one of the few metals which is meant\nto burn in nitrogen. In theory you can take a piece of magnesium, set fire to it in air\nso its burning well and then plunge it into nitrogen gas, and it should continue burning.\nI have tried this experiment lots of times and it’s never worked. In fact for 25 years\nI demonstrated this experiment to my lecture class when I was talking about nitrogen, and\nevery time, it didn’t work, and the students thought, the poor professor, he has been made\na fool of, it hasn’t worked and they didn’t know that it never worked and I would have\nbeen more surprised if it had done, but it taught them a bit about the chemistry of nitrogen\nand magnesium. Why did you keep doing it if it never worked? Because it is a really good experiment, because\nit got such a good reaction from the audience. Because it went wrong? Yes! You were playing the fool on purpose? Yes! So this is magnesium metal, but the magnesium\nmetal here is not the ribbon which we normally see in perhaps, scientific labs or perhaps\nin school labs, this is a very, very fine powder of magnesium, so what we are going\nto do in a moment is bring on a really very powerful torch, a gas flame and we are going\nto see what happens when we sprinkle a little of this material into the flame. Magnesium is also very important in all our\nlives, because magnesium is found in the green pigments in the leaves of all plants, in chlorophyll.\nChlorophyll is an organic molecule, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen and in the middle there\nis an atom of magnesium, and it is chlorophyll which catches the sunlight and transfers it\neventually to cause the reaction of carbon dioxide and water to make all the sugars and\nother things in the plant. If that didn’t happen none of us would be alive, because\nwe all rely either directly or indirectly on plants, to give us the energy to live. I don’t understand completely the mechanism\nof photosynthesis, because the energy that is absorbed by one molecule, is transferred\nto another and another one as it were along a chain, but the magnesium is very important,\nif you don’t have magnesium there it is not nearly as efficient.

Sodium\nis a very reactive metal, it is stored under an oil to stop air or moisture getting on\nit - stop it oxidising, stop it reacting - and as you can see it is a very soft metal, so\nhe is going to put his knife in and withdraw the lump of sodium, so there is about 2 kilos\nof sodium here, it's a really quite large rod. So we are going to cut a small sample\nof the sodium and we are going to see if we can explore some of its chemistry. Sodium is again a light metal, rather like\nlithium and it has a, a melting point about 96 degrees. So the sodium is a very, very shiny metal\nand as you can see as Neil cuts some off, you can see the quite nice shiny material.\nIt’s really quite beautiful. Reacts very, very quickly with air and also with water,\nyou form the oxide layer which is the white, or the hydroxide is the white crust on the\noutside. And many of you will know that if you drop\nsodium into water it reacts almost explosively. So we are going to go outside now, go get\nsome even bigger reactions, with the alkali metals. This is a dog bowl which is stoneware,\nit is very hard, not likely to break, unless I drop it on my toes. This is sodium, the metal that we cut a minute\nago and you can see there is quite a substantial amount of the sodium, and we are going to\npop it into the water and see what we can do with the reaction. Ok? So here we have\na bowl full of water and maybe, oh, a gram of sodium? So let’s see what happens, see\nwhat this reaction’s like. So it is reacting really, really quite quickly and really violently\nwith the water, and you can see it is fizzing around and it is generating lots and lots\nof hydrogen gas. And see now the heat from the reaction is burning away all of that hydrogen\nwhich is generating and you can see the orange sodium flame. That was um? That was good That is a bit of, a chunk of molten sodium\nhas come out of there mate. So, let’s burn that. Oh, it’s on your camera. Oh it is too! Sodium chloride is transparent through infrared\nlight and so here we have got a sheet of sodium chloride that has been stuck on to a glass\nvessel so that you can have infrared light going through it. Now this is a broken one,\nwhich my students have broken. Is that bit, have you got a, we need a needle\nNeil, or a pair of tweezers. So you can see here that these windows have\nbeen broken but you can see an interesting aspect of sodium chloride that when it breaks\nit forms cracks that form at right angles. Why is that? This is related to the structure of the atoms\ninside the crystal which are arranged in a sort of cubic arrangement. I have also got\nquite a nice crystal of sodium chloride over here which I don’t know if you can see has\nbeen turned into a table lamp. And if you switch it on it lights up. So this is just\na mass of natural sodium chloride from under the ground somewhere, probably in Cheshire\nor somewhere else like this where they have large underground salt mines, deposits. Ok so we have got another lump of sodium,\nand you can see it’s really nice and shiny. Ok? So we are going to pop that into that\nbig bucket of water. See what the chemical reaction is, ok? So here we go! So you can\nsee again, see the orange sodium spectrum as the sodium is getting excited as the hydrogen\nis burning all that heat. Whoa! Exciting! That is brilliant. That is much better. So sodium and water, excellent reaction. That was great.

{"page": 53, "lesson": 12, "title": "Aluminium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/qosc9gaL", "transcript": {"en": "We've decided to make a new video about aluminium because it's a long time over five years since we made the first one and... we didn't say very much. Aluminium is a surprisingly abundand element. If you look at this periodic table here, where the area of the different elements gives you a rough idea of the abundance you can see that aluminium is one of the most abundant metals up there with sodium, magnesium and calcium. More aluminum than potassium; about the same or perhaps even more than iron. We're never going to run out of aluminium. The problem with aluminium is that you don't find aluminium metal in nature as a metal. It's always tied up with other compounds; mostly with oxygen, in clays. You know what clays are, the sort of muddy stuff that you get stuck on your shoes when it's raining. To get the aluminium out of the clay, that is, to break the aluminium/oxygen bonds, which are very strong; requires a lot of energy, which comes from electricity. So, making aluminium is very energy intensive. That's why people like to recycle aluminium because once you've got it, it's worth preserving; but it's fantastically important because aluminium is a very light metal. And it's often used as an alloy because the aluminium alloys are stronger than the aluminium itself, so, if you're using it for aircraft or some other use like that where you want to combine lightness with strength then the stronger you can make it, the better. But when it was first made, in the 19th century, isolated as a metal it was terrifically valuable and there are stories of the French Emperor serving his honored guests with aluminium plates or aluminium cutlery while the less important people had silver or gold; but those times have passed and now you can get cupcakes and things like that surrounded by foil of aluminium. Aluminium is a very good metal for making things because it has a very thin coating of aluminium oxide on the surface which prevents it [from] reacting with things. But as soon as that coating goes it becomes very reactive. Alfred Worden:\nHadley Base, do you read Houston? David Scott:\nYeah. Now, 5 by, Joe. Worden:\nOkay. Worden:\nAnd I guess we're standing by for your high-gain alignment per the checklist. Scott:\nOkay, stand by. You may have seen our video where we put copper chloride in one of these cupcake holders... [First of all I'm going to dissolve some up and make a fairly concentrated solution. I'm going to place this here.] ...and what came out was this, or rather the copper chloride came out through the hole. [It starts boiling really quite nicely. Now, imagine I was doing this for my children who were quite small at that time, and... VOOSH!] And the aluminium was completely dissolved up forming aluminium chloride and copper metal. In my own research, aluminium is quite important; quite a lot of our equipment uses aluminium. Not so much for the high pressure tubing that we use because quite a lot of my reaserch involves high pressures but we use it for the metal blocks that we put round the tubing so that we can heat it up. Aluminium has a good electrical conductivity, and it's also easy to machine. This is a piece of equipment here where we have a tube going down the middle. You can see the diameter of the tube here. Around it is an aluminium block and an electrical heater. Now, this particular case there was an accident, or a mishap, because the thermocouple that was controlling the temperature of this fell out. So, the heater got hotter and hotter, and eventually, the aluminium melted and poured down here. And I think this is really beautiful. Well, fortunately, I was not in the lab or I would've got very angry with my students but I think when it happened it was quite exciting; this would have been glowing almost red because the melting point of aluminium is around 500 degrees centigrade. But then once it formed originally it was very shiny but quickly, it again developed the surface layer of aluminium oxide. If you have fine particles of Aluminium and blow them into a flame... ...then they will burn quite spectacularly and you form aluminium oxide. Now, on the face of it, aluminium oxide sounds a rather boring compound but it's really very useful and we use it quite a lot in our research in all sorts of different ways. It looks like a white powder. Not very exciting. But in our group this aluminium oxide has been a fantastic catalyst All sorts of reactions that we didn't expect have gone with this material. My students keep it in a bottle almost like a magic catalyst and I've only been given a little to show you. It acts as a solid acid which can be used at very high temperature and will get various acid-catalyzed reactions of organic compounds. It will make ethers, we have made various alkynes and a whole series of different compounds and my students still use it very much. If you melt the aluminium oxide, which we can't do here but can be done industrially, you can make single crystals which are transparent like glass and then you can grow a single crystal tube, like this one, which because it's a single crystal, it's terrifically strong. It's the defects that make something weak and so if you have just one crystal there are no defects and so it's very strong. So you can put a very high pressure inside this tube without it blowing up. Brady:\nBut you could make that tube out of metal, professor. Professor:\nBut,  if you have a metal then you can't see what's going on inside, and we're using these tubes for photochemical reactions. So, we take a light like this, and shine it on the chemicals going through the tube under high pressure and we can convert one chemical into another. We can do this very efficiently because the light is absorbed by the molecules that we want to react and so we dont waste the energy on everything else. And using LEDs, which are a very efficient light source, you can get a process that is very energy efficient and it all depends on having this sapphire tube. This is synthetic sapphire. The real sapphire, the gems, have impurities in them, of other metals, which give them the nice colors, particularly the blue. Princess Kate has a blue sapphire ring which belonged to her husband's mother, Princess Di, before her. And so, these are very valuable ones. But synthetic sapphire is also expensive but not in the same class as a natural gem. Brady:\nWhat can nature do that the guys at the sapphire factory can't do? Professor:\nNature has time. The people who grow this will take hours or days or perhaps weeks to grow it. Nature can spend thousands or millions of years growing a particular gem and therefore they can heat it up and cool it down in natural surroundings, in volcanoes... or whatever far more slowly than people can afford to do industrially. There's a lot of argument whether you should call it aluminum or aluminium Now, there isn't a totally correct one because both forms are acceptable. But, all or nearly all chemists use aluminium because it's very important to use a standardized nomenclature right across the world. And I think aluminium sounds nicer. Student:\nHi professor, my question is is it aluminum or aluminium? 'Cause I want to know what to call my aluminium model. Apparantly, there was a decision in 1990 by IUPAC the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry that it should definately be called A L U M I N I U M but then they relented three years later and said you could use aluminum as well. But if you're a serious chemist you really need to say aluminium, because otherwise people won't find your papers, your publications, when they search because they'll almost certainly put an \"i\"' in the name. Aluminium is frequently used or used [to be] frequently used kkfor sauce pans, for cooking in because it's easy to make, easy to machine and particularly when people used electric stoves it was easy to make a flat bottom so that you got good contact between the electric element and the sauce pan. The problem with aluminium sauce pans is that if you're cooking some fairly acidic food, for example boiling lemons or rhubarb something like that which is quite acidic you can dissolve some of the aluminium and people got quite worried about getting aluminium in their food. Also, if you cook red cabbage, which is an indicator; blue for alkali, red for acid, then if you boil it in an aluminium sauce pan it goes blue. And earlier in my carreer I used a red cabbage together with a white one to make a Union Jack, a U.K. flag with a mixture of red and blue-red cabbage and the white from the white cabbage. Unfortionately, I've lost the photo; Brady is very cross with me. But it was quite fun cooking it in the kitchen. I did it once myself, but it was such a lot of work that the second time a got one of my students to do it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why do the professor’s students find aluminium oxide (alumina) such a useful catalyst?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is a fine powder"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is solid acid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is a solid alkali"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "A single crystal sapphire tube is very strong, mainly because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It has no defects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is transparent"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is composed of aluminium oxide"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In nature, aluminium is most frequently found bonded to which element?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carbon"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nitrogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oxygen"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

One spoonful. Two. Three. Soon, you're powered up by the energy surge that comes from your meal. But how did that energy get into your bowl? Energy exists in the form of sugars made by the plant your cereal came from, like wheat or corn. As you can see, carbon is the chemical backbone, and plants get their fix of it in the form of carbon dioxide, CO2, from the air that we all breath. But how does a plant's energy factory, housed in the stroma of the chloroplast, turn a one carbon gas, like CO2, into a six carbon solid, like glucose? If you're thinking photosynthesis, you're right. But photosynthesis is divided into two steps. The first, which stores energy from the sun in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. And the second, the Calvin cycle, that captures carbon and turns it into sugar. This second phase represents one of nature's most sustainable production lines. And so with that, welcome to world's most miniscule factory. The starting materials? A mix of CO2 molecules from the air, and preassembled molecules called ribulose biphosphate, or RuBP, each containing five carbons. The initiator? An industrious enzyme named rubisco that welds one carbon atom from a CO2 molecule with the RuBP chain to build an initial six carbon sequence. That rapidly splits into two shorter chains containing three carbons each and called phosphoglycerates, or PGAs, for short. Enter ATP, and another chemical called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, or just NADPH. ATP, working like a lubricant, delivers energy, while NADPH affixes one hydrogen to each of the PGA chains, changing them into molecules called glyceraldehyde 3 phosphates, or G3Ps. Glucose needs six carbons to form, made from two molecules of G3P, which incidentally have six carbons between them. So, sugar has just been manufactured, right? Not quite. The Calvin cycle works like a sustainable production line, meaning that those original RuBPs that kicked things off at the start, need to be recreated by reusing materials within the cycle now. But each RuBP needs five carbons and manufacturing glucose takes a whole six. Something doesn't add up. The answer lies in one phenomenal fact. While we've been focusing on this single production line, five others have been happening at the same time. With six conveyor belts moving in unison, there isn't just one carbon that gets soldered to one RuBP chain, but six carbons soldered to six RuBPs. That creates 12 G3P chains instead of just two, meaning that all together, 36 carbons exist: the precise number needed to manufacture sugar, and rebuild those RuBPs. Of the 12 G3Ps pooled together, two are siphoned off to form that energy rich six carbon glucose chain. The one fueling you via your breakfast. Success! But back on the manufacturing line, the byproducts of this sugar production are swiftly assembled to recreate those six RuBPs. That requires 30 carbons, the exact number contained by the remaining 10 G3PS. Now a molecular mix and match occurs. Two of the G3Ps are welded together forming a six carbon sequence. By adding a third G3P, a nine carbon chain is built. The first RuBP, made up of five carbons, is cast from this, leaving four carbons behind. But there's no wastage here. Those are soldered to a fourth G3P molecule, making a seven carbon chain. Added to a fifth G3P molecule, a ten carbon chain is created, enough now to craft two more RuBPs. With three full RuBPs recreated from five of the ten G3Ps, simply duplicating this process will renew the six RuBP chains needed to restart the cycle again. So the Calvin cycle generates the precise number of elements and processes required to keep this biochemical production line turning endlessly. And it's just one of the 100s of cycles present in nature. Why so many? Because if biological production processes were linear, they wouldn't be nearly as efficient or successful at using energy to manufacture the materials that nature relies upon, like sugar. Cycles create vital feedback loops that repeatedly reuse and rebuild ingredients crafting as much as possible out of the planet's available resources. Such as that sugar, built using raw sunlight and carbon converted in plant factories to become the energy that powers you and keeps the cycles revolving in your own life."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following statements is true about the Calvin cycle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It requires the presence of sunlight"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It happens in the stroma of a chloroplast"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It can happen if it has enough ATP even if no NADPH is available"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) has the job of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Connecting carbon from CO2 to RuBP"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Catalysing the reconstruction of ribulose bisphosphate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Delivering hydrogen for the conversion of G3P to PGA"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ensuring that NADPH delivers the hydrogen to the correct location"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How many repeats of the Calvin cycle are needed to make one glucose molecule?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "9"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The correct sequence for reactants in the Calvin cycle is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "RuBP ⇒ NADPH ⇒ PGA ⇒ G3P ⇒ Glucose"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rubisco ⇒ G3P ⇒ ATP ⇒ PGA ⇒ Glucose"}, {"label": "C", "text": "RuBP ⇒ PGA ⇒ ATP ⇒ NADPH ⇒ G3P"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rubisco ⇒ PGA ⇒ ATP ⇒ G3P ⇒ Glucose"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Cycles are beneficial in living systems because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are efficient"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They allow repeated use of limited resources"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They save energy"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

Actually, just pick up all of them and take a look. This standard 52-card deck has been used for centuries. Everyday, thousands just like it are shuffled in casinos all over the world, the order rearranged each time. And yet, every time you pick up a well-shuffled deck like this one, you are almost certainly holding an arrangement of cards that has never before existed in all of history. How can this be? The answer lies in how many different arrangements of 52 cards, or any objects, are possible. Now, 52 may not seem like such a high number, but let's start with an even smaller one. Say we have four people trying to sit in four numbered chairs. How many ways can they be seated? To start off, any of the four people can sit in the first chair. One this choice is made, only three people remain standing. After the second person sits down, only two people are left as candidates for the third chair. And after the third person has sat down, the last person standing has no choice but to sit in the fourth chair. If we manually write out all the possible arrangements, or permutations, it turns out that there are 24 ways that four people can be seated into four chairs, but when dealing with larger numbers, this can take quite a while. So let's see if there's a quicker way. Going from the beginning again, you can see that each of the four initial choices for the first chair leads to three more possible choices for the second chair, and each of those choices leads to two more for the third chair. So instead of counting each final scenario individually, we can multiply the number of choices for each chair: four times three times two times one to achieve the same result of 24. An interesting pattern emerges. We start with the number of objects we're arranging, four in this case, and multiply it by consecutively smaller integers until we reach one. This is an exciting discovery. So exciting that mathematicians have chosen to symbolize this kind of calculation, known as a factorial, with an exclamation mark. As a general rule, the factorial of any positive integer is calculated as the product of that same integer and all smaller integers down to one. In our simple example, the number of ways four people can be arranged into chairs is written as four factorial, which equals 24. So let's go back to our deck. Just as there were four factorial ways of arranging four people, there are 52 factorial ways of arranging 52 cards. Fortunately, we don't have to calculate this by hand. Just enter the function into a calculator, and it will show you that the number of possible arrangements is 8.07 x 10^67, or roughly eight followed by 67 zeros. Just how big is this number? Well, if a new permutation of 52 cards were written out every second starting 13.8 billion years ago, when the Big Bang is thought to have occurred, the writing would still be continuing today and for millions of years to come. In fact, there are more possible ways to arrange this simple deck of cards than there are atoms on Earth. So the next time it's your turn to shuffle, take a moment to remember that you're holding something that may have never before existed and may never exist again."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The symbol “!” in math is usually _________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Called an exclamation mark"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Means that everything before the symbol is said with extra enthusiasm"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Called a factorial"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Called a product"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which symbol do mathematicians use as a short hand to describe the product (multiplication) of an integer and all smaller integers down to 1 [n x (n-1) x (n-2) x … x 1]?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "?"}, {"label": "B", "text": "*"}, {"label": "C", "text": "!"}, {"label": "D", "text": "&"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "It’s Saturday morning, and you have 3 errands to complete today: get groceries, call your friend and fix your bike.

{"page": 53, "lesson": 15, "title": "Pixar: The math behind the movies - Tony DeRose", "category": "Visual Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/pixar-the-math-behind-the-movies-tony-derose", "transcript": {"en": "At Pixar, we're all about telling stories, but one story that hasn't been told very much is the huge degree to which math is used in the production of our films. The math that you're learning in middle school and high school is used all the time at Pixar. So, let's start with a very simple example. Anybody recognize this guy? (Cheers) Yeah, so this is Woody from Toy Story, and let's ask Woody to, say, walk across the stage from, say, left to right, just like that. So, believe it or not, you just saw a ton of mathematics. Where is it? Well, to explain that, it's important to understand that artists and designers think in terms of shape and images but computers think in terms of numbers and equations. So, to bridge those two worlds we use a mathematical concept called coordinate geometry, right? That is, we lay down a coordinate system with x describing how far something is to the right and y describing how high something is. So, with these coordinates we can describe where Woody is at any instant in time. For instance, if we know the coordinates of the lower left corner of that image, then we know where the rest of the image is. And in that little sliding animation we saw a second ago, that motion we call translation, the x coordinate started with a value of one, and it ended with a value of about five. So, if we want to write that in mathematics, we see that the x at the end is four bigger than x at the start. So, in other words, the mathematics of translation is addition. Alright? How about scaling? That is making something bigger or smaller. Any guesses as to what the mathematics of scaling might be? Dilation, multiplication, exactly. If you're going to make something twice as big, you need to mulitply the x and the y coordinates all by two. So, this shows us that the mathematics of scaling is mulitiplication. Okay? How about this one? How about rotation? Alright, spinning around. The mathematics of rotation is trigonometry. So, here's an equation that expresses that. It looks a little scary at first. You'll probably get this in eighth or ninth grade. If you find yourselves sitting in trigonometry class wondering when you're ever going to need this stuff, just remember that any time you see anything rotate in one of our films, there's trigonometry at work underneath. I first fell in love with mathematics in seventh grade. Any seventh graders? A few of you? Yeah. My seventh grade science teacher showed me how to use trigonometry to compute how high the rockets that I was building was going. I just thought that was amazing, and I've been enamored with math ever since. So, this is kind of old mathematics. Mathematics that's been known and, you know, developed by the old dead Greek guys. And there's a myth out there that all the interesting mathematics has already been figured out, in fact all of mathematics has been figured out. But the real story is that new mathematics is being created all the time. And some of it is being created at Pixar. So, I'd like to give you an example of that. So, here are some characters from some of our early films: Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc. and Toy Story 2. Anybody know who the blue character in the upper left is? It's Dory. Okay, that was easy. Here's a little harder one. Anybody know who's the character in the lower right? Al McWhiggin from Al's Toy Barn, exactly. The thing to notice about these characters is they're really complicated. Those shapes are really complicated. In fact, the toy cleaner, I have an example, the toy cleaner there in the middle, here's his hand. You can imagine how fun it was to bring this through airport security. His hand is a really complicated shape. It's not just a bunch of spheres and cylinders stuck together, right? And not only is it complicated, but it has to move in complicated ways. So, I'd like to tell you how we do that, and to do that I need to tell you about midpoints. So, here's a couple of points, A and B, and the line segment between them. We're going to start out first in two dimensions. The midpoint, M, is the point that splits that line segment in the middle, right? So, that's the geometry. To make equations and numbers, we again introduce a coordinate system, and if we know the coordinates of A and B, we can easily compute the coordinates of M just by averaging. You now know enough to work at Pixar. Let me show you. So, I'm going to do something slightly terrifying and move to a live demo here. So, what I have is a four-point polygon here, and it's going to be my job to make a smooth curve out of this thing. And I'm going to do it just using the idea of midpoints. So, the first thing I'm going to do is an operation I'll call split, which adds midpoints to all those edges. So, I went from four points to eight points, but it's no smoother. I'm going to make it a little bit smoother by moving all of these points from where they are now to the midpoint of their clockwise neighbor. So, let me animate that for you. I'm going to call that the averaging step. So, now I've got eight points, they're a little bit smoother, my job is to make a smooth curve, so what do I do? Do it again. Split and average. So, now I've got sixteen points. I'm going to put those two steps, split and average, together into something I'll call subdivide, which just means split and then average. So, now I've got 32 points. If that's not smooth enough, I'll do more. I'll get 64 points. Do you see a smooth curve appearing here from those original points? And that's how we create the shapes of our charcters. But remember, I said a moment ago it's not enough just to know the static shape, the fixed shape. We need to animate it. And to animate these curves, the cool thing about subdivision. Did you see the aliens in Toy Story? You know that sound they make, \"Ooh\"? Ready? So, the way we animate these curves is simply by animating the original four points. \"Ooh.\" Alright, I think that's pretty cool, and if you don't, the door is there, it doesn't get any better than that, so. This idea of splitting and averaging also holds for surfaces. So, I'll split, and I'll average. I'll split, and I'll average. Put those together into subdivide, and this how we actually create the shapes of all of our surface characters in three dimensions. So, this idea of subdivision was first used in a short film in 1997 called Geri's Game. And Geri actually made a cameo apperance in Toy Story 2 as the toy cleaner. Each of his hands was the first time we ever used subdivision. So, each hand was a subdivision surface, his face was a subdivision surface, so was his jacket. Here's Geri's hand before subdivision, and here's Geri's hand after subdivision, so subdivision just goes in and smooths out all those facets, and creates the beautiful surfaces that you see on the screen and in the theaters. Since that time, we've built all of our characters this way. So, here's Merida, the lead character from Brave. Her dress was a subdivision surface, her hands, her face. The faces and hands of all the clansman were subdivision surfaces. Today we've seen how addition, multiplication, trigonometry and geometry play a roll in our films. Given a little more time, I could show you how linear algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus also play a roll. The main thing I want you to go away with today is to just remember that all the math that you're learning in high school and actually up through sophomore college we use all the time, everyday, at Pixar.

How'd you get from here to there? How fast did you go? Did you run? Walk? Did you even go in a straight line? Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics look more like physics physics. You'll need more panels. More panels, please! Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place. So I can see each one records where Andrew is at a different time. That's great. But it would be easier to see what's going on if we could cut out all the hundreds of panels and stack them up like a flip book. Right, now let's flip through the book so that we can see one panel after another getting through 24 in every second. See! I told you it was an animation. Now you can see me walking along. Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book is just one way of recording the way I'm moving. It's how animation, or even movies, work. As it turns out, at my walking speed, it takes two seconds to get past each fence post, and they're spaced four meters apart. So we can calculate my velocity -- how fast I'm moving through space - - is two meters per second. But I could've worked that out from the panels without flipping through them. From the edge of the flip book, you can see all of the copies of the fence posts and all of the copies of Andrew and he's in a slightly different place in each one. Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew when we flip through 24 pages every second, including his speed of motion, just by looking. No need to flip through at all. The edge of this flip book is known as a space-time diagram of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it, space and time. We call the line that represents Andrew's journey his world line. If i jog instead of walking, I might be able to get past a fence post every second. He's not very athletic. Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge, we can do the same analysis as before. The world line for Andrew jogging is more tilted over than the world line for Andrew walking. We can tell he's going twice as fast as before without flipping the panels. But here's the clever bit. In physics, it's always good to view things from other perspectives. After all, the laws of physics should be the same for everyone or no one will obey them. So let's rethink our cartoon and have the camera follow Andrew jogging along as the fence posts approach and pass behind him. Still viewing it as a flip book of panels, we don't need to redraw anything. We simply move all of the cutout frames slightly until Andrew's tilted world line becomes completely vertical. To see why, let's flip it. Yes, now I'm stationery, just jogging on the spot, in the center of the panel. On the edge of the flip book, my world line was going straight upwards. The fence posts are coming past me. It's now their world lines that are tilted. This rearrangement of the panels is known as a Galilean transformation, and it lets us analyze physics from someeone else's perspective. In this case, mine. After all, it's always good to see things from other points of view, especially when the viewers are moving at different speeds. So long as the speeds aren't too high. If you're a cosmic ray moving at the speed of light, our flip book of your point of view falls apart. To stop that from happening, we'll have to glue panels together. Instead of a stack of separate panels, we'll need a solid block of space-time, which we'll come to in the next animation."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "We showed how spacetime diagrams are like the edge of a flipbook, and so can be created by stacking up a series of animation panels.

So it is\nquite a cool experiment, you take some molten gallium and then you\nsubmerge it or you put it underneath a layer of sulphuric\nacid. The sulphuric acid reacts with the gallium to form gallium\nsulphate and it changes the surface tension, so it all pulls\nup into a ball and then relaxes and there is this really neat\noscillating reaction where you get sulphate on the surface or no\nsulphate on the surface. So you see big changes in surface\ntension and the piece of gallium is seen to beat like a heart\nso we thought we would try that today with a bit of gallium\nwhich I am trying to melt in my hand right now. Many years ago, a professor bet me a hundred\npounds, when a hundred pounds was a lot of money, that\nthe melting point of gallium was lower than that of caesium\nand I said it was the other way round, but I was not courageous\nenough to take up the bet or now I would be rich. So this is a small nugget of gallium and as\nyou can see if I tap it on the hot plate it is real metal so\nnow we are going to try and melt it, hopefully in my hand. In my first video about gallium, I said that\nit was not a very interesting element with not much, many applications\nand we have had emails from people who were outraged.\nThere is one email from a gentleman in America whose\ncompany makes tonnes of gallium salts that have quite\nimportant applications and of course gallium is particularly\nimportant in new generation of compounds, so-called semi-conductors,\nthat are used in the electronics industry. So if I stand and hold it for long enough,\nin theory, the temperature should come from my hand, the\nheat should come from my hand, so it should melt the gallium\nand then eventually we should have a small amount of\nliquid. So gallium, you can form an amalgam with this\nmaterial, with all sorts of different materials like indium and\ntin. And in fact indium, tin and gallium is used as the material\ninside many, many thermometers which are used in the medical\nindustry because it is not as toxic as mercury which\nwas traditionally used. You may have heard of Mendeleev. He\nwas the guy that sort of conceived or brought together the\nperiodic table and at the time that he did this at about 1870,\ngallium hadn’t been discovered, so he predicted its chemical\nand physical properties and he called it eka-aluminium,\napproximately 5 years after that it was found using a spectroscope.\nSo now we see it is melted, it looks just like a\nlittle ball of mercury rolling around on my hand. You can see the\nthick skin that has developed the surface tension causing\nit to form such a beautiful bulb. We are going to take out our\nmolten gallium and we are going to put it under a layer of\ndilute sulphuric acid, about the same strength as battery acid,\nso now we are going to make the acid. And to do that we\nare going to dilute concentrated sulphuric acid with water. Now\nit is always important to remember that when you dilute\nacid you always put acid into water because the reaction can\nbe exothermic and we want to dissipate the heat in the water\nso that it does not squirt up on our faces. The water was\nroom temperature, but if I hold the measuring cylinder here\nit is actually very hot, it is maybe 40, 50, 60oC. So now before\nwe do our experiment we have got to allow it to cool.\nWe do that by simply running cold water outside the tube. So this is the gallium that we melted on our\nhand, now let’s see what happens when we add the sulphuric\nacid. Wow, did you see that? I did. What happened? So the shape of the ball or the lump of gallium\nhas changed, because we’ve changed it surface properties,\nwe’ve made gallium sulphate on the surface. The\nsurface tension has got higher and it has pulled up into a\nnice ball, ok. So that’s the first step of the beating heart.\nWhat we’ve seen is the gallium which was relaxed flat on the\nsurface has pulled up really quite sharply and that is the first\nstage, or the in- beat of the heart, now we’ve got to make\nthe heart relax. So what we are going to do is use dichromate.\nDichromate is a fantastic oxidant and we are going to put\na small amount of it in and see what happens. So gallium, I realise now is named after France.\nIt was discovered by a Frenchman and its name comes\nfrom the old name for France, Gaul. So what we are doing in this experiment, we\nare changing the surface tension of the gallium, so these are\nthe forces that hold the liquid into a ball or allow it to\nwet and flatten on the surface. So when the gallium is naked, ok?\nIt’s actually quite flat and it wets the surface. But when we\nput it under sulphuric acid we form gallium sulphate on\nthe surface, this increases the surface tension and then pulls\nthe gallium so it is in a nice proud ball. What we then do is\nwe dribble a small amount of dichromate solution in, which removes\nthe sulphate from the surface and allows the gallium\nto go flat, and if we add the required amount of dichromate\nto the amount of acid then we can get the ball to\nflatten and come back up, flatten and come back up, so it looks\nlike a beating heart. At the moment we are really quite excited\nat Nottingham because Steve Liddle, my periodic videos colleague,\nhas made a new compound in which he has got an atom\nof uranium to bond to an atom of gallium and this is exciting\nbecause this is the first time that chemists have ever seen\na bond between these two atoms. It sort of turns a terracottery colour, it\nis really a deep orangey brown, it is a bit like brick dust actually. Of course they are not naked uranium and naked\ngallium but each of them have other things bonded to them\nbut it is the first time that anybody has seen a gallium-uranium\nbond. It was one of those great moments you know,\nbeing a chemist is like being on a rollercoaster,\nyou have some days when you wonder why am I doing this? And you\nhave fantastic days where you totally remember\nwhy you are doing this. Because it is to be the first, to be\nthe first person who has ever made this particular, you know filling\nthe gap, whatever it is. It is a real thrill when you\nare the first person to make a compound that does not exist out\nin the galaxy and space, it has never existed on our planet\nbefore but now we have made it for the first time. That’s\na really good thing to do We are really very excited! A new union has\nbeen formed within the periodic table and it has been\ndone here at Nottingham."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "As Pete reminds us in the video, what is very important to remember when you want to dilute an acid with water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To put acid into water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To put water into acid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The order doesn’t matter"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Mendeleev predicted the properties of gallium before it had been discovered.

{"page": 53, "lesson": 18, "title": "Copper - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/2DUz9zMA", "transcript": {"en": "Okay weíre going to be looking today at copper.\nThis is something looking back at the old video, itís a short video and there isnít\nany experimentation in it so I thought weíd do something a bit practical. Copper is an element which people are very\nfamiliar with because itís such a characteristic coloured metal, sort of reddish colour, though\nit gets darker when oxide forms. But itís quite a soft metal and you can cut it quite\neasily if you have a cutter like this which has steel blades, it will just dig into the\nmetal and it should just cut off. When you cut the metal you get this very nice, shiny,\nfresh surface coloured just like copper. This is a ball of copper, copper metal. As\nyou might imagine itís a ball of metal so therefore it is quite dense and heavy. I mean\nitís not as dense as, I think Steve told me this morning, that if we had a ball this\nsize of plutonium he told me it would weigh about a kilo and a half so he thought. So\nitís not quite as heavy as that but still itís pretty heavy and dense. So this is a very, very nice sample of very\nfine copper wire. So the copper wire here is, what width is this? This isÖ phew! Point\nzero, Iím not even going toÖthatís just too small, so itís point one of a millimetre. So inside the beaker weíve got a solution\ncalled sodium potassium tartrate, so no copper in there at the moment. Weíre going to introduce\nthat through this. This is a solution of copper sulphate. Copper is very popular for architectural use\nbecause if you put it on the roofs of buildings it then reacts, particularly with carbon dioxide\nin the air, to give a very nice green colour. First of all though we need to heat this to\nabout 50∞C, and to the sodium potassium tartrate we need to add some very weak, hydrogen\nperoxide so this is only 3% hydrogen peroxide, so in it goes. We need to make sure they mix\ntogether which is why thereís a stirring bar at the bottom there stirring away. Okay\nso thatís stirring nicely, so as I said sodium potassium tartrate and hydrogen peroxide and\nwe need to add only one mill so thatís 1cm3 of the copper sulphate. The copper wire here is very, very high grade,\nthis is grade one copper wire and itís point one of a millimetre in diameter and you can\nsee the wonderful copperas lustre coming off the side there. What do you mean by grade one copper? So this is very high purity, this is like\n99.99% copper, used for electronics fabrications and high quality research samples. Itís also used for electrical wiring, in\nfact itís used so much that in a country like the UK each person has about 175 kilos\nof copper associated with each person, in the piping, the wiring and so on. The problem\nis that in many other countries, for example in China, people have very much less copper\nassociated with them, there isnít so much electrical wiring in rural parts of China.\nAnd if everybody in China had the same amount of copper associated with them as those in\nEngland or America or Canada there wouldnít be enough copper in all the known deposits\naround the world. Copper is actually necessary for life, plants\nand animals use copper. But actually you can have a disease called Wilsonís disease which\nbasically your body canít metabolise copper properly, itís actually an inherited disease. Ready? Whatís going on there is itís producing\na lot of gas so itís reacting to form a complex. And itís going from the potassium tartrate\ncomplex there to well, its producing carbon dioxide and oxygen, mainly oxygen gas is being\nproduced which is why youíre seeing the fizzing. And itís become copper oxide, cuprous oxide\nactually. Copper is found as a metal lying around in\nvarious places in the world. I believe the name came from the island of Cyprus in the\nmiddle of the Mediterranean, but copper has always been know even in pre-historic times\npeople found small amounts of copper. But as we use more and more copper people have\nhad to dig deeper and deeper mines. The mine in Chile where those very brave miners were\nentombed for more than two months and then rescued was a copper mine. And to get the\nmetal that we need weíre going to have to go deeper and deeper and deeper into the earth. So what weíve got in there now is cuprous\noxide itís copper 1 oxide. And itís actually gone from what was a kind of clear see-through,\nall right itís got a colour on it, but see-through solution to something thatís very cloudy.\nSo what weíve got there is a precipitate of copper oxide. Copper is very good because it has very high\nthermal and electrical conductivity. What that means is that heat flows through it very\nwell and also electricity. If you make wires for electrical transmission out of copper,\nwhen the electricity goes through them you get very much less heating than say if you\nmade the wires out of iron, and all this heating is of course lost energy. Youíd do even better\nif you made the wires out of silver, but silver is too expensive. OK. So letís see if we can change this reaction\nback. So at the moment it started out as being about 50∞C and itís shot up to about 63∞C,\nI imagine it was even hotter than that when it originally changed colour. So weíll see\nif we can take it back, Iíll put that back in. I actually bought this from the British Geological\nSurvey which is just down the road from here, I think it is in Keyworth I think. And I just\nsaw this and it was a Christmas present from my husband and I picked it out. I just think\nitís really cool actually. What did your husband think of getting that\nas a Christmas present? He knows what Iím like! So he buys these\nthings for me he knows Iím a bit of a magpie, I like to collect shiny things, and pretty\nthings, thatís my copper. So the colour is gradually changing, itís\ngone from orange and now kind of a murky yellow. You can see itís kind of green now. And again\na gradual change, it wasnít a sudden spontaneous straight back to being blue and see-through,\nyou know clear. Now weíve got back to that clear solution. And again you can see on the\nstirrer bar all the bubbles of the oxygen, little bit of C02 forming on that. Most organisms, you and me, use iron in our\nblood to transport oxygen, thatís what makes our blood red. But in some sorts of crustaceans,\ncrabs and lobsters, theyíre different they use copper. They use a compound called hemocyanin,\nitís a blue compound of copper. Cyanine is some classical word for blue. So they really\nhave blue blood. And these hemocyanin use two atoms of copper in each molecule to transport\nthe oxygen around the body of the crab or lobster. But itís not nearly as good as haemoglobin,\nso if you start running after a crab or lobster it quickly gets tired compared to running\nafter a rabbit or something like that, which can keep going faster than you can."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the color of copper sulfate and many copper compounds?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Red"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Blue"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Green"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

You need to use\ncobalt in the magnets in the colour television or the old\nsort of colour television not the ones with LCD screens because\nthe magnetic fields from larger magnets could\naffect the electron guns and so spoil the colours so you need\na very small magnet on your loud speaker or the colours\nall go funny.

{"page": 53, "lesson": 20, "title": "Iron - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/kcz3HyJi", "transcript": {"en": "The thermite reaction which is the reaction\nof aluminium and iron oxide is used to make iron and because\naluminium has much stronger bonds to oxygen than iron that\nthe reaction produces an enormous amount of heat and you\ncan use this for welding pieces of metals together. So this is a thermite mixture, it is a mixture\nof iron oxide and aluminium powder and we are going to do some\nredox chemistry and we are going to generate some\nmolten iron which will hopefully stream from the bottom\nof the flower pot. So here you can see the black particles\nof the iron oxide and the silver particles are the aluminium\npowder. So we get some heat on this and we start an instantaneous\nredox reaction so the aluminium and the iron oxide\nswap oxygens so the aluminium will become oxidised and\nthe iron will become reduced hopefully we will generate\na lot of molten iron which should come from the bottom of\nthe test tube … of the flower pot. Alright! Right. Now there is a story about students in Berkley\nthat some students, or group of students, decided to\ndo a practical joke on a tram of the sort that has one door where\nyou go in and another when you go out. So a big group of\nstudents queued onto the tram and got into the front and there\nwere enough of them so they could actually come out at\nthe end at the other door and form a loop so they were just\ngoing round and round and round so the tram could not\nleave because they were just more and more people getting\non. We’re going to run out of tape. And while they were doing this, other students\nwent down under the tram and set off two thermite reactions\nand welded the metal wheels of the tram to the steel\nrails so that when the tram tried to leave, when the students\neventually stopped going round and round, it was firmly welded\nto the tracks and could not move at all. It’s gone out. Tell us about what is going on mate! So instantly the thermite reaction starts\nand you can see that it’s so hot that it burnt a whole through\nthe bottom of that terracotta flower pot. But if we go in close\nnow Brady, you can see all that really quite nice molten\niron. Now that is so hot that the iron itself has melted and it\nhas formed this really quite big goo in the bottom on the\nsand. Do you encourage these sorts of practical\njokes? No, no, no, no ,no, our students are far more\nresponsible. So as soon as the fire work, or the sparkler,\nhit the top of the thermite reaction, in the top of here, it\nstarted obviously, instantaneous redox reaction. So this is where\nthe metals were fighting for the oxygen, the aluminium\nwon that battle and the aluminium came out of this reaction\nas aluminium oxide. The iron was reduced and we can see\nthat now in the bottom which is really hot so I am not going\nto get too close but you can see all of this really, really\nhot iron. The iron was molten, it dribbled out through the bottom\nof the flower pot and it is now cooling. It didn’t dribble out of the bottom of the\nflower pot. Well it smashed its way out of the flower\npot. Well you can say that iron is in my blood,\nit is in your blood as well. It is iron that gives haemoglobin\nthe red pigment in your blood, its red colour. So the reaction we saw was about 5 minutes\nago and the iron that was generated is still glowing red hot\nand you can see it has fused itself to the bottom half of the\nflower pot, which it broke in its tumultuous step forward. It is an absolutely essential element to life,\nexcept for crabs which use copper but you will have to hear\nabout that later. So iron is a really, really abundant metal\nwhich is used in lots and lots of structural material, so you get\nto see lots of pieces of iron around, some of the racking\nand even in fact some of these pieces of equipment have got\nhigh iron content. They have got other elements in them\nto form alloys like stainless steel. I have an extremely long standing interest\nin its chemistry and in particular, I made one compound of\niron so called iron tetracarbonyl which had 4 groups round it\nand everybody had expected that it would have a shape like one\nof these. Shaped with tetrahedron like that whereas, in fact,\nit had a much more irregular shape, the 4 groups were arranged\nlike this, and so every since this, every time I hear\nthe word iron I get quite excited. So this is iron wire, ok, and as you can it\nis a very small wire. It is 0.2 in diameter and you can see the\nshiny material underneath is iron that has not undergone\noxidation so this is where it has been protected from the oxygen\nin the air now if we look at the iron at the top we can see\nthat this looks really familiar especially because it looks like\nsome of the rust which we can see at the bottom of some of our cars.\nSo here is some iron oxide on top of the iron. The very first chemical experiment I did the\nchemical reaction was with iron and I think the same is true\nfor many generations of school children. I heated up\niron and sulphur together and made iron sulphide sort of blackish\nsolid but then we put acid on it and got a terrible\nsmell of bad eggs and this was my introduction to chemistry\nand I really loved it."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Most of the iron in the Earth’s crust is found combined with oxygen in iron dioxide minerals such as…", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Magnetite and haematite"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Magnetite and pyrite"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Magnetite and quartz"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which are the products of the exothermic thermite reaction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Iron and aluminium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Iron oxide and aluminium"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Aluminium oxide and iron"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 53, "lesson": 21, "title": "Scandium - Periodic Table of Videos", "category": "Physical Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/hAZjXCFe", "transcript": {"en": "Two or three days ago, I got a letter from\none of our fans and it’s different from any other letter that we have ever had, because\nthis fan, Young, has attached to it a sample of an element and what’s more it is an element\nthat I had never seen. It’s scandium. It’s only a small piece\nbut according to my colleague Steve, it’s a very expensive element, so this might be\nquite valuable, and scandium is a really interesting element, much more interesting than I realised,\nwhen I first talked about it on the video. Scandium is an element which chemists usually\nignore, I have never used scandium in any of my research. It was one of the elements that Mendeleev\npredicted ought to exist when he first devised the periodic table, when he made it there\nwere lots of elements which were not known, but what he did was to predict that there\nwere holes in various places where he felt that there ought to be an element and because\nobviously these elements did not have names, he called them Ekea boron or Ekea aluminium\nor Ekea silicon meaning underneath those elements. And the triumph of the periodic table was\nthat people actually discovered these elements. And the first one that was discovered was\nthe element Gallium (Ekea Aluminium) and the second one was Ekea Boron which is scandium.\nNow you might think that it is a bit surprising because if you look at a modern periodic table,\nscandium and boron are really quite a long way apart but in the original way that Medeleev\nstarted the periodic table when he wrote it down first, scandium and boron came very close\ntogether because both of them, have three electrons in their outer shell which makes\ntheir chemistry quite similar. Of course Medeleev did not know about electrons, but he guessed\nfrom looking at titanium which has four electrons and calcium which has two that he thought\nthere was something missing and what is also interesting about these three elements that\nhe predicted is that they all ended up with names of countries. There was gallium that\nwas named after France, from the latin word for France. Scandium that was named after,\nwell perhaps not a country but a region, Scandinavia, and then germanium, that was named after Germany. The first time that an element was discovered,\nwhen gallium was discovered, people said well it was just luck, but when scandium was discovered,\nthey really began to take Mendeleev pretty seriously, and by the time germanium was discovered\nthey really all decided that Mendeleev was right. Scandium, because it is an uncommon\nelement, is one where people don’t know much about the chemistry. I have never really\ndone any research in this area but like many elements suddenly there comes a time where\nthey become really quite popular and topical and now is the time for scandium and the reason\nis that scandium is a really light metal. Its density is slightly less than 4, that’s\n4 grams per cubic centimetre and that is very much lighter than most metals. Copper is nearly\n10 and lead and gold are close to 20, so this is really very light. So why should metals\nbe important if they are light, and that’s, the reason is sometimes you want to use a\nmetal, but you don’t want the object you make to be very heavy and so for example titanium\nwhich is very light, is used for making everything from golf clubs to jet fighter planes, where\nyou want it to be really light either so that you can swing it fast or fly fast. For scandium\nthe reasons are rather different, people are now thinking about using hydrogen, to power\ncars, to use hydrogen gas, to use hydrogen gas as the fuel to power cars, but what they\nwant to do is to store the hydrogen, in the equivalent of the petrol tank. You can’t\njust pressurise the hydrogen as in a gas cylinder because the container would be so heavy, that\nyour car would be like a military tank it would be so heavy. So what they want to try\nand do is produce a chemical compound, which is a bit like a sponge that will absorb the\nhydrogen and then for example if you warm it gently they hydrogen will come out, and\nit is here that you want the metal to be light because you want this material that you are\nusing to store hydrogen not to weigh very much. Because you have got to cart it around\nin your car all the time, and scandium compounds are now looking really quite promising, for\nstorage of hydrogen, and the idea is that rather like a molecular model kit, where you\nhave balls joined with sticks, you can use organic compounds, those of carbon and hydrogen\nwith a little oxygen, like sticks to join together scandium atoms, and produce a structure\nwhich has a lot of holes in it and then the hydrogen can go into those holes and be stored\nwithout needing an enormous pressure. Sounds like an incredibly complicated way\nto make a fuel tank. It is quite complicated but on the other hand,\nif it works, you don’t need to understand the chemistry. You just add the hydrogen to\nyour tank and away you go. How can you have got to your ripe old age\nas a chemist and never seen scandium? Well, chemists very often use compounds, salts\nof metals, but it’s not too often that you use the metal itself and salts because they\ndon’t have to be purified and so on quite as much as the metals are easier to get, they\nare not as expensive and so there are lots of the elements which I haven’t seen, but\nI am really quite pleased with this sample of scandium, so when I am finished I am going\nto frame it and hang it on my wall. So we have one of my students who works with\none of my colleagues, Martin Schroder and the student, has done his whole project, three\nyear project, on the chemistry of scandium, so when I got this letter I asked him: Have\nyou ever seen scandium? And he hadn’t, he had never seen the metal, so he was really\nquite excited to see John’s letter."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In his first periodic table (1869), Dmitri Mendeleev predicted the existence of the element scandium and two others.

So this is quality arsenic. So arsenic used to much more common in the\ncommunity than it is nowadays. It was used as a pigment in the nineteenth century for\ngreen wallpaper contained copper arsenite, because there weren’t any other good green\npigments to make the wallpaper. And when the rooms were damp, Victorians didn’t like\nopening the windows in their rooms, then mould would grow on the wall. And because arsenic\nis poisonous to most life forms the mould would convert the arsenic into a volatile\ncompound, trimethylarsine, and the trimethylarsine went into the air and several people were\nkilled by the arsenic coming from their wall paper. Now arsenic as we know is very toxic and there\nhave been a number of very high profile and very famous cases of people that have poisoned\nperhaps their partners or their business partners using arsenic. Okay, so I’m going to very\ncarefully take this vial out. He says very carefully then knocks it really hard. Arsenic was also used quite widely by people\nto dispose of husbands, wives, lovers.

So Zinc again is an abundant metal but it's a metal that we all need for life, it's part of enzymes and it's part of of many many biologically mediated processes. I don't know what else to say about Zinc it's a pretty boring metal.  It really is a boring metal. - Now I understand what my collegue said thinks bit boring. This isn't always the case and when you combine it with some other elements, it can get quite frisky, as you'll see in a bit. - Zinc is a really soft metal, it's sort of  greyish in colour, it reacts very easily with acids to produce hydrogen. In fact it's the way that people make hydrogen in the lab, or used to.  Now they usually buy it in cylinders. - Zinc is often found on things like roofs as well, very very high quality roofing material, very slow to oxidise. - Zinc is used very widely as a coating on iron. So called galvanizing. You put a thin layer of Zinc  and the Zinc then corrodes instead of the Iron, so that it stops the Iron rusting, at least for quite a long time. You can see it on corrugated iron roofs, metal gates in the countryside and so on. So this is Diethylzinc, so it's C4H10Zn.  - Zinc is quite important biologically, and there are all sorts of enzymes in our bodies that use Zinc. And particularly one called carbonic anhydrase that catalyse at the reaction of CO2 and water and so without Zinc, none of us could survive. The delivery of the statement that Zinc is boring were greatly under anticipating the result of this experiment. Really, you've built it up now. That's what we like to see. Have this one handy as well. Let's give this a go. - I told you to fix the stuff. So who says zinc's boring? Shall we do it again? Wow...No I don't think Zinc is in the least bit boring. I don't think that most elements are interesting, but Zinc is interesting because it's in the same group as Cadmium and Mercury and Cadmium and Mercury are both pretty poisonous. But Zinc is  essential to life. If you don't have enough Zinc you can't smell things. There are all sorts of enzymes in your body and those of other creatures, that won't work without Zinc. So it's really good.
