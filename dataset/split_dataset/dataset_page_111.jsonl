As the eel snags the mollusk\nin its long teeth, its prey struggles to escape. But before it can wriggle away, a second set of teeth lunge\nfrom the eel's throat, making short work of the captive\ncuttlefish. This adaptation is called\na pharyngeal jaw. And while it might seem more fitting\nfor an alien parasite than a fish, it's actually one of the most common\nadaptations under the sea. At some point millions of years ago, early fish evolved a jointed oral jaw\nfrom one of the bony arches that supported their frontal gills. This exterior, oral jaw was perfect\nfor capturing or chewing prey, but these early fish had a problem. They had no limbs to manipulate food\nwhile eating, making it easy for their mobile prey\nto escape before they took the first bite. Essentially, it was impossible for fish\nto capture and chew their prey at the same time with just one set\nof jaws. So to hold their food and eat it too, an even deeper gill arch evolved\ninto a secondary set of jaws. Unlike oral jaws connected\nby a bone joint, these pharyngeal jaws were suspended\nin muscle, offering them a wide range of motion\nto turn, tug, and tear on food. Some pharyngeal jaws actively chew, while others retract to pull chunks\nof food down the throat. Of course, the teeth a jaw has\nalso factor in here. For example, an oral jaw with fangs\nis exceptional for catching and holding on to fast-moving prey. But depending on what that prey is, a fish might want sharp pharyngeal teeth\nto tear through tissue, flat pharyngeal molars to grind\nplant matter, or a powerful pharyngeal bite\nto crush shelled prey. Fortunately some fishes can change\ntheir secondary teeth to match a new diet over several years. This flexibility allows fish to adapt and find food in a huge variety\nof aquatic environments. Some pharyngeal jaws have formed\nto eat food too hard for most fishes. California Sheephead use pointed teeth\nfrom their oral jaws to pry urchins off rocks before crushing\ntheir spiny exteriors in strong pharyngeal jaws that have fused\nwith the bones of their skulls. Other fish prioritize eating\nhuge quantities of food. The pharyngeal jaws of grass carp\nhave two bone components that move in unison to pull plant life\ninto their stomachs, consuming over 18 kilograms\nof seaweed a day. Other pharyngeal jaws are adapted\nto suit incredibly specific circumstances. Consider this species of pearlfish that\nlives inside sea cucumbers and feeds on their guts. Fish are the most diverse group\nof vertebrates with over 30,000 unique species, and much of that diversity is due\nto the hundreds of unique jaws separating otherwise identical species. Perhaps the best example of this\ndental diversity can be seen in cichlids. This family of fish is primarily found in\nselect African and South American lakes. Typically, large lakes like these\nwould be occupied by a handful of distantly related species, each adapted to consume one\nof the lake's limited food sources. But here, almost every corner\nof the ecosystem is occupied by a different species\nof cichlid. There are over 1,700 cichlid species, many almost identical save\nfor their uniquely adapted jaws which have evolved to eat crustaceans,\nmollusks, worms, algae, plankton, and even the scales of other fish. These oral adaptations are so essential\nfor survival, that different species use their\npharyngeal jaws to make unique mating sounds that allow female cichlids to identify\nmales of their own species. This technique limits\ninterspecies breeding, and ensures the parent fish will\npass on their specialized jaws. Scientists are still discovering\nall the ways this incredible skeletal mechanism\nfunctions. But given what we know already,\nit's fair to say that for most fish, two jaws are better than one."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where are the pharyngeal jaws located?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "At the tip of the mouth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In the gills"}, {"label": "C", "text": "On the tongue"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In the throat (pharynx)"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The pharyngeal jaws originated from what other feature of fish anatomy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The oral jaws"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The vertebrae"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The gill arches"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The rib cage"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Pharyngeal jaws used for grinding plant material have teeth of what shape?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flat and molar like"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Pointed and Fang like"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Serrated and knife like"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Thin and comb like"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How are some pharyngeal jaws strong enough to crush hard shelled prey?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The teeth are made of harder minerals which won’t break as easily"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The jaw bones are thicker and sturdier and can withstand strong biting force"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The jaw bones are fused to the skull instead of suspended in muscle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The jaw muscles are larger and made of stronger fibers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How have pharyngeal jaws contributed to speciation in cichlids?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cichlids only mate with fish that use their jaws on the same food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cichlids only mate with fish that use their jaws to make the right mating call"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cichlids only mate with fish that have pharyngeal jaws of an attractive shape"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cichlids only mate with fish that grow large due to the efficiency of pharyngeal jaws in feeding"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 111, "lesson": 2, "title": "Why the Tour de France is so brutal", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/T19YETwP", "transcript": {"en": "If you look closely at this pack of\nriders in the Tour de France, you'll see some of the best cyclists in the world.\nThey're here in the back. They're keeping up but also resting while their teammates in the front do most of the work. It's a technique called drafting\nand it's what helps them survive the three-week race around France. But\ndrafting only really makes a difference on these parts of the route: the long\nflat and hilly stages. Eventually these riders reach stages where they won't be\nable to rely on others. They have to rely on their own strength and endurance to\nwin the race. That happens here on the climbs. They're the most brutal and\nexciting parts of the race and they're what makes the Tour de France the most\nfamous bike ride in the world... The Tour de France began as a desperate\nploy to sell more copies of the sports newspaper, L'Auto. The paper was\nstruggling, so 1903 its editor, Henri Desgranges organized a 19 day, 2,400\nkilometer bike race around the country. It went on to become such a success that\nL'Auto made it an annual event. Year after year they added new routes to make the\ntour more challenging and also more interesting for people to follow. By 1908,\nL'Auto's sales had more than doubled. Then in 1910, one of Desgranges' writers,\nAlphonse Steines, suggested adding a new twist to the route: the Tourmalet. It was a\nbrutal 19 kilometer uphill climb ascending 1400 meters to the\nsummit. To see if this was even possible Steines jumped in his car to make the\nclimb. He drove up, but his car got stuck in the snow at the top,\nhe suffered from hypothermia and nearly died. But nonetheless he sent a telegram\nsaying: Tourmalet crossed. Very good road. perfectly passable. So the Tourmalet made its debut in the 1910 Tour. French cyclist Octave Lapize was the first to\nmake the climb successfully. But he had to walk up some parts and famously\ncalled officials assassins when he reached the summit. But he went on to win the whole tour and his statue was placed at the top of the Tourmalet. Since then,\nclimbs became a staple of the Tour de France. This year the route is made up of\n21 stages over 23 days. It features 30 major climbs; seven of them are in the\ntour's most difficult category. Including the Tourmalet, which is part of\nthe event for the 86th time. More than any other climb in the Tour's history.\nThese climbs are where the tour is ultimately won or lost. These are the\nlong, flat, and hilly stages that are usually about 200 kilometers long.\nHere cyclists ride together in a formation, called a peloton. It allows\ncyclists to save energy by sitting behind another rider or drafting. At high\nspeeds, riders use most of their energy to pedal against wind resistance. But\nwhen a rider stays close behind another, they're sheltered from much of that. So,\npedaling becomes much easier and they can keep up with the front riders. The\nway to measure this is to look at how much power a cyclist generates. Here at\nthe front of the peloton, a Tour de France rider will generate at least 300\nwatts of power. I jumped on a bike to see what that feels like and just two\nkilometers holding 300 watts was really really hard. By comparison when a rider\nis behind the lead in the peloton, they only need to generate about 240 watts to\nmove at the same speed. Holding 240 watts for two kilometers felt remarkably\neasier. So even though these two might finish a 200 kilometer flat stage at the\nsame time, one is going to be way less tired than the other. That's why you see\nsome of the tour's best riders here in the back. They're drafting up their\nteammates whose job it is to do the hard work now so that the team's best cyclist\nis rested for the most difficult part; the mountains. Where they'll have to be\non their own. When the peloton starts pedaling uphill,\nit slows down. At this stage the race is less about fighting wind resistance and\nmore about gravity, which affects all riders the same way in the peloton. So,\nnow every rider in the front and the back needs to generate an extraordinary\namount of power to keep up pace. In 2010 for instance, Danish cyclist Chris Anker\nSorensen made it to the front of the pack on the Tourmalet climb. \"Look at the\nface on Chris Anker Sorenesen. Dishing out the pain at the front end. As the lead, he\ndictated the pace of the whole group. This chart shows his power output on the\nfinal climb. He averaged 415 watts for more than 11 minutes. \"...face of Chris Anker Sorensen now, really dishing out the pain. And around here he peaked at an\nincredible 590 watts. \"magnificent riding by Chris Anker Sorenson, but how long can he keep this up? \"Now look at American cyclist Chris Horner. Even though he was several\npositions behind Sorenson, his power output was almost the same. The faster\nSorenson climbed, the harder it was for the rest of the peloton to keep up. And\nso the formation started to break up as weaker riders fell behind. This is the\nmoment in the race when the tour's best riders switch from drafting to relying\non their own strength to get ahead. Andy Schleck has finally attacked and Alberto Contador has gone with him. The race is breaking up behind them like two of the best riders here: Luxembourgian Andy Schleck and Spaniard Alberto Contador, who were coasting in the back of the peloton during the long flat\nstages. But here they are halfway up the Tourmalet, breaking away for the win. each likely generating well over 400 watts for the final eight kilometers. Contador\nin the yellow jersey, was the overall Tour de France leader but only by eight\nseconds. In second place was Schleck, who would try and lose him on this climb. \"Andy Schleck is riding like a man possessed\" It was neck-and-neck to the very top... It's Schleck on the right. Contador! Schleck wins! Contador takes second! Schleck edged Contador by a hair at the top of the Tourmalet to win the stage. But since he didn't lose him,\nContador kept his overall lead and went on to win the Tour de France. This kind\nof drama is only possible in the mountains and this year's route makes\nclimbs particularly important. This year's Tour is being called the highest in history because of how many climbs there are over the course of three weeks.\nJust one day features seven climbs. Even after more than two weeks in the race,\nriders climb to 2,770 meters above sea level where the thin air makes climbing even harder. That's what makes the Tour\nde France the most grueling and prestigious race in this sport. The\nwinner isn't simply the strongest rider but the one who endures the most pain\nand ultimately has what it takes to conquer the mountains."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How long is the modern race?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 weeks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3 weeks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "13 weeks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "6 weeks"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How did the Tour de France begin?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A challenge between friends"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To give the bicycling industry publicity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To sell a sports newspaper"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To promote tourism in France"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who was the first cyclist to complete the Tourmalet climb?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Octave Lapize"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lance Armstrong"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Alphonse Steines"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Henri Elodie"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

The hit song you performed \nat last night’s fair insulted the king, and now your hours are numbered. Just before your execution, you’re approached by the princess,\nwho happens to be a big fan. She slips you a pouch containing\ntwo magic, six-sided dice that can land any way you wish. You have no idea how this could possibly\nhelp, but you thank her anyways. As everything goes dark, you both suddenly find yourself standing \nin a deep cavern before a robed figure. It turns out that Death is a connoisseur\nof most excellent music. He’s decided to give you a chance \nto escape your fate by beating him at his favorite game: \nlife-sized Snakes and Ladders. The cavern has 100 rooms connected \nby passageways as well as— you guessed it—\nsnakes and ladders. Each turn one of you will roll a die, \nthen advance that many rooms. Ending your move at the bottom \nof a ladder means moving up to the top, while ending on a snake’s head\nwill make you slide down to its tail. Each of you must make your way\nthrough the cavern and reach the exit in fewer turns\nthan Death himself. Before you can think twice,\nyour host starts casting his die, and within 6 rolls he’s reached \nthe cavern entrance. “Better get moving,” he says. “Oh, and by the way, once one \nof you uses a snake or ladder, it’ll disappear and be inaccessible\nto the other.” You have no idea how you can possibly\nget lucky enough to win, but then you remember your magic dice. Can you figure out a sequence of rolls\nthat will get both of you to the exit in 5 or fewer moves each? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The cavern contains many\nroutes to the exit, and it’s natural to gravitate \nto the ladders that allow you to cover a lot of ground, \nquickly. Like this one— on turn 2 you’d be at 75, but without any further ladder boosts,\nyou’d need another 5 rolls to get out. Or this one— three ladders get you to 82, but then it would take another 4 rolls\nto get around the pesky snake at 88. In fact, there’s no path\nthat can get you to the exit in 5 moves using exclusively ladders. So where does that leave you? Snakes. It’s counterintuitive to make\nmoves that take you farther away from your target, but snakes open up a surprising amount \nof opportunities. For instance, these three ladders would\nput you a single roll from the exit, but cost too many turns\nto reach by ladders. These two are, however, only 5 and 12\nrooms from snake tails, respectively. So could you work backwards from those\nto find a 5 roll path? There are exactly two 5-turn routes\nyou might find using these ladders: Ladder snake snake ladder exit, and ladder ladder snake ladder exit. So that’s it, right? \nUnfortunately, no— the two paths share a snake and a ladder, each of which will be unusable after \nthe first of you slides and then climbs. You won’t find 5-turn\nmoves anywhere else, so is one of you doomed? There’s one more possibility to consider: the disappearing ladders and snakes\ncan impede your progress, but could they also help it? There are two paths to the 94 ladder\nthat almost work, except for this snake, at exactly the midpoint \nbetween the two ladders. If Bill were to take that snake \non his route, you could then get past it \nand up to the exit in just 5 moves. And good news— \nwhichever path you choose, one of the 5-roll paths we found\nearlier does exactly that without using any \nof your snakes or ladders. So all you need is for Bill to go first\nand stick to the plan. You and Bill both reach \nthe cavern entrance and climb back into the public square,\nto everyone’s surprise. Before the guards can seize you again, you wow the crowd— and king— with a song\nabout your epic contest with Death."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "With a magical die which can roll any number from 1 to 5, how many die rolls would a player need for the quickest way to the top?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "With a magical die which can roll any number from 1 to 7, how many die rolls would a player need for the quickest way to the top?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5"}, {"label": "C", "text": "6"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of these is the shortest snake on the board?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "47->30"}, {"label": "B", "text": "21->3"}, {"label": "C", "text": "81->62"}, {"label": "D", "text": "88->67"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of these changes will make the shortest path require 4 die rolls?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ladder 19-41 is replaced by a ladder 19-60"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Snake 31-8 is replaced by a ladder 8-31"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Snake 81-62 is replaced by snake 81-48"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only (b) & (c)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All (a), (b) & (c)"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the below statements are true about the rule of disappearing snakes and ladders once used?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Without this rule, BOTH of them would still be able to complete the game in 5 moves"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Without this rule, ONLY ONE of them would be able to complete the game in 5 moves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The second player could choose the ladder 53->94 because of this rule"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Only (b) & (c)"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Only (a) & (c)"}], "correct_option": "E"}]}

Unlike many other amphibians,\nwhich transform into terrestrial adults, axolotls retain their juvenile\ncharacteristics and never leave the water. In an attempt to induce metamorphosis, Duméril spent months removing their gills. But in most instances, the axolotls\nsimply... grew them back. Indeed, axolotls are masters\nof regeneration: they can flawlessly regenerate body parts ranging from amputated limbs and crushed \nspines to parts of their eyes and brains. So how do they do it? \nAnd what other secrets are they keeping? This extraordinary salamander is native\nto the wetlands in Mexico City. Ancient Aztec people considered it \nthe incarnation of a God named Xolotl— hence the axolotl’s name, \nroughly meaning “water monster.” Axolotls reach sexual maturity with gills \nand a tadpole-like dorsal fin. Scientists think their forever-young \ncondition, called “neoteny,” evolved because of their stable habitat. For salamanders that develop in waters\nthat dry up, efficiently transitioning to land \nis essential. But the lakes axolotls evolved \nin were unchanging year-round and didn't host many aquatic predators. So, scientists think it was advantageous\nfor axolotls to forgo the demands of metamorphosis. However,\nthey haven’t completely lost this ability. If exposed to certain substances,\naxolotls will turn into adults. But they’ll often experience\nshorter lifespans and lose some of their self-healing \nabilities. These regenerative talents may seem like\ncrazy superpowers to begin with, but axolotls have good use for them. As babies, they’re in direct competition. So, they snack on each other. This is usually not a huge problem \nthanks to how quickly they can regenerate body parts. When an axolotl loses a limb, tissues\nstimulate growth in the area. Skin cells divide and cover the wound. Then, progenitor cells, which can develop\ninto various bodily tissues, form a mass at the site of injury and nearby nerves secrete \ngrowth-promoting proteins. Over the next few weeks, \na new limb emerges as cells proliferate and differentiate \nin coordination. This process could potentially lead to\nuncontrolled growth and tumor formation. But axolotls are remarkably\nresistant to cancer. They have a system in place that tightly\ncontrols cellular proliferation. To better understand the axolotl’s \nbaffling biology, scientists sequenced its genome. They found it to be more than ten times\nlonger than a human’s. Mutations can change the length\nof any animal’s genome. For whatever reason, salamanders have\nmuch more DNA than other vertebrates because they lose parts\nof it less frequently. Investigating the axolotl’s genome,\nscientists saw many repeated sequences, most of which don't code for proteins\nand have no known function. They also found genes \nthat are key in regeneration. However, the biggest factor that sets\naxolotl regeneration apart may not be a set of unique genes, \nbut how they regulate their genes. It’s no wonder that axolotls are one\nof science’s most studied animals. But their population in the wild \nhas plummeted. Hundreds of years ago, axolotls thrived\nunder the Aztec capital. Within the surrounding lakes, Aztec people built islands called\nchinampas for growing crops. This highly productive form of agriculture\ncreated a vast system of canals, expanding the lake system’s \nshallow, sheltered habitat— the axolotls’ ideal environment. But when Spanish invaders arrived,\nthey began draining the lakes. And even more water has been\ndiverted in recent years. Today, the entire population of wild\naxolotls is found in just one place, Lake Xochimilco, where it’s threatened\nby pollution and invasive fishes. People are working to regenerate\nthe ecosystem and strengthen the 2,000 year old \nchinampa farming tradition. If interest grows, farmers could recover\nabandoned chinampas and support the local community—\nalong with the axolotl. Eventually, the benefits of saving \nthis salamander might be even greater. Scientists hope that one day\nwe’ll be able to apply the axolotl’s masterful tumor suppression\nand regenerative abilities to the human body.

What followed was one of the largest and\nbloodiest forced migrations in history. An estimated one million people \nlost their lives. Before British colonization, the Indian subcontinent was a patchwork \nof regional kingdoms known as princely states populated \nby Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis, and Jews. Each princely state had \nits own traditions, caste backgrounds, and leadership. Starting in the 1500s, a series \nof European powers colonized India with coastal trading settlements. By the mid-18th century, \nthe English East India Company emerged as the primary colonial power \nin India. The British ruled some provinces directly,\nand ruled the princely states indirectly. Under indirect rule, the princely states\nremained sovereign but made political and financial \nconcessions to the British. In the 19th century, the British began to \ncategorize Indians by religious identity— a gross simplification \nof the communities in India. They counted Hindus as “majorities” and all other religious communities \nas distinct “minorities,” with Muslims being the largest minority. Sikhs were considered part of the Hindu\ncommunity by everyone but themselves. In elections, people could only vote \nfor candidates of their own religious identification. These practices exaggerated differences, sowing distrust between communities\nthat had previously co-existed. The 20th century began with decades \nof anti-colonial movements, where Indians fought for independence\nfrom Britain. In the aftermath of World War II, under enormous financial strain \nfrom the war, Britain finally caved. Indian political leaders had \ndiffering views on what an independent India \nshould look like. Mohandas Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru\nrepresented the Hindu majority and wanted one united India. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, \nwho led the Muslim minority, thought the rifts created by colonization\nwere too deep to repair. Jinnah argued for a two nation division where Muslims would have a homeland \ncalled Pakistan. Following riots in 1946 and 1947,\nthe British expedited their retreat, planning Indian independence\nbehind closed doors. In June 1947, the British viceroy\nannounced that India would gain independence by August, and be partitioned\ninto Hindu India and Muslim Pakistan— but gave little explanation of how\nexactly this would happen. Using outdated maps, inaccurate census\nnumbers and minimal knowledge of the land, in a mere five weeks,\nthe Boundary Committee drew a border dividing three provinces \nunder direct British rule: Bengal, Punjab, and Assam. The border took into account where \nHindus and Muslims were majorities, but also factors like location\nand population percentages. So if a Hindu majority area bordered\nanother Hindu majority area, it would be included in India— but if a Hindu majority area bordered\nMuslim majority areas, it might become part of Pakistan. Princely states on the border had to\nchoose which of the new nations to join, losing their sovereignty in the process. While the Boundary Committee worked \non the new map, Hindus and Muslims began moving to areas where they thought they’d be a part \nof the religious majority— but they couldn’t be sure. Families divided themselves. Fearing sexual violence, parents sent \nyoung daughters and wives to regions they perceived to be safe. The new map wasn’t revealed \nuntil August 17th, 1947— two days after independence. The provinces of Punjab and Bengal became the geographically separated \nEast and West Pakistan. The rest became Hindu-majority India. In a period of two years, millions \nof Hindus and Sikhs living in Pakistan left for India, while Muslims living in India \nfled villages where their families had lived\nfor centuries. The cities of Lahore, Delhi, Calcutta, \nDhaka, and Karachi emptied of old residents \nand filled with refugees. In the power vacuum British forces\nleft behind, radicalized militias and local groups \nmassacred migrants. Much of the violence occurred in Punjab,\nand women bore the brunt of it, suffering rape and mutilation. Around 100,000 women were kidnapped \nand forced to marry their captors. The problems created by Partition went far\nbeyond this immediate deadly aftermath. Many families who made temporary moves \nbecame permanently displaced, and borders continue to be disputed. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded and became\nthe new country of Bangladesh.

Friends and neighbors exchanged \nnews and gossip while simultaneously attending\nto more... urgent business. These public latrines could sit\nup to 20 Romans at a time, draining waste in water conduits below. Today, most cultures consider trips to the\nrestroom to be a more private occasion. But even when going alone,\nour shared sewage infrastructure is one of the most pivotal inventions \nin the history of humanity. While many ancient religious texts \ncontain instructions for keeping waste away\nfrom drinking water and campsites, waste management took a more familiar\nshape as early as 3000 BCE. Ancient Mesopotamian settlements often had\nclay structures made for squatting or sitting \nin the most private room of the house. These were connected to pipes which used\nrunning water to move waste into street canals and cesspits. Water infrastructure like this flourished \nin the Bronze Age, and in some parts of the Indus Valley, nearly every house had a toilet connected\nto a citywide sewage system. Ancient Cretan palaces even offered\na manual flushing option. Researchers can’t say for certain \nwhat inspired these early sewage systems, but we do know that waste management\nis essential for public health. Untreated sewage is a breeding ground\nfor dangerous microorganisms, including those that cause cholera,\ndysentery, and typhoid. It would be several millennia before\nscientists fully understood the relationship between\nsewage and sickness. But the noxious odors of sewage have\nrecorded associations with disease as early as 100 BCE. And by 100 AD, more complex \nsanitation solutions were emerging. The Roman Empire had continuously \nflowing aqueducts dedicated to carrying waste \noutside city walls. Chinese dynasties of the same period \nalso had private and public toilets, except their waste \nwas immediately recycled. Most household toilets fed into pig sties, and specialized excrement collectors\ngathered waste from public latrines to sell as fertilizer. In China, this tradition of waste \nmanagement continued for centuries, but in Europe the fall of the Roman Empire brought public sanitation \ninto the Dark Ages. Pit latrines called “gongs” \nbecame commonplace, and chamber pots were frequently\ndumped into the street. Castles ejected waste from tall windows\ninto communal cesspits. At night, so-called gong farmers \nwould load up the waste before traveling beyond city limits \nto dump their cargo. Europe's unsanitary approach\npersisted for centuries, but toilets themselves underwent\nsome major changes. By the late Middle Ages, \nmost wealthy families had commode stools— wooden boxes with seats and lids. And in the royal court of England, the commodes were controlled\nby the Groom of the Stool. In addition to monitoring \nthe king’s intestinal health, the Groom’s... intimate relationship \nwith the monarch made him a surprisingly\ninfluential figure. The next major leap in toilet technology\ncame in 1596, when Sir John Harrington designed \nthe first modern flush toilet for Queen Elizabeth. Its use of levers to release water \nand a valve to drain the bowl still inform modern designs. But Harrington’s invention \nstank of sewage. Thankfully, in 1775, \nScottish inventor Alexander Cumming added a bend in the drainpipe \nto retain water and limit odors. This so-called S-trap was later improved\ninto the modern U-bend by Thomas Crapper— though the term “crap” predates \nthe inventor by several centuries. By the turn of the 19th century, many cities had developed \nmodern sewage infrastructure and wastewater treatment plants, and today, toilets have a wide range\nof features, from the luxurious to the sustainable. But roughly 2 billion people still don’t \nhave their own toilets at home. And another 2.2 billion \ndon’t have facilities that properly manage their waste, putting these communities \nat risk of numerous diseases. To solve this problem, we’ll need \nto invent new sanitation technologies and address the behavioral, financial, \nand political issues that produce inequity \nthroughout the sanitation pipeline."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The earliest evidence of use of sewer pipes and water to move human wastes was in Ancient Mesopotamia in the year _____?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1000 BC"}, {"label": "B", "text": "3000 BC"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100 A.D."}, {"label": "D", "text": " 4 BC"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In the Middle Ages in Europe (after the fall of the Roman Empire), the most common sanitation options for regular people were:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pit latrines"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ceramic bowls connected to sewer lines "}, {"label": "C", "text": "“Garderobe”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Commode stools"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The first “modern” flush toilet was invented for Queen Elizabeth by:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thomas Crapper"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Alexander Cumming"}, {"label": "C", "text": "  Cloaca Maxima "}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sir John Harrington"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The modification that reduced odors in a flush toilet was the", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Groom of the Stool"}, {"label": "B", "text": " S-bend in the pipe"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gong"}, {"label": "D", "text": " Chamber pot"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "About ___people don’t have toilets at home, or whose wastes are not properly treated.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 billion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2.2 billion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "4.2 billion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1 billion"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Half of her 17 siblings have already\nbeen eaten by the older generation, and it looks as though \nshe’s about to join them. But just as the predator closes in, she disappears into a thicket\nof underwater roots, safe in the refuge of the mangrove forest. Forests don’t usually come to mind\nas a habitat for sharks. But various marine forests cover roughly \n4.2 million square kilometers of the planet, providing food and shelter\nfor 35% of the world’s sharks. Deadly tiger sharks\nblend into seagrass meadows before pouncing on sea cows \nand sea turtles. White sharks hunt down seals in forests\nof kelp towering 65 meters tall. And lemon sharks stalk\nforests of mangroves— the only trees on Earth \nthat live in the ocean. All these ecosystems have their quirks, but mangroves may be the most unique \nof all. Harboring life between their roots\nand among their crowns, mangroves function as an essential bridge\nbetween land and sea. And to survive between these worlds,\ndifferent mangrove species have evolved various adaptations that \nprotect them and their resident sharks. Taking root in the unstable ground \nof muddy coastal regions is difficult, so mangrove seedlings germinate \nattached to their mother plant. Once they've grown large enough\nto survive on their own, these partially developed plants begin \nto ride the current. Most take root nearby, \nwhile some travel for several months before landing in a different part \nof the world. Once they’ve settled down,\nmangroves deploy tall, skinny stilt roots, crutch-like prop roots \nor wavy buttress roots, to support themselves \nin their unsteady terrain. These newly established mangroves have \nto contend with two additional problems: seawater is high in dehydrating\nand potentially toxic salt, and the mud contains little to no oxygen. This combination would be\nlethal to most trees, but mangroves make the most \nof their marshy surroundings. Rather than being completely buried, mangrove roots \nare largely above the ground. This allows the microscopic pores on these\nroots to take in oxygen during low tide before closing to create \na waterproof seal during high tide. Many mangroves also grow snorkel roots, which can take in oxygen \nthrough the same mechanism, or directly produce it via photosynthesis. To stop salt from entering their system, some mangrove species use \nincredibly fine filters in their roots. Others concentrate salt \ninside special cellular compartments, bark or dying leaves, that then drop off. Some species can even excrete \nthe excess minerals through specially adapted salt glands. All these processes make mangroves\nmore than a little salty, but that doesn’t deter coastal life \nfrom living in their nooks and crannies. While birds nest among mangrove branches, fish lay eggs amidst \ntheir sprawling, complex root systems. Symbiotic sponges and sea squirts \nprotect their host trees from hungry woodboring crustaceans. Crabs, snails, and shrimp \neat algae, mussels, barnacles, and salty mangrove detritus. These animals in turn feed fish, which are devoured by shark pups \nroaming the roots— alongside occasional\nvegetarian meals of seagrass. But sharks aren’t just the beneficiaries\nof marine forests, they’re part of the glue \nthat holds them together. Sharks limit the abundance of animals which would otherwise overgraze \nthese essential plants. Just as marine forests provide shelter \nto vulnerable baby predators, those predators grow up\nto protect their forest homes. Unfortunately, both sides of this delicate\nbalance are under threat. Overfishing has decimated \nshark populations worldwide, and many marine forests are being polluted\nor cut down for coastal development. This destruction\nis especially dangerous because marine forests are one \nof the single most important ecosystems in mitigating climate change. Mangroves and seagrasses trap\ncarbon between their roots, and fast-growing kelps export vast\namounts of carbon to the deep ocean. Together, marine forests sequester around\n310 million tonnes of carbon every year, capturing 3% of our annual\nglobal carbon emissions. So, like the sharks that inhabit them, humans need to fight tooth and nail \nto protect these essential ecosystems."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What shark species performs intraspecific predation (i.e. adult sharks eating juveniles of their own species)?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Puffadder shyshark"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bonnethead shark"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lemon shark"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pyjama shark"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Roughly how much of our planet is covered by marine forests?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "6.5 million square kilometres"}, {"label": "B", "text": "800 thousand square kilometres"}, {"label": "C", "text": "510.1 million square kilometres"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4.2 million square kilometres"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How many of the world’s shark species are found in marine forests?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "60%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "35%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "12%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8%"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are the major problems mangroves have to contend with during their life on the edge of the sea?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Unstable, muddy ground"}, {"label": "B", "text": "High salinity of seawater"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lack of oxygen in mud"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What are some of the root structures that mangroves have?

other things i really loved was writing stories this was my teacher hendrika kuperas she was so encouraging wonderful job and one other thing that's important to know about me is that i'm jewish that's my religion i believe in god and in helping to make the world a better place but when i was born in germany there were people knewing as nazi who didn't like those of us who were jewish or other groups who were different from them back then the nazis were run by a terrible leader named adolf hitler who promised to make germany strong again don't buy from jews they say germans unite why are they being so mean they don't even know us he believed that germans were superior and he blamed the jews for all of germany's problems even though we hadn't done anything wrong they protect us from the nazi my family became refugees and moved to a city called amsterdam in the netherlands life was good there for years until may the 10th 1940 when the german came to the netherlands too the nazi that tried to take over the world we need to leave here now it's not safe anymore we tried to leave the netherlands and go to the united states but we couldn't you need to fill out more forms if you want to be an immigrant but my family if we stay here i'm sorry more forms please when the germans arrived in the netherlands they passed new laws here at first jews weren't allowed in public parks beaches pools or in libraries we can't go swimming jews are not wanted here then they said we couldn't go to the movies but i love the movies we don't serve juice here eventually we weren't allowed to ride our own bikes drive our own cars or buy food or certain restaurants i just want to feed my family no jews allowed one of the worst days was when they said we have to leave our school and only be with all the jewish kids i'm sorry teacher says those are the new rules no jews allowed i'll miss you and i'll miss all of you every day it seemed to get worse in april 1942 the nazis made us wear these jewish stars with the dutch word for jew why do we have to wear these whenever we go out so they can always identify us if we got caught outside without our star we'd get in trouble i know it sounds scary but this isn't a story about fear it's a story about hope even when bad things happen there are good things all around on friday june 12th i woke up really early it was my birthday every year my parents put all my presents out on the table and this year i couldn't wait for one particular gift a diary it had its own little lock i love it i started writing immediately dear kitty kitty was the name i gave to my diary i wanted the diary to be my friend a few weeks later we got terrible news what is it dear margo our daughter they sent her a call up notice we knew what a call up really meant the nazis would send people to a concentration camp a prison where jews were locked up and made to work all day and night there was almost nothing to eat or drink if you went there escape was nearly impossible my parents were running out of options if we stayed the nazis would come for my sister if we tried to leave they'd hunt us down there's only one choice we need to hide my parents told us to stop packing we couldn't only take our most important things the first thing i grabbed was this diary a book yes a place to hold my daily thoughts we wore layers of clothes so no one would see us carrying suitcases the hardest part was saying goodbye to my cat the neighbors will take good care of her i promise my father said i love you mosh day as we snuck out there were four of us and another family of three met us there this was our hiding spot a small area at the back of my father's office the secret annex the bookcase covered the entryway and could swing shut so no one would find us and here's what she wrote our hiding place has now become a true hiding place our new home was about the size of one bedroom apartment for seven of us this was my parents living room and bedroom how are we all going to fit see the attic up top the bookcase entrance and this was for me and my sister abscess was another room it was a bedroom kitchen and living room all in one for the van pelt the other jewish family hiding with us plus there was a place for the issue since there were still people working in dad's old office we'd spend our days up here on the higher floor so no one would hear us it wasn't an easy place to live there's no hot water i know make the best of it but what do you mean we can't flush the toilet during the day if you do people will hear the noise and we'll be arrested and for dinner beans again shhh the workers downstairs will hear us beans again and beans tomorrow during weekdays we had to whisper we could never talk in abnormal voice all the windows were covered and since shoes were noisy on the wood plus we usually were sucks to be extra quiet one wrong move and the nazis might find us it would have been easy to complain but i decided to look at the bright side and she wrote it may be damp and lopsided but there's probably not a more comfortable hiding place in all of amsterdam no in all of holland to make it feel more normal i decorated my walls with pictures of movie stars my dad surprised me by bringing along my collection of magazines to make everyone laugh peanut i would dress up he wore his mom's dress and i wore his suit there was one big bright spot though the non-jewish helpers who risked their own lives to protect us this is meep guys she'd bring us groceries and tell us what was happening in the world here's more food and i got you a little present this is johannes kleinman who brought me my favorite books including fairy tales and ones about real historical heroes and that's johan vasquez who built the bookcase that hit us and you'll see john geese b foska jewel and victor coogler the nazis threatened to punish anyone who helped the jewish people but these amazing people decided it was more important to do the right thing and help us they weren't the only ones this is my dentist fritz pfeiffer i know there are seven of you but he needs a place to hide too he can stay we'll make room our hiding spot was time but when someone needs help you can turn away we hid in the secret annex for two years and one month i went to school here i wanted to be a famous writer to make an impact on people's lives we took our school books with us and the helpers would bring more we studied every day until 12 30. after that we peeled potatoes on weekends we could listen to the radio with eight of us clean together our world was very small but if you look for what's good you'll find it this was the attic my favorite spot it had the one window that wasn't covered where i could see the blue sky and this one chestnut tree i grew up here i saw the world from here and eventually the world saw me and here's what she wrote who knows maybe our religion will teach the world and all the people in it about goodness as long as this exists this sunshine and this cloudless sky and as long as i can enjoy it how sad can i be as long as you can look fearlessly at the sky you'll know that you're pure within and will find happiness once more and of course she wrote i still believe in spite of everything that people are truly good at heart in my life there were many reasons to be sad and lonely and scared but there were also many reasons to love and laugh and hope you can always find light in the darkest places that's what hope is it's a fire within you you decide when to light it and when it burns bright nothing can put it out hitler and the nazis were defeated at the end of world war ii six million jews including anne frank were killed in what is now known as the holocaust by remembering and telling anne's story we make sure that nothing like this ever happens again whatever our religion wherever we're from we have a responsibility to one another today anne frank's diary is one of the most read most inspiring books in the world more than one million people visit the anne frank house in amsterdam each year in 2010 anne's chestnut tree was blown down in a storm but today and here's what i love there were locations all over the world where its saplings were planted and new chestnut trees bloom stronger than ever and the jewish faith is the same if a person saves one life it's as if they've saved an entire world throughout your life you'll find people who need help be a helper be the one who does the right thing when you see something that's

Like all Greeks, she's known the legend\nof Delphi since childhood. Two eagles released by Zeus \nfrom opposite ends of the Earth met on the slopes of Mount Parnassus, identifying Delphi \nas the center of the world. Marking this spot was a mysterious stone\nguarded by a legendary serpent called the pytho. But when Apollo killed the pytho,\nhe made Delphi his home— establishing the city\nas the best place in the world to seek guidance directly\nfrom the God of Prophecy. Well, almost directly. At any given time, a single oracle known \nas the Pythia communicates Apollo’s will. Reserved only for women, this is \nthe most important job in the city— and one that Aristonike will soon have to \ntake on as the current Pythia-in-training. Despite serving in the Temple of Apollo \nfor many years, Aristonike is still uncertain that she’s\nwise enough to fulfill this role. But these doubts will have to wait. Today she’ll be shadowed by officials \nfrom the city’s governing council. If her performance meets their standards, this is the day she’ll become \nthe new Oracle of Delphi. In the heart of the temenos, \nor sacred enclosure, Aristonike greets the current Oracle\nand the city officials. The group joins the procession\nto the Castilian Spring, where the Pythia performs \na purification ceremony to prepare for a day of prophecy. To establish whether\nApollo is willing to be consulted, Aristonike brings water from the spring \nto the temple priests, who sprinkle it on a goat. If the goat shudders, \nit will be a prophecy day. If not, travelers from as far away as \nmodern day Sicily, Egypt, and Afghanistan will have to wait an entire month \nto consult the Oracle again. Fortunately, Apollo\nis in a communicative mood. Delphians are first in line, most seeking\nadvice about business or marriage. Following the locals are other Greeks \nand then non-Greeks, including ambassadors from great\ncities who plan to ask about whether to go to war, \nor where they should found new colonies. Most supplicants bring two options\nfor the Pythia to choose between, alongside the obligatory sacrificial cake. Aristonike reports back to the Pythia, pointing out important figures \nand sharing some of their concerns— all while the city counselor takes\nnotes on her performance. Then the Pythia disappears into her \noracular chamber known as the adyton. Inside, she’ll channel the inspiration \nof Apollo, uttering ambiguous prophecies\nthe questioners must interpret. The adyton is the one place in the temple \nAristonike isn’t allowed to go. So while consultations continue, the Oracle-in-training sets off to collect\nwood for the temple’s eternal flame. While gathering branches \nfrom the sacred laurel trees, Aristonike spies wealthy Greeks \ntraining for the upcoming Pythian Games. Second in importance only to the Olympics, these games bring great riches\nand attention to Delphi. Typically, Aristonike would pause\nto admire the athletes, but today she’s more focused\non impressing her observer. Taking the exact amount\nof branches necessary, she hurries back to the temple \nfor her long awaited evaluation. The counselor who shadowed her \nshares his notes with the other officials, and after a brief discussion,\ntheir leader nods. He endorses Aristonike as the new Oracle— and the Pythia offers Apollo’s blessing \non their verdict. Approaching Aristonike \nbeside the sacred hearth, the Pythia finally unveils \nthe secrets of her trade. Passed directly from one Oracle \nto the next, no history book will ever\nrecord these details. But the Pythia’s insights will guide \nall of Aristonike’s future prophecies— shaping wars, politics, and relationships\nfor years to come, and making Aristonike one of the most\npowerful women in the ancient world.

At that time, everybody had a job, but everyone was struggling. In the early '80s,\nmy dad was an electrician, and my mom worked two shifts\nin the local hospital. But still, we didn't have enough food, and our living conditions were dismal. We were undoubtedly equal -- we were equally poor. The state owned everything. We owned nothing. The story I'm going to share with you\nis about my struggles of overcoming adversity with my resilience, grit\nand sheer determination. No, I'm just kidding,\nI'm not going to do that to you. (Laughter) Instead, I'm going to tell you, what I'm going to talk about today\nis about a new form of collective poverty that many of us don't recognize and that urgently needs to be understood. I'm sure you've noticed\nthat in the past 20 years, that asset has emerged. It's been generating wealth\nat a breakneck pace. As a tool, it has brought businesses\ndeep customer insights, operational efficiency and enormous top-line growth. But for some, it has also provided a device\nto manipulate a democratic election or perform surveillance\nfor profit or political purposes. What is this miracle asset? You've guessed it: it's data. Seven out of the top 10 most valuable\ncompanies in the world are tech companies that either directly generate\nprofit from data or are empowered by data from the core. Multiple surveys show that the vast majority\nof business decision makers regard data as an essential\nasset for success. We have all experienced how data\nis shifting this major paradigm shift for our personal, economic\nand political lives. Whoever owns the data owns the future. But who's producing the data? I assume everyone in this room\nhas a smartphone, several social media accounts and has done a Google search\nor two in the past week. We are all producing data. Yes. It is estimated that by 2030,\n10 years from now, there will be about 125 billion\nconnected devices in the world. That's an average of about\n15 devices per person. We are already producing data every day. We'll be producing exponentially more. Google, Facebook and Tencent's\ncombined revenue in 2018 was 236 billion US dollars. Now, how many of you\nhave received payment from them for the data you generate for them? None, right? Data has immense value\nbut is centrally controlled and owned. You are all walking raw materials\nfor those large data companies, but none of you are paid. Not only that, you're not even considered\nas part of this equation for income. So once again, we are undoubtedly equal: we're equally poor. Somebody else owns everything,\nand we own nothing. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? So what should we do? There might be some clues\nin how my life turned out after that difficult start. Things began to look up\nfor my family in the '80s. The system evolved, and people began to be allowed\nto own a piece of what we created. \"People diving into the ocean,\" or \"xia hai,\" the Chinese term, described those who left\nstate-owned enterprise jobs and started their own businesses. Private ownership of a business became personal ownership of cars, properties, food, clothes and things. The economic machine started rolling, and people's lives began to improve. For the first time, to get rich was glorious. So in the '90s, when I went\nto study in Chengdu in west China, many young individuals like myself were well-positioned\nto take advantage of the new system. After I graduated from my university, I cofounded my first business\nand moved to Shenzhen, the brand-new special economic zone\nthat used to be a fishing village. Twenty years later, Shenzhen has become\na global innovation powerhouse. Private ownership was a form of liberty\nwe didn't have before. It created unprecedented opportunities\nfor our generations, motivating us to work\nand study incredibly hard. The result was that more than\n850 million people rose out of poverty. According to the World Bank, China's extreme poverty rate in 1981,\nwhen I was a little kid, was 88 percent. By 2015, 0.7 percent. I am a product of that success, and I am very happy to share that today,\nI have my own AI business, and I lead a very worldly\nand dynamic life, a path that was unimaginable\nwhen I was a kid in west China. Of course, this prosperity\ncame with a trade-off, with equality,\nthe environment and freedom. And obviously I'm not here to argue\nthat China has it all figured out. We haven't. Nor that data is fully comparable\nto physical assets. It is not. But my life experience allowed me\nto see what's hiding in plain sight. Currently, the public discourse is so focused on the regulatory\nand privacy issue when it comes to data ownership. But I want to ask: What if we look at data ownership\nin completely different ways? What if data ownership is, in fact, a personal, individual and economic issue? What if, in the new digital economy, we are allowed to own\na piece of what we create and give people the liberty\nof private data ownership? The legal concept of ownership\nis when you can possess, use, gift, pass on, destroy or trade it or sell your asset at a price accepted by you. What if we give that same definition\nto individuals' data, so individuals can use or destroy our data or we trade it at our chosen price? Now, I know some of you might say, \"I would never, ever trade my data\nfor any amount of money.\" But that, let me remind you,\nis exactly what you're doing now, except you're giving\nyour data away for free. Plus, privacy is a very personal\nand nuanced issue. You might have the privilege\nto prioritize your privacy over money, but for millions of small\nbusiness owners in China who can't get bank loans easily, using their data to gain rapid loan\napproval from AI-powered lenders can answer their more pressing needs. What's private to you is different from\nwhat's private to others. What's private to you now is different from what was private\nwhen you were in college. Or, at least, I hope so. (Laughter) We are always,\nalthough often subconsciously, making such trade-offs based on our diverse personal beliefs\nand life priorities. That is why data ownership\nwould be incomplete without a pricing power. By assigning pricing power to individuals, we gain a tool to reflect\nour personal and nuanced preferences. So, for example, you could choose\nto donate your data for free if a contribution\nto a particular medical research is very meaningful for you. Or, if we had the tools\nto set our behavior data at a price of, say,\n100,000 US dollars, I doubt any political group\nwould be able to target or manipulate your vote. You control. You decide. Now, I know this sounds\nprobably implausible, but trends are already pointing to a growing and very powerful\nindividual data ownership movement. First, start-ups\nare already creating tools to allow us to take back some control. A new browser called Brave empowers users with \"Brave Shields\" --\nthey literally call it that -- by aggressively blocking\ndata-grabbing ads and trackers, and avoid leaking data\nlike other browsers. In return, users can take back\nsome bargaining and pricing power. When users opt in to accept ads, Brave rewards users\nwith \"basic attention tokens\" that can redeem content\nbehind paywalls from publishers. And I've been using Brave\nfor a few months. It has already blocked\nmore than 200,000 ads and trackers and saved hours of my time. Now, I know some of you\ninteract with your browser more than with your partners, so -- (Laughter) you should at least find one that doesn't\nwaste your time and is not creepy. (Laughter) Do you think Google is indispensable? Think again. A search engine is indispensable. Google just has the monopoly -- for now. A search engine called DuckDuckGo\ndoesn't store your personal information or follow you around with ads or track your personal browsing history. Instead, it gives all users\nthe same search results instead of based on\nyour personal browsing records. In London, a company called digi.me offers an app you can download\non your smartphone that helps to import and consolidate\nyour data generated by you from your Fitbit, Spotify, social media accounts ... And you can choose\nwhere to store your data, and digi.me will help you\nto make your data work for you by providing insights that used\nto be exclusively accessible by large data companies. In DC, a new initiative\ncalled UBDI, U-B-D-I, Universal Basic Data Income, helps people to make money by sharing anonymous insights\nthrough their data for companies that can use them\nfor market research. And whenever a company purchases a study, users get paid in cash and UBDI points\nto track their contribution, potentially as much\nas 1,000 US dollars per year per their estimation. UBDI could be a very feasible path\nfor universal basic income in the AI economy. Further, individual awareness\nof privacy and data ownership is growing fast as we all become aware of this monster\nwe have unleashed in our pocket. I'm a mother of two preteen girls, and trust me, the single biggest source of stress\nand anxiety as a parent, for me, is my children's\nrelationship with technology. This is a three-page agreement\nmy husband and I make them sign before they receive\ntheir first [mobile phone]. (Laughter) We want to help them to become digital citizens, but only if we can make them\nbecome smart and responsible ones. I help them to understand\nwhat kind of data should never be shared. So if you Google me, in fact -- actually, sorry --\nif you DuckDuckGo me, you will find maybe a lot\nabout me and my work, but you may find no information\nabout my daughters. When they grow up, if they want to put themselves out there,\nit's their choice, not mine, despite that I insist\nthey're the most beautiful, smartest and most extraordinary\nkids in the world, of course. And I know many people\nare having similar conversations and making similar decisions, which gives me hope that a truly smart data-rich future\nwill be here soon. But I want to highlight\nthe Clause 6 of this agreement. It says, \"I will never, ever search\nfor any information online if I would be embarrassed\nif seen by Grandma Dawnie.\" (Laughter) Try it. It's really effective. (Laughter) Throughout history, there has always been a trade-off\nbetween liberty and equality in the pursuit of prosperity. The world has constantly been going\nthrough the circle of wealth accumulation to wealth redistribution. As the tension between\nthe haves and have-nots is breaking so many countries, it is in everyone's interest, including the large data companies, to prevent this new form of inequality. Of course, individual data ownership\nis not the perfect nor the complete answer to this profoundly complex question of what makes a good digital society. But according to McKinsey, AI will add 13 trillion US dollars\nof economic output in the next 10 years. Data generated by individuals\nwill no doubt contribute to this enormous growth. Shouldn't we at least consider\nan economic model that empowers the people? And if private ownership helped\nto lift more than 850 million people out of poverty, it is our duty and we owe it to future generations to create a more inclusive AI economy that will empower the people\nin addition to businesses. Thank you.

Jablonski", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-we-have-hair-in-such-random-places-nina-g-jablonski", "transcript": {"en": "We have lots in common with our closest\nprimate relatives. But comparatively, humans seem a bit... \nunderdressed. Instead of thick fur covering our bodies, many of us mainly have hair \non top of our heads— and a few other places. So, how did we get so naked? \nAnd why do we have hair where we do? Human hair and animal fur \nare made of the same stuff: filaments of the protein keratin that grow\nout of organs known as follicles, which go through cycles \nof growth and shedding. Across mammalian species, hairs have been \nmodified for numerous purposes, ranging from the soft fluff \ncovering rabbits to the rigid quills protecting porcupines. But for many mammals, \nhair grows in two layers consisting of a shorter undercoat \nof ground hairs covered by longer guard hairs. Together, they help insulate \nthe animal’s body and protect its skin. Human hairs, on the other hand, are \nkind of a combination of these hair types. Unfortunately, \nhair is rarely found in fossils, making it hard for researchers\nto pinpoint when and how our ancient ancestors lost their coats. But scientists have developed\nsome working hypotheses. It seems that, \nmillions of years ago in Africa, early hominins first transitioned out of\ntrees and adopted a more active lifestyle. Keeping cool became \nincreasingly important. Eventually, they developed\nmore sweat glands, which helped them lose heat by evaporating\nmoisture through the skin. In fact, humans have 10 times more sweat\nglands than chimpanzees, for instance. But efficiently losing heat by sweating is\nharder to do when you’re covered in fur. Scientists believe that early humans\nlost much of their coat around this time to help their sweat evaporate faster. However, if losing our hair\nwas so advantageous, why do we have any left at all? It seems that there are unique uses \nfor hair in different parts of our bodies. When it comes to the tops of our heads, temperature regulation \nlikely played a part again. Since early humans\nbegan venturing into the open, their heads would’ve been exposed\nto the scorching sun. Thicker, longer-growing hair protects\nour sensitive scalps and keeps our brains from overheating. Dark tightly curled hair is most effective\nat keeping solar radiation off of skin. Other kinds of head hair evolved\nas humans moved to different places. Meanwhile, researchers think eyebrows \nare especially useful for communication because they sit atop active facial\nmuscles that convey our feelings. Eyelashes have been shown to minimize\nairflow over our eyeballs, preventing them from drying\nout and catching debris. And maybe facial hair proved helpful in\ndistinguishing identity from a distance, but we really don’t know. Evidence is stubbly at best. Why we have hair in other regions is...\nmore pungent. Our armpits, nipples, and pubic areas\nare dotted with apocrine glands. They produce oily, smelly secretions\nwhich the thick, curly hair that often grows in these spots \nhelps disperse. The secretions that waft off these hairy\npatches may be useful for identification. For example, several studies have shown\nthat people are able to identify their own armpit odors as well as those\nof people they’re close with. The final type of notable human hair is\nthe vellus hair that covers our bodies. We don't know if these hairs serve\nany purpose themselves, but the follicles vellus hair grows from\nare essential banks of stem cells that repair damaged skin after injury. They’re also important sites \nof nerve endings that convey signals of gentle touch to the brain. In fact, although it’s much finer, humans have roughly the same density \nof body hair as apes of comparable sizes.

Shasha", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-the-trojan-war-riddle-dennis-e-shasha", "transcript": {"en": "The Trojan War has been raging \nfor 10 years, with neither Greeks nor Trojans \nprevailing. Gods and humans alike\nare desperate for a break, so when a divine omen races\nacross the sky, the two sides agree to a 10 day truce. From high up on Olympus you’ve been \nwaiting for an opportunity to bring this bloody war \nto its conclusion. When you go to consult the Fates,\nthey advise: should the peace last for a full 10 days,\nall will end soon. However, if the truce is broken, the ensuing battle will lead to 10 more\ndevastating years of war. The Fates’ loom has shown them \nthe exact conditions that will keep the truce intact. The great Trojan plain can be viewed \nas a grid of Greek and Trojan encampments. If they’re organized in such a way that \nany Greek can reach any other Greek camp without having to pass through a Trojan \ncamp, and likewise for Trojans, plus neither side completely surrounds \nthe other, peace will prevail. Anyone can move to a horizontally\nor vertically adjacent camp, but never diagonally. The problem is,\nthey’re currently arranged like this. Tonight, you can use your powers to swap\nup to six pairs of camps that are horizontally, vertically,\nor diagonally adjacent. No camp can be moved more than once. Which swaps do you make\nto keep the peace? Pause here to figure it out yourself.\nAnswer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 The first insight here is to divide\nthis into two sub-problems. There’s the matter of connecting \n4 clumps of Greeks without putting holes in the Trojan line. And then there’s dealing \nwith the thorny center space. Let’s consider the Greeks first. To connect any Greek clumps, you’ll have to mess \nwith the nice, straight Trojan lines. If you try to do that anywhere\nin the center of these arms, you'll create new isolated\nclusters of Trojans. So the only option is to go \nto the perimeter of the field and move some Trojans diagonally,\nsay here, here, and here. Now for the center. there’s no way to connect the Trojan arms \nwithout swapping a Trojan in. But continuing to shift that arm \nof Trojans inward would require moving \nthe same Greek camp multiple times. However, you could shift the whole\nTrojan arm up and to the right, closing this gap. There are several\nsolutions with slight variants, but as long as you perform this maneuver\non the short arm of Trojans, you can achieve peace in exactly 6 moves. You make the swaps and all is well \nuntil the fifth night. One of your rival gods wants\nto see the bloodshed continue, and has taken advantage \nof a forgotten prophecy. He’s convinced one Trojan camp \nto make a swap with their horizontal, vertical, \nor diagonal Greek neighbors that will break up the Greek connectivity. Once again, you consult the Fates,\nwho prophesize the following: the meddling Trojan camp is somewhere\nwithin four grid spaces of the perimeter of the battlefield. They won’t go through with a swap \nif it only breaks up Trojan connectivity. And finally, you can make \nat most two swaps with the same rules as before \nto thwart them. Which swaps do you make \nto block the troublesome Trojan camp? Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You won't be able to identify\nthe scheming camp precisely, but there’s a lot you can do \nto at least narrow down the options. They have to be somewhere in this area. And they have to be able to block Greek\ncamps from each other in a single swap. That doesn’t leave many options; the only possible blockages \nare at the end of these two arms, where a Trojan camp could plug a hole\nwithout opening a new one. So they must be in one of these \nfour camps. Let’s look at the right arm first. There’s a threat here because this column \nhas two Trojan camps. If one moves to the right, \nthe other will still be in place, blocking Greeks from crossing. so we can thwart them by moving either one\na column left into this square. and the same principle applies \nto the bottom arm.

You are now entering... the Twilight Zone. Your mission is to survive these depths and journey to the surface \nafter sundown to feed. You may now pick your player. Just kidding— you don’t have a choice. You’re a hatchetfish. And almost everything else \nis trying to eat you. The tools at your disposal \nare a uniquely shaped body, shiny scales, and glowing spots\non your belly. You’re going to need a lot of skill \nand a little luck. Your first challenge is to begin \nyour upwards trek. Your swim bladder allows you \nto precisely control your buoyancy. Come nightfall, you slowly fill it up, becoming less dense and rising\ntowards the surface. You can’t swim fast, but your narrow build\nmakes you maneuverable. This is especially important since\npredators could spring out of the darkness at any moment. In fact, a fangtooth \nis gliding beneath you. It has the ocean’s biggest\ntooth-to-body size ratio. Food is hard to come \nby in the Twilight Zone, so predators have fearsome adaptations\nto make every attack count. The fangtooth’s skin is ultra-black: it reflects less than 0.5% of the light \nthat hits it, making this fish particularly\nhard to spot. Fortunately, the bioluminescent organs\nlining your belly are regulated to match the intensity and pattern of the \nfaint light from the ocean’s surface. This counter-illumination disguises\nyour silhouette. So when the fangtooth gazes upwards,\nyou’re almost invisible. A bright spot appears in the distance. You go to check it out, \nbut something’s looming in the darkness. The light is a bioluminescent lure\nbelonging to an anglerfish. You dart away before it quickly\nopens its jaws, sucking in a hapless fish \nthat got too close. Another narrow escape, \nbut you’re nearly there. Although more than 90% \nof deep-sea creatures are bioluminescent, only one group produces the color red: \ndragonfishes. One of them is near. Because red light is quickly absorbed \nby seawater, most deep-sea inhabitants can’t see it. The dragonfish emits red light\nfrom organs by its eyes, using an invisible headlight to locate\nunsuspecting prey that its scoops \ninto its cavernous jaw. You can’t see your enemy, but your silvery, mirror-like scales\nscatter and soften direct light, keeping you hidden. After three close calls, \nyou reach... the Photic Zone. You’ve just participated \nin the world’s largest migration. It takes place every night as trillions\nof organisms rise from the ocean’s depths to enjoy the surface’s rich resources \nunder the cover of darkness. The payoff is huge. Here, your light-sensitive eyes take\nin a buffet of small crustaceans and gelatinous zooplankton. During the day, phytoplankton use sunlight\nto turn dissolved carbon dioxide into energy and build their own cells. They become food for small grazers,\nforming the base of the food web, which extends back down \nto the Twilight Zone— and beyond. Organic matter generated up here—\nlike bits of skin, poop, and dead animals— eventually sinks or is transported \nin the stomachs of animals returning from their nightly migrations. These materials then feed the creatures\nbelow that don't migrate. This ensures that some of the carbon \nfrom the atmosphere is locked away in the ocean \nfor hundreds of years to come. That's why this process is known\nas the biological carbon pump. Without it, there’d be much\nmore carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, where it contributes to climate change.

"https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-rumors-about-vaccines-spread-and-how-to-rebuild-trust-heidi-larson", "transcript": {"en": "[Music] I study rumors not tabloid gossip for the kind of rumors that are making stock markets crash or soar but the kind of rumors that affect your health and the world's health like eating a lot of garlic or drinking a lot of water is going to help protect us from coronavirus if only rumors have a bad reputation they're seen as not fact wrong or just a rumor but I've studied rumors for years and one thing I've learned is that they all have a story and often an important story one of the most moving or alarming rumor episodes that I investigated was in northern Nigeria I was working with UNICEF's global immunization program and it wasn't the rumors themselves that I found so alarming it was the global impact of those rumors the rumors were suspecting that the polio vaccine was actually a contraceptive it was controlling populations or maybe it caused AIDS no no maybe it's the CIA spying on them or counting them I mean why else would they have people knocking on their door again and again with the same polio vaccine when children are dying of measles no one was coming with measles vaccines this wasn't about getting the facts right this was about trust was about broken trust why so much distrust it wasn't the mothers who were particularly distrusting actually it was the local leaders the religious leaders the local political leaders it was the governor of the state of Cano who decided to boycott the entire polio eradication effort in that eight for 11 months why such distrust well it was 2003 it was two years after 9/11 and they were convinced that the West and particularly the United States was at war with Muslims and they knew that the West and particularly the United States was a huge supporter and funder of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative they had their reasoning that lack of trust that just a rumor or to cost the polio eradication program 500 million dollars to reset the clock to regain the progress lost during those 11 months and beyond it the Nigerian strain of the polio virus traveled to over 20 countries as far as Indonesia the cost of a rumor the Nigeria episode was one of many episodes that I investigated when I was with UNICEF and earned the title of the director of UNICEF fire department we at that point I realized I never really had enough time I was too busy putting out the fires and not enough time to understand what was driving not just the individual episodes but why was there an epidemic of these happening around the world I left UNICEF and went back to research applied research and I set up in 2010 what I called the vaccine confidence project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine I convened anthropologists epidemiologists psychologists digital media specialists and mathematical modelers we set ourselves the task to investigate historic episodes of rumors and their impacts from trying to figure out what were the early signals what were the amplifying factors and the impacts how did they get traction so we could start to understand what we should be looking for how we could help governments and immunization program be more alert and responsive to early signals of problems it was an early warning system in 2015 we developed a vaccine confidence index it's a it's a survey with trying to investigate to what extent two people agree or disagree that vaccines are important they're safe they're effective they work and somehow they're compatible with my religious beliefs we've run this with over a hundreds of thousands of people around the world trying to get our finger on the pulse of confidence and trust but also more importantly looking at when that trust goes up or down because we want to see when it starts to decline that's the time to jump in to get there before there's a crisis like the Nigerian one we also set up 24/7 media and social media monitoring around the world multi-language listening for what's going on on vaccine conversations trying to pick up early concerns or changes in sentiment that we should be paying attention to we've created an ecosystem of different types of information to try to understand what are the public thinking and how can we engage we look for early signals when we find one we have a global network of collaborators in a number of countries who have more local intelligence in that setting to try to understand is this signal misinformation or something brewing that we should know about in London we have a bigger picture we watched the swarms of rumors not just traveling locally but jumping countries we've seen them jump from Japan over to Colombia through Europe and around they move we live in a hyper-connected environment one of the things that we found fascinating and we've learned a lot in the last 10 years this is our 10th anniversary this didn't start yesterday this rumor problem and one of the things we've learned is in our global monitoring that Europe is the most skeptical region in the world France won the prize actually by far and actually some of those rumors have traveled to other parts of the world but we are trying to understand Europe hmm why Europe I thought the US was really had some of the most skepticism but boy I was wrong and a political scientist a colleague we work with John Kennedy he took our data from 28 European countries and he looked at it and correlated with political opinion polling and what did he find he found that people who were most likely to vote for a populist party also were the ones that most likely to strongly disagree that vaccines were important safe were effective what did we learn vaccines cannot escape the political and social turbulence that surrounds it scientists were unprepared for this tsunami of doubt and questions and distrust what why are vaccines so ripe for resistance well we identified a number of things but one they're highly mediated by government that require regulates and sometimes recommends vaccines or often recommends and sometimes requires big business makes vaccines and neither institution government or big business are high in the trust ranks these days and then there's scientists who discover and develop vaccines and they're pretty elite and not accessible to the general public at least the language they third we're in a hyper-connected environment with social media these days and people can share their unfettered views concerns anxieties and worries and find a lot of people that think the way they do and think maybe their worries are worth paying attention to and finally vaccines touch every single life on the planet what are their health intervention besides water touches every single life so if you're looking for something to disrupt it's a perfect stage people are asking all kinds of questions they're asking why are vaccines and these are the kinds of things we're hearing in our social media why can't my child have a personalized vaccination schedule what's the wisdom of so many vaccines what about all those ingredients and preservatives these are not crazy people they're not uneducated they're actually worried mothers but some of them have come to me and say we feel ignored we feel judged if we ask a question and we even feel demonized that maybe were part of some anti vaccine group so we have some listening to do and maybe that's why last year there was research that found that in six months in 2019 on online this was with hundreds a hundred million different users in social media although the numbers of individuals who expressed in their online groups they were positive as groups the ones who are the most negative were recruiting the conversations in the middle that were undecided about whether they wanted to get vaccines the highly negative what we might call the anti vaccine groups we're recruiting the undecided at a rate 500% faster than the pro-vaccine groups 500% faster they were more nimble they were responsive and they were listening most people believe that vaccines are good and they believe in their importance but that belief is under attack we need to build in more opportunities for conversation and there are ways to do it it's not easy for some health professionals to have conversations where their authority is questioned it's uncomfortable and they're just too busy to listen to all these questions but we need to do something about that because we're losing a lot of concerned parents that just want a conversation we should get volunteers trained to sit in waiting rooms to be on hotlines to have online chat forms to have chat boxes in younger kids with younger kids in school teach them about immune systems and teach them that actually you know that vaccine your little brother got well it just inspired your natural immune system it's a great thing and this is why we need to build that confidence we need to listen despite all this questioning and there's a lot of it I hear probably more than a lot of people I am an optimist and my optimism is with a younger generation the younger generation who actually now are becoming very aware of the risks of social media the false news the false identities and they're starting to embrace science and some of them are a group of children whose mothers refuse to vaccinate them last spring of twenty nineteen eighteen year old Ethan Lindenberg went on reddit and put out a post my mother doesn't believe in vaccines she's really worried they cause autism in fact she strongly believes that but I'm 18 I'm a senior in high school I can drive a car I can vote and I could go get my own vaccine can someone tell me where to get it that post went viral it started to get a whole younger movement going I saw Ethan speak at a conference the global vaccine summit at the EU last fall he spoke eloquently and I was impressed in front of a whole forum and he said he told his personal story and then he said to the group he said you know everybody talks about misinformation but I want to tell you about a different kind of misinformation and that's misinformation that says that people like my mother who is a loving mother is a bad person because she doesn't give me a vaccines well I want to tell all of you that she didn't give me a vaccine because she loves me and because she believed that that was the best thing for me I think differently and I will never change her mind but she's not a bad person that was the message from a teenager empathy kindness and understanding we have an abundance of scientific information to debunk false rumors that's not our problem we have a relationship problem not a misinformation problem misinformation is the symptom not the cause if people trust they'll put up with a little risk to avert a much bigger one the one thing that I want and I hope for is that we as a medical and health community have the moral courage and humility to productively engage like Ethan with those who disagree with us I hope so thank you [Applause] [Music]"},

{"page": 111, "lesson": 15, "title": "A brief history of the Israel-Palestine conflict", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/yJFsMZdR", "transcript": {"en": "Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course World History, and today, we're going to talk about Israel and Palestine, hopefully, without a flame war. Yeah, yeah big ask, Mr. Green, I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago... there wasn't an Islam yet, so, yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac, or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Gelvin and discuss competing nationalisms. [Theme Music] Ok, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jawhariyyeh grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. The late 19th century was the Golden Age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Hapsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hyper-nationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, \"The establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people,\" a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman, as they hadn't yet lost World War One. Of course, they would soon, but it turned out that the British were overpromisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state including Palestine if he led an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule,\nwhich Hussein promptly did, so basically the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves, at which point the people living in Palestine were like, \"Well, now seems good,\" and the British were like, \"Yeah, but maybe not just yet.\" Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate and easier for the British to, quote, \"divide and rule\" the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, \"facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions.\" Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course, these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians between the 1920s and the 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936, when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper, limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine, and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within ten years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting ten years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, \"Oh hey there, United Nations! For your first problem...\" So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The Partition Plan called for two states roughly equal in size, but the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, \"Yeah, that's gonna work!\" Sure enough, it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled and later annexed the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this was was the beginning of their nation; to the Palestinians, it was the nakba, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then, in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six-Days War because -- get this -- it lasted six days. Israel won, and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this; by 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242 - man, they are good at naming resolutions! - which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This of course did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like, there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used nonviolent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state, and meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem, and these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first intifada, which literally means \"shaking off.\" And this began with, like, boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes, but when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the First Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords,\nand the peace process, based on our old friend, United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve - I mean, putting aside the question of, like, how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement, and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine. Water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated! So then came the Clinton talks. Oh, it's time for the Open Letter! But first, let's see what's inside of the globe. Oh, look! It's a collection of philandering American presidents. An Open Letter to Bill Clinton: Hey, Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any other time in the past; even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of... neeeeh. Kind of like your presidency, actually! At least you always have those vodkas-soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best Wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed; Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then, in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third-holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the events sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than three thousand Palestinians and one thousand Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 War, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense; to Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then, in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel; Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects the consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory. And they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true! It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionists and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory Period. But let's hope that by understanding this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

{"page": 111, "lesson": 16, "title": "What causes migraines? - Marianne Schwarz", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-migraines-marianne-schwarz", "transcript": {"en": "A throbbing, pounding headache. Bright zigzagging lines \nacross your field of vision. Sensitivity to light, lingering fatigue, \ndisrupted sleep. A migraine can include any\nof these symptoms. While an incapacitating headache is one of\nthe most common experiences of migraine, the word “headache” doesn’t really capture\nthe wide array of experiences a migraine can entail. No two are alike,\nand some don’t even involve a headache. So what then is a migraine?\nWhat’s happening in the brain to cause it? To trace a migraine’s anatomy, we have to begin in the days and hours \nleading up to a migraine, when people often identify warning signs \nranging from fatigue or mood changes, to bursts of yawning,\nsleep disruption, nausea, light and sound sensitivity,\nor even increased thirst. These warning signs point \nto a particular part of the brain: the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus normally controls \nthe systems behind these symptoms— our body’s internal hormonal balances,\ncircadian rhythms and water regulation. It has wide connections\nthroughout the brain, and is more active than usual\nin the days before migraine. Another common warning sign\nis the migraine aura, which can take the form \nof transient visual changes, tingling, or even trouble speaking. These sensations come from a change \nin charge across cell membranes that leads to spreading changes in brain \nactivity and blood flow across the brain. We don't know what triggers\nthis change in charge, but it can spread quickly \nover the surface of the brain, causing different aura symptoms \ndepending on the affected area. If it inches over the visual cortex,\nfor example, it may cause an image or blind spot\nto spread over the visual field. During the headache phase, \nthe trigeminal nerve plays a key role. The trigeminal nerve normally transmits \ntouch, temperature, and other sensations from the skin to most of the face, \npart of the scalp, and some of the blood vessels\nand layers covering the cerebral cortex. Once activated, the trigeminal nerve\ntransmits pain signals. During a migraine, this pain pathway \nbecomes sensitized, meaning the threshold for provoking\npain is lowered. Sensations that would usually \nbe pain-free, such as coughing, bending over, \nor light and sound, can become painful. Migraines are as common\nas they are diverse, affecting as many as 33% of women\nand 13% of men in their lifetimes. Still, there’s much we don’t know \nabout them. We can see that migraine \nis a neurological disorder affecting multiple parts of the brain— the brainstem, cerebral hemispheres,\nand the nerves themselves. But we don't know for sure what\nexactly triggers each step, why some people get migraines\nand not others, why so many more women do than men, or why people’s migraine patterns\nsometimes change over their lifetimes. Hormonal fluctuations are thought to have\na role in some of these things: some women experience a significant\nreduction in migraine frequency after menopause, \nwhen sex hormone fluctuations are fewer. Meanwhile, just before menopause,\nthese fluctuations increase, and some women experience \nworsening or new headaches. People with migraines\nare more likely to suffer from depression, panic disorder, sleep disorders, \nand strokes, among other illnesses. The relationship with these diseases\nis likely complex, possibly reflecting the effect of migraine\non those diseases or vice versa, or reflecting their shared genetic basis. Genetics almost certainly play a role,\nalthough with a few exceptions, there’s no single gene \nthat causes migraines.

When we have to work\nout the cause of a condition— for example, with multiple sclerosis\nor heart disease— developing a new drug takes significant\ntrial and error and lots of money. Which is why we only have drugs \nfor a small proportion of diseases. But you could change all this. You could help discover new, cheaper drugs\nfor currently untreatable diseases. It's all about medical crowdsourcing. However, researchers aren’t asking\nyou to donate your money, they’re asking you to donate\nsomething more personal... First, though, some drug development \nhistory. Many of the first medicines\nwere discovered by chance. Natural philosophers \nthen took these and identified the active chemicals \ninside. And pharmaceutical companies \nthen turned those into drugs. The thing is, for a long time, we didn’t\nknow why those drugs worked. Until scientists figured out that disease \nhappens when the molecular machines that keep your body going— your proteins—\nstart misbehaving. Drugs treat disease by targeting \nthose disruptive proteins. Researchers realized\nthat if they can identify which malfunctioning proteins cause\na specific disease, they can then try to find \nor develop a drug that stops those proteins acting up, \nand that will prevent the disease. It’s a great plan, \nbut it’s a slow process. So far, they’ve only identified\nthese therapeutic targets for a small proportion of diseases. However,\nthis is where you can help. Researchers are now turning\ntheir attention to DNA, to the genetic instruction manual that\ntells our bodies how to make our proteins. They want to know which small changes\nin someone’s genome can lead to the production of those \ndodgy proteins that cause a disease. The thing is, that’s a big job. DNA is huge, and each disease is likely \nto have hundreds, possibly thousands, of proteins involved. But if they have lots of people’s genomes,\nthey can compare them and spot patterns. They can look at multiple people \nsuffering from the same currently untreatable disease, find any small genetic changes they share, identify the faulty proteins \nthey code for, and there you go: \nthose are brand new therapeutic targets for a currently untreatable disease. Now the researchers have three options: 1. Has one of those new target proteins\nbeen previously linked to a different disease that is treatable? If so, the drug for that disease \nmay target  this protein and work for this disease, too. To find out, start a clinical trial. 2. If not, has one of those new target\nproteins being previously linked to a different disease that had \na promising drug that didn’t ultimately work? If so, its promise may have come \nfrom successfully targeting this protein and it may work for this disease. Start a clinical trial to find out. 3. If this is a brand new protein target \nnever identified before for any disease could they design\na new drug to affect it? This involves AI machine learning\nand some very cool chemistry. And a lot of time, effort, and cost too. Researchers are excited about all this \nbecause they think 1 in 5 of the proteins in your body \neither have, or are likely to have, a drug that will bind to them. And, as any common disease is likely \nto have hundreds, possibly thousands, of proteins involved, they’re hopeful they’ll be able \nto identify a few of those proteins they’ve already got a drug for. But this all relies on finding \nthose new therapeutic targets, and that's why they need you. Well, your data— both your genetic data\nand your health history data, so they can compare the genomes \nof people with similar conditions. So would you give your data for research? There are two questions you may have: who will have access to my data,\nand what could they do with it? One group is health care providers \nwho are starting to consider using genetic analysis to give patients\nmore personal care. Another group is private consumer\ngenetic testing companies. Some have already sold genetic data \non to pharmaceutical companies for profit, but that was with their customers consent. However, it raises another question: if your data goes towards \nmaking new drugs, should pharmaceutical companies\nrecognize that contribution and offer drugs more cheaply? Your best bet is to research the\norganizations who are asking for your data to find out what they will do with it \nand how they will protect it. We’ll each have our own take on this, but what is clear is genomics \ncould be a powerful tool to cut the current time and cost \nit takes to develop new drugs for currently untreatable diseases.

{"page": 111, "lesson": 18, "title": "The electrical blueprints that orchestrate life - Michael Levin", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-electrical-blueprints-that-orchestrate-life-michael-levin", "transcript": {"en": "Chris Anderson: Mike, welcome. It's good to see you.\nI'm excited for this conversation. Michael Levin: Thank you so much.\nI'm so happy to be here. CA: So, most of us have\nthis mental model in biology that DNA is a property\nof every living thing, that it is kind of the software\nthat builds the hardware of our body. That's how a lot of us think about this. That model leaves too many deep mysteries. Can you share with us\nsome of those mysteries and also what tadpoles have to do with it? ML: Sure. Yeah. I'd like to give you another\nperspective on this problem. One of the things that DNA does\nis specify the hardware of each cell. So the DNA tells every cell\nwhat proteins it's supposed to have. And so when you have\ntadpoles, for example, you see the kind of thing that most people think is sort of\na progressive unrolling of the genome. Specific genes turn on and off, and a tadpole, as it becomes a frog, has to rearrange its face. So the eyes, the nostrils, the jaws --\neverything has to move. And one way to think about it\nused to be that, well, you have a sort of hardwired\nset of movements where all of these things move around\nand then you get your frog. But actually, a few years ago,\nwe found a pretty amazing phenomenon, which is that if you make\nso-called \"Picasso frogs\" -- these are tadpoles where the jaws\nmight be off to the side, the eyes are up here,\nthe nostrils are moved, so everything is shifted -- these tadpoles make\nlargely normal frog faces. Now, this is amazing, because all of the organs\nstart off in abnormal positions, and yet they still end up making\na pretty good frog face. And so what it turns out\nis that this system, like many living systems, is not a hardwired set of movements, but actually works to reduce the error\nbetween what's going on now and what it knows is a correct\nfrog face configuration. This kind of decision-making that involves flexible responses\nto new circumstances, in other contexts,\nwe would call this intelligence. And so what we need to understand now\nis not only the mechanisms by which these cells\nexecute their movements and gene expression and so on, but we really have to understand\nthe information flow: How do these cells\ncooperate with each other to build something large\nand to stop building when that specific structure is created? And these kinds of computations,\nnot just the mechanisms, but the computations\nof anatomical control, are the future of biology. CA: And so I guess the traditional model is that somehow cells are sending\nbiochemical signals to each other that allow that development\nto happen the smart way. But you think there is\nsomething else at work. What is that? ML: Well, cells certainly do communicate\nbiochemically and via physical forces, but there's something else going on\nthat's extremely interesting, and it's basically called bioelectricity, non-neural bioelectricity. So it turns out that all cells -- not just nerves,\nbut all cells in your body -- communicate with each other\nusing electrical signals. And what you're seeing here\nis a time-lapse video. For the first time, we are now able to eavesdrop\non all of the electrical conversations that the cells are having with each other. So think about this. We're now watching -- This is an early frog embryo. This is about eight hours\nto 10 hours of development. And the colors are showing you\nactual electrical states that allow you to see\nall of the electrical software that's running on the genome-defined\ncellular hardware. And so these cells are basically\ncommunicating with each other who is going to be head,\nwho is going to be tail, who is going to be left and right\nand make eyes and brain and so on. And so it is this software that allows these living systems\nto achieve specific goals, goals such as building an embryo or regenerating a limb\nfor animals that do this, and the ability to see\nthese electrical conversations gives us some really\nremarkable opportunities to target or to rewrite\nthe goals towards which these living systems are operating. CA: OK, so this is pretty radical. Let me see if I understand this. What you're saying is that\nwhen an organism starts to develop, as soon as a cell divides, electrical signals are shared\nbetween them. But as you get to, what,\na hundred, a few hundred cells, that somehow these signals end up forming\nessentially like a computer program, a program that somehow includes\nall the information needed to tell that organism what its destiny is? Is that the right way to think about it? ML: Yes, quite. Basically, what happens\nis that these cells, by forming electrical networks\nmuch like networks in the brain, they form electrical networks, and these networks process information\nincluding pattern memories. They include representation\nof large-scale anatomical structures where various organs will go, what the different axes of the animal --\nfront and back, head and tail -- are going to be, and these are literally\nheld in the electrical circuits across large tissues in the same way that brains\nhold other kinds of memories and learning. CA: So is this the right way\nto think about it? Because this seems to be such a big shift. I mean, when I first got a computer, I was in awe of the people\nwho could do so-called \"machine code,\" like the direct programming\nof individual bits in the computer. That was impossible for most mortals. To have a chance\nof controlling that computer, you'd have to program in a language, which was a vastly simpler way\nof making big-picture things happen. And if I understand you right, what you're saying is that most of biology\ntoday has sort of taken place trying to do the equivalent\nof machine code programming, of understanding the biochemical signals\nbetween individual cells, when, wait a sec, holy crap,\nthere's this language going on, this electrical language,\nwhich, if you could understand that, that would give us a completely\ndifferent set of insights into how organisms are developing. Is that metaphor basically right? ML: Yeah, this is exactly right. So if you think about the way\nprogramming was done in the '40s, in order to get your computer\nto do something different, you would physically\nhave to shift the wires around. So you'd have to go in there\nand rewire the hardware. You'd have to interact\nwith the hardware directly, and all of your strategies\nfor manipulating that machine would be at the level of the hardware. And the reason we have\nthis now amazing technology revolution, information sciences and so on, is because computer science moved\nfrom a focus on the hardware on to understanding that if\nyour hardware is good enough -- and I'm going to tell you that biological\nhardware is absolutely good enough -- then you can interact with your system\nnot by tweaking or rewiring the hardware, but actually, you can take a step back\nand give it stimuli or inputs the way that you would give\nto a reprogrammable computer and cause the cellular network\nto do something completely different than it would otherwise have done. So the ability to see\nthese bioelectrical signals is giving us an entry point\ndirectly into the software that guides large-scale anatomy, which is a very different\napproach to medicine than to rewiring specific pathways\ninside of every cell. CA: And so in many ways,\nthis is the amazingness of your work is that you're starting to crack the code\nof these electrical signals, and you've got an amazing\ndemonstration of this in these flatworms. Tell us what's going on here. ML: So this is a creature\nknown as a planarian. They're flatworms. They're actually quite a complex creature. They have a true brain,\nlots of different organs and so on. And the amazing thing about these planaria is that they are highly,\nhighly regenerative. So if you cut it into pieces --\nin fact, over 200 pieces -- every piece will rebuild\nexactly what's needed to make a perfect little worm. So think about that. This is a system where every single piece knows exactly what\na correct planarian looks like and builds the right organs\nin the right places and then stops. And that's one of the most\namazing things about regeneration. So what we discovered is that\nif you cut it into three pieces and amputate the head and the tail\nand you just take this middle fragment, which is what you see here, amazingly, there is an electrical\ngradient, head to tail, that's generated that tells the piece\nwhere the heads and the tails go and in fact, how many heads or tails\nyou're supposed to have. So what we learned to do\nis to manipulate this electrical gradient, and the important thing\nis that we don't apply electricity. What we do instead was we turned\non and off the little transistors -- they're actual ion channel proteins -- that every cell natively uses\nto set up this electrical state. So now we have ways\nto turn them on and off, and when you do this,\none of the things you can do is you can shift that circuit\nto a state that says no, build two heads, or in fact, build no heads. And what you're seeing here are real worms\nthat have either two or no heads that result from this, because that electrical map\nis what the cells are using to decide what to do. And so what you're seeing here\nare live two-headed worms. And, having generated these,\nwe did a completely crazy experiment. You take one of these two-headed worms,\nand you chop off both heads, and you leave just\nthe normal middle fragment. Now keep in mind, these animals\nhave not been genomically edited. There's absolutely nothing different\nabout their genomes. Their genome sequence\nis completely wild type. So you amputate the heads,\nyou've got a nice normal fragment, and then you ask: In plain water,\nwhat is it going to do? And, of course, the standard\nparadigm would say, well, if you've gotten rid\nof this ectopic extra tissue, the genome is not edited so it should\nmake a perfectly normal worm. And the amazing thing is\nthat it is not what happens. These worms, when cut again and again,\nin the future, in plain water, they continue to regenerate as two-headed. Think about this. The pattern memory to which these animals\nwill regenerate after damage has been permanently rewritten. And in fact, we can now write it back\nand send them back to being one-headed without any genomic editing. So this right here is telling you\nthat the information structure that tells these worms how many heads\nthey're supposed to have is not directly in the genome. It is in this additional\nbioelectric layer. Probably many other things are as well. And we now have the ability to rewrite it. And that, of course,\nis the key definition of memory. It has to be stable, long-term stable,\nand it has to be rewritable. And we are now beginning to crack\nthis morphogenetic code to ask how is it that these tissues\nstore a map of what to do and how we can go in\nand rewrite that map to new outcomes. CA: I mean, that seems\nincredibly compelling evidence that DNA is just not\ncontrolling the actual final shape of these organisms, that there's this\nwhole other thing going on, and, boy, if you could crack that code, what else could that lead to. By the way, just looking at these ones. What is life like\nfor a two-headed flatworm? I mean, it seems like\nit's kind of a trade-off. The good news is you have this amazing\nthree-dimensional view of the world, but the bad news is you have\nto poop through both of your mouths? ML: So, the worms have\nthese little tubes called pharynxes, and the tubes are sort of\nin the middle of the body, and they excrete through that. These animals are perfectly viable. They're completely happy, I think. The problem, however, is that the two heads\ndon't cooperate all that well, and so they don't really eat very well. But if you manage to feed them by hand, they will go on forever, and in fact, you should know\nthese worms are basically immortal. So these worms, because\nthey are so highly regenerative, they have no age limit, and they're telling us that\nif we crack this secret of regeneration, which is not only growing new cells\nbut knowing when to stop -- you see, this is absolutely crucial -- if you can continue to exert\nthis really profound control over the three-dimensional structures\nthat the cells are working towards, you could defeat aging\nas well as traumatic injury and things like this. So one thing to keep in mind\nis that this ability to rewrite the large-scale anatomical\nstructure of the body is not just a weird planarian trick. It's not just something\nthat works in flatworms. What you're seeing here is a tadpole\nwith an eye and a gut, and what we've done is turned on\na very specific ion channel. So we basically just manipulated\nthese little electrical transistors that are inside of cells, and we've imposed a state\non some of these gut cells that's normally associated\nwith building an eye. And as a result, what the cells do\nis they build an eye. These eyes are complete. They have optic nerve, lens, retina, all the same stuff that an eye\nis supposed to have. They can see, by the way,\nout of these eyes. And what you're seeing here is that by triggering\neye-building subroutines in the physiological software of the body, you can very easily tell it\nto build a complex organ. And this is important for our biomedicine, because we don't know how to micromanage\nthe construction of an eye. I think it's going to be\na really long time before we can really bottom-up build\nthings like eyes or hands and so on. But we don't need to, because the body\nalready knows how to do it, and there are these subroutines\nthat can be triggered by specific electrical patterns\nthat we can find. And this is what we call\n\"cracking the bioelectric code.\" We can make eyes. We can make extra limbs. Here's one of our five-legged tadpoles. We can make extra hearts. We're starting to crack the code\nto understand where are the subroutines in this software that we can trigger\nand build these complex organs long before we actually know\nhow to micromanage the process at the cellular level. CA: So as you've started to get\nto learn this electrical layer and what it can do, you've been able to create -- is it fair to say it's almost\nlike a new, a novel life-form, called a xenobot? Talk to me about xenobots. ML: Right. So if you think about this,\nthis leads to a really strange prediction. If the cells are really willing to build\ntowards a specific map, we could take genetically unaltered cells, and what you're seeing here\nis cells taken out of a frog body. They've coalesced in a way that asks them\nto re-envision their multicellularity. And what you see here is that when liberated from the rest\nof the body of the animal, they make these tiny little novel bodies\nthat are, in terms of behavior, you can see they can move,\nthey can run a maze. They are completely different\nfrom frogs or tadpoles. Frog cells, when asked to re-envision\nwhat kind of body they want to make, do something incredibly interesting. They use the hardware\nthat their genetics gives them, for example, these\nlittle hairs, these little cilia that are normally used to redistribute\nmucus on the outside of a frog, those are genetically specified. But what these creatures did, because the cells are able\nto form novel kinds of bodies, they have figured out\nhow to use these little cilia to instead row against the water,\nand now have locomotion. So not only can they move around,\nbut they can, and here what you're seeing, is that these cells\nare coalescing together. Now they're starting to have conversations\nabout what they are going to do. You can see here the flashes\nare these exchanges of information. Keep in mind, this is just skin. There is no nervous system.\nThere is no brain. This is just skin. This is skin that has learned\nto make a new body and to explore its environment\nand move around. And they have spontaneous behaviors. You can see here where\nit's swimming down this maze. At this point, it decides to turn around\nand go back where it came from. So it has its own behavior,\nand this is a remarkable model system for several reasons. First of all, it shows us\nthe amazing plasticity of cells that are genetically wild type. There is no genetic editing here. These are cells that are really prone\nto making some sort of functional body. The second thing, and this was done in collaboration\nwith Josh Bongard's lab at UVM, they modeled the structure of these things\nand evolved it in a virtual world. So this is literally -- on a computer,\nthey modeled it on a computer. So this is literally the only organism\nthat I know of on the face of this planet whose evolution took place\nnot in the biosphere of the earth but inside a computer. So the individual cells\nhave an evolutionary history, but this organism\nhas never existed before. It was evolved in this virtual world, and then we went ahead\nand made it in the lab, and you can see this amazing plasticity. This is not only\nfor making useful machines. You can imagine now programming these\nto go out into the environment and collect toxins and cleanup, or you could imagine ones\nmade out of human cells that would go through your body\nand collect cancer cells or reshape arthritic joints, deliver pro-regenerative compounds, all kinds of things. But not only these useful applications --\nthis is an amazing sandbox for learning to communicate\nmorphogenetic signals to cell collectives. So once we crack this, once we understand\nhow these cells decide what to do, and then we're going to, of course,\nlearn to rewrite that information, the next steps are great improvements\nin regenerative medicine, because we will then be able\nto tell cells to build healthy organs. And so this is now\na really critical opportunity to learn to communicate with cell groups, not to micromanage them,\nnot to force the hardware, to communicate and rewrite the goals\nthat these cells are trying to accomplish. CA: Well, it's mind-boggling stuff. Finally, Mike, give us\njust one other story about medicine that might be to come as you develop this understanding of how this bioelectric layer works. ML: Yeah, this is incredibly exciting\nbecause, if you think about it, most of the problems of biomedicine -- birth defects, degenerative disease,\naging, traumatic injury, even cancer -- all boil down to one thing: cells are not building\nwhat you would like them to build. And so if we understood\nhow to communicate with these collectives and really rewrite\ntheir target morphologies, we would be able to normalize tumors, we would be able to repair birth defects, induce regeneration of limbs\nand other organs, and these are things\nwe have already done in frog models. And so now the next really exciting step is to take this into mammalian cells and to really turn this into the next\ngeneration of regenerative medicine where we learn to address\nall of these biomedical needs by communicating with the cell collectives and rewriting their bioelectric\npattern memories. And the final thing I'd like to say\nis that the importance of this field is not only for biomedicine. You see, this, as I started out by saying, this ability of cells\nin novel environments to build all kinds of things\nbesides what their genome tells them is an example of intelligence, and biology has been\nintelligently solving problems long before brains came on the scene. And so this is also the beginnings\nof a new inspiration for machine learning that mimics the artificial intelligence\nof body cells, not just brains, for applications in computer intelligence. CA: Mike Levin, thank you\nfor your extraordinary work and for sharing it\nso compellingly with us. Thank you. ML: Thank you so much. Thank you, Chris."}, "multiple-choice": []}

It’s not a shark or a killer whale. It’s the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The largest and longest-lived\nof the 15 tuna species, the Atlantic bluefin has a unique set\nof adaptations that make it one of the most dominant \npredators in the ocean. It starts as a tiny hatchling in the \nGulf of Mexico or the Mediterranean Sea, no bigger than a human eyelash. Within its first year of life, It develops something known as \nregional endothermy— the ability to regulate\nits body temperature. An Atlantic bluefin gets oxygen \nfrom cold ocean water using its gills. This process cools its blood. Then, heat the tuna generates swimming \nand hunting warms the blood. In most fishes, this heat would be lost\nback out into the ocean through the gills. But in the Atlantic bluefin, a mechanism called countercurrent exchange\ntraps the heat. Cold blood on its way \nto the large swimming muscles passes close to warm blood \nleaving those muscles in a specialized network of blood vessels \nknown as a rete mirabile. Here the heat “jumps” to the cold blood\nand stays in the body. This makes bluefin one of the few \nwarm-blooded fishes, a huge advantage \nin the marine environment. Cold-blooded animals whose \nbody temperature depends entirely on the environment become\nsluggish in colder waters. But a bluefin’s ability to keep warm\nmeans it has sharper vision, can better process information,\nand can swim faster than its prey. It thrives in cold, deep, subarctic water. Thanks to their warm bloodedness, \ntheir powerful muscles, and their streamlined torpedo shape with fins that fold into grooves \nto reduce drag, bluefin tuna can reach speeds\nfew other animals can match. Their maximum speed of 40 miles per hour is faster than that of a great white shark\nor orca whale, and even at their comfortable \ncruising speed, they can cross the Atlantic\nin a couple months. All this swimming requires\na great deal of oxygen, but the bluefin is adapted\nfor this as well. The faster it swims, the more water\npasses over its gills, and the more oxygen it can absorb\nfrom that water. This need for a constant flow of water means the tuna must always remain \non the move. It also means bluefin cannot suck prey \ninto their mouths the way most other fishes do. Instead, they must chase down \ntheir prey with their mouths open. They eat smaller prey than most predators\ntheir size, including squid, crustaceans,\nand smaller fish species like mackerel. The bluefin’s temperature-regulating\nability doesn’t just make it a superior hunter— \nit gives it nearly unlimited range. As soon as they’re strong enough to swim\nagainst the current, Atlantic bluefin leave the warm waters \nof their spawning grounds and spend their lives hunting\nall over the Atlantic Ocean. Tunas from both the Gulf of Mexico \nand the Mediterranean Sea frequent the same feeding grounds and range from Brazil and Texas \nto Iceland and Senegal and beyond. But when the time comes\nto reproduce around age 10, they always return to their sea of origin. Here, groups of males and females release\nmillions of eggs and sperm into the water. They’ll migrate back and forth between \nfeeding and spawning grounds annually for the rest of their lives. Atlantic bluefin can live \nfor over 40 years, growing all the while. The largest specimens are tens of millions\nof times heavier than when they hatched. The same huge size that makes\nbluefin tuna indomitable in the ocean has made them vulnerable\nto one predator in particular: us. Humans have a long history\nof fishing Atlantic bluefin— it’s even stamped on ancient Greek coins. But in recent decades, \ndemand has skyrocketed as bluefin are hunted for sashimi, sushi, \nand tuna steaks.

My dad gets off a flight from Australia\nwith one thing in mind and it's not a snack or a shower or a nap. It's November 2016 and Dad is here to talk to Americans\nabout the election. Now, Dad's a news fiend, but for him, this is not just red or blue,\nswing states or party platforms. He has some really specific intentions. He wants to listen,\nbe heard and understand. And over two weeks,\nhe has hundreds of conversations with Americans from\nNew Hampshire to Miami. Some of them are tough conversations, complete differences of opinions, wildly different worldviews, radically opposite life experiences. But in all of those interactions, Dad walks away\nwith a big smile on his face and so does the other person. You can see one of them here. And in those interactions, he's having a version\nof what it seems like we have less of, but want more of -- a constructive conversation. We have more ways than ever to connect. And yet, politically, ideologically, it feels like we are further\nand further apart. We tell pollsters that we want\npoliticians who are open-minded. And yet when they change\ntheir point of view, we say that they lacked conviction. For us, when we're confronted\nwith information that challenges an existing worldview, our tendency is not to open up,\nit's to double down. We even have a term for it\nin social psychology. It's called belief perseverance. And boy, do some people's beliefs\nseem to persevere. I'm no stranger to tough conversations. I got my start in what I now call\nproductive disagreement in high school debate. I even went on to win the World Schools Debate\nChampionship three times. I've been in a lot of arguments,\nis what I'm saying, but it took watching my dad\non the streets of the US to understand\nthat we need to figure out how we go into conversations. Not looking for the victory,\nbut the progress. And so since November 2016,\nthat's what I've been doing. Working with governments,\nfoundations, corporations, families, to uncover the tools and techniques that allow us to talk when it feels\nlike the divide is unbridgeable. And constructive conversations\nthat really move the dialogue forward have these same three essential features. First, at least one party\nin the conversation is willing to choose curiosity over clash. They're open to the idea\nthat the discussion is a climbing wall, not a cage fight, that they'll make progress over time and are able to anchor all of that\nin purpose of the discussion. For someone trained in formal debate, it is so tempting to run headlong\nat the disagreement. In fact, we call that clash and in formal argumentation, it's a punishable offense\nif there's not enough of it. But I've noticed,\nyou've probably noticed, too, that in real life that tends\nto make people shut down, not just from the conversation, but even from the relationship. It's actually one of the causes\nof unfriending, online and off. So instead, you might consider a technique made popular by the Hollywood\nproducer Brian Grazer, the curiosity conversation. And the whole point\nof a curiosity conversation is to understand\nthe other person's perspective, to see what's on their side of the fence. And so the next time that someone says something\nyou instinctively disagree with, that you react violently to, you only need one sentence\nand one question: “I never thought about it\nexactly that way before. What can you share\nthat would help me see what you see?” What's remarkable\nabout curiosity conversations is that the people you are curious about\ntend to become curious about you. Whether it's a friendly\nAustralian gentleman, a political foe or a corporate rival, they begin to wonder\nwhat it is that you see and whether they could see it to. Constructive conversations\naren't a one-shot deal. If you go into an encounter\nexpecting everyone to walk out with the same point of view\nthat you walked in with, there's really no chance for progress. Instead, we need to think\nabout conversations as a climbing wall to do a variant of what\nmy dad did during this trip, pocketing a little nugget\nof information here, adapting his approach there. That's actually a technique\nborrowed from formal debate where you present an idea, it's attacked and you adapt\nand re-explain, it's attacked again, you adapt and re-explain. The whole expectation\nis that your idea gets better through challenge and criticism. And the evidence from really high-stakes\ninternational negotiations suggests that that's what successful\nnegotiators do as well. They go into conversations expecting to learn from the challenges\nthat they will receive to use objections to make their ideas\nand proposals better. Development is in some way a service\nthat we can do for others and that others can do for us. It makes the ideas sharper, but the relationships warmer. Curiosity can be relationship magic and development can be\nrocket fuel for your ideas. But there are some situations where it just feels\nlike it's not worth the bother. And in those cases it can be because the purpose\nof the discussion isn't clear. I think back to how my dad\nwent into those conversations with a really clear sense of purpose. He was there to learn, to listen,\nto share his point of view. And once that purpose\nis understood by both parties, then you can begin to move on. Lay out our vision for the future. Make a decision. Get funding. Then you can move on to principles. When people shared with my dad\ntheir hopes for America, that's where they started\nwith the big picture, not with personality\nor politics or policies. Because inadvertently\nthey were doing something that we do naturally with outsiders and find it really difficult sometimes\nto do with insiders. They painted in broad strokes before digging into the details. But maybe you live in the same\nzip code or the same house and it feels like none\nof that common ground is there today. Then you might consider a version\nof disagreement time travel, asking your counterpart to articulate\nwhat kind of neighborhood, country, world, community, they want a year from now, a decade from now. It is very tempting\nto dwell in present tensions and get bogged down in practicalities. Inviting people to inhabit\na future possibility opens up the chance\nof a conversation with purpose. Earlier in my career, I worked for the deputy\nprime minister of New Zealand who practiced a version of this technique. New Zealand's electoral system\nis designed for unlikely friendships, coalitions, alliances, memoranda of understanding\nare almost inevitable. And this particular government set-up\nhad some of almost everything -- small government conservatives, liberals, the Indigenous people's party,\nthe Green Party. And I recently asked him, what does it take to bring\na group like that together but hold them together? He said, \"Someone, you,\nhas to take responsibility for reminding them\nof their shared purpose: caring for people.” If we are more focused\non what makes us different than the same, then every debate is a fight. If we put our challenges\nand our problems before us, then every potential ally\nbecomes an adversary. But as my dad packed his bags\nfor the three flights, 25 hours, 10,000 miles back to Australia, he was also packing a collection\nof new perspectives, a new way of navigating conversations, and a whole set of new stories\nand experiences to share. But he was also leaving those behind with everyone that he'd interacted with. We love unlikely friendships\nwhen they look like this. We've just forgotten how to make them. And amid the cacophony of cable news and the awkwardness of family dinners, and the hostility of corporate meetings, each of us has this -- the opportunity\nto walk into every encounter, like my dad walked off that plane, to choose curiosity over clash, to expect development\nof your ideas through discussion and to anchor in common purpose. That's what really\nworld-class persuaders do to build constructive conversations and move them forward. It's how our world will move forward too. Thank you."}, "multiple-choice": []}

Mednick", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-long-should-your-naps-be-sara-c-mednick", "transcript": {"en": "Your eyes get heavy and gradually... \nclose... But wait! It’s only lunchtime\nand you still have so much to do. Would taking a nap help?\nOr would it derail your day? Our sleep, both at night and in naps, is made up of approximately 90 minute\nsleep cycles with four stages each. A nap can last anywhere from five minutes\nto three hours, so it can include full sleep cycles\nor just a few stages. As you fall asleep, you enter Stage 1:\nthe first two to five minutes of sleep. Stage 2 comes next, for about 30 minutes. In Stage 2, body temperature drops, \nmuscles relax, and breathing and heart rate \nbecome more regular. Your neurons start to fire in unison, creating waves of activity \nthat sweep across the cortex, punctuated by rapid bursts \nof neural activity called sleep spindles. As you enter Stage 3,\nor slow wave sleep, the rolling waves increase as your neurons\nfire in coordination. This phase lasts about 20 to 30 minutes\nand is where your deepest sleep occurs. Then, you enter REM sleep, which lasts\nabout 10 to 20 minutes in a nap. In REM, the brain becomes more active,\nmore like your brain activity while awake. The end of REM signals \nthe completion of a sleep cycle. OK, but will a nap make you feel better? Well, that depends on a few things— especially what stages of sleep\nthe nap includes. Take a 30 minute nap, \nwhich consists mainly of Stage 2 sleep. Stage 2 sleep is associated \nwith long-term potentiation, a process that's thought to strengthen\nthe synapses between neurons, which is essential for learning. A 20 to 30 minute nap stops short\nof Stage 3′s deep sleep, making it relatively easy to wake up from. A 30 to 60 minute nap, meanwhile,\nhas the benefits of Stage 2 sleep and also takes you into the deeper sleep \nof Stage 3. During Stage 3, multiple brain areas\nwork together to transfer information from short-term memory storage\nto long-term storage, stabilizing and strengthening \nlong-term memory by coupling sleep spindles \nwith slow waves. Stage 3 is the most difficult stage \nto wake up from. So while a 30 to 60 minute nap\ncan have cognitive benefits, those benefits often don’t kick in until \nabout 15 minutes after waking up. 60 to 90 minute naps enter the REM stage. While in REM, the prefrontal cortex, which is largely responsible \nfor inhibition and cognitive control, becomes much less active. Meanwhile, the amygdala \nand cingulate cortex, regions associated with emotion \nand motivation, are highly active. Researchers have posited that \nthe combination of these things leads to bizarre dreams during REM sleep: the decrease in inhibition and cognitive\ncontrol might lead to wild associations— and, thanks to the amygdala \nand cingulate cortex activity, those associations can be \nbetween emotionally charged topics. Some researchers think this stage might\nhelp us make innovative connections between ideas upon waking. Because the brain activity during\nREM is closer to waking, it may be easier to wake up from REM \nthan Stage 3, even though the nap is longer. The time of day also matters. Our need for deep Stage 3 sleep \nprogressively increases throughout the day. So if you nap later, you may rob yourself of the sleep pressure\nneeded to go to sleep at night. This doesn't happen for REM sleep. Longer periods of REM occur\nduring morning hours, so morning naps are dominated by REM, midday naps have about equal parts\nof REM and deep sleep, and evening naps contain more deep sleep. On top of all this, it seems \nthat we’re just about evenly split between nappers and non-nappers. Nappers consistently show\ncognitive benefits from napping, but non-nappers may not. Researchers think this could be \nbecause nappers are able to stay in a lighter sleep\nand move through sleep stages more easily. Meanwhile, non-nappers may experience\nmore deep sleep while napping, making them groggy afterward. So will a nap help?

Shasha", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-you-solve-dongle-s-difficult-dilemma-dennis-e-shasha", "transcript": {"en": "According to legend, \nwhen this planet was young and molten, three galactic terraformers\nshaped it into a paradise. When their work was done, \nthey sought out new worlds, but left the source of their power behind: three powerful golden hexagons, hidden within dungeons \nfull of traps and monsters. If one person were to bring all\nthree hexagons together, they could reinvent the world\nhowever they saw fit. That was thousands of years ago. Today, you’ve learned of Gordon, an evil \nwizard dead set on collecting the hexagons and enslaving the world to his will. So you set off on a quest \nto get them first, adventuring through fire, ice, and sand. Yet each time, you find that someone else \ngot there first. Not Gordon, but a merchant named Dongle. At the end of the third dungeon. you find\na note inviting you to Dongle’s castle. You show up with a wallet bursting \nwith the 99 gems you’ve collected in your travels, arriving just moments before Gordon, \nwho also has 99 gems. Dongle has not only collected \nthe golden hexagons, but he’s used them to create \n5 silver hexagons, just as powerful \nas their golden counterparts. Why did Dongle do all this? Because there’s one thing he loves\nabove all else: auctions. You and the evil wizard will compete\nto win the hexagons, starting with the three golden ones, making one bid for each item \nas it comes up. The winners of ties will alternate, \nstarting with you. Whoever first collects a trio \nof either golden or silver hexagons can use their power to recreate the world. You’ve already bid 24 gems on the first, when you realize that your rival\nhas a dastardly advantage: a mirror that lets him see\nwhat you’re bidding. He bids zero, \nand you win the first hexagon outright. What’s your strategy to win a matching\ntrio of hexagons before your rival? Pause here to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 Dongle’s dangled a difficult dilemma. Do you spend big to try to win \nthe golden hexagons outright? Save as much as possible for silver?\nOr something in-between? Gordon can use his magic mirror \nand 99 gems to make sure that no matter what you bid \non the second gold, he can bid one more and block you. So the real question is— how can you force\nGordon to spend enough on the golds to guarantee that you’ll win\non the silvers? Here’s a hint. Let’s say at the start \nof the silver auctions you had a one gem advantage, \nsuch as 9 to 8. You need to win three auctions, so could you divide your gems \ninto three groups of three and win? For simplicity, let’s assume \na set of rules that’s worse for you, where Gordon wins every tie. If you bid 3 each time, \nthe best he could do is win two silver hexagons, \nand have two gems left— which you’ll beat with\nthree bids of 3. Any one-gem advantage where your\nstarting total is divisible by three will lead to victory by the same logic. So knowing that, how can you force\nGordon's hand in the gold auctions so you go into silver with an advantage? Let’s first imagine that Gordon lets \nyou win the second gold auction by betting some amount X with a tie. You could then bid everything you have\nleft on the third gold hexagon, and he'd have to match you to block. So if you could bid 51 on the third gold, you'd go into silver with a 51 to 48\nadvantage, which you know you can win. Solving for X reveals that in order\nto have 51 on round three, you should bid at most 24 on round two. But what about the other possibility, where Gordon wins the second gold \nagainst your bid of 24— would this strategy still work? The least he could bid to win\nthe second gold is 25, making the total 75 to Gordon’s 74. No one would then bid on round three, since you’ve each blocked the other \nfrom getting three golds. After that, you could bid 25 \nevery time to win three silvers. The bidding war was close, but your ingenuity kept you one link\nahead in the chain of inference, and the silver tri-source is yours. Now... what will you do with it?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Suppose there are only silver hexagons. Player A has 100 gems and player B has 99. However, player B wins on every tie.

One of these creatures is thought \nto possess the world’s most painful insect sting. If you were to guess, would it be: the ant that forages \nin rainforest canopies? The bee that protects a hive\nof delectable honey? Or the wasp that paralyzes tarantulas? Let’s find out! Ant, bee, and wasp venoms contain \na variable cocktail of compounds designed to incite unsavory sensations \nand even compromise bodily functions. Entomologist Justin O. Schmidt’s \nsting pain index describes and ranks the pain \nof around 100 kinds of insect stings. One of our three competitors\nclaims the nastiest one. First, let’s consider \nthe Western honeybee’s sting, Schmidt says it’s like “a flaming \nmatch head has landed on your arm and is quenched first with lye \nand then sulfuric acid.” This discomfort is accomplished with venom that’s packed with a pain-causing \npeptide called “melittin” and flesh-softening enzymes\nthat disperse the venom. These enzymes may also cause \nallergic reactions and even lead to fluid buildup \nin the lungs. Because worker honeybees have barbed \nstingers that burrow into certain victims, they usually can't sting without leaving\npart of their bodies behind, which ultimately kills them. Since only the queen bee has \nthe ability to reproduce, a worker bee’s self-sacrifice helps \nensure that the colony— and their genes— will prevail. But before they go, they release an alarm pheromone\nthat activates a mass attack and often targets some of the most \nvulnerable sites on their victim’s body. The tarantula hawk wasp sting is, \nas Schmidt says, “blinding, fierce, shockingly electric ...\nA bolt out of the heavens. Lie down and scream.” The sensation might last just 5\nagonizing minutes for humans, but it leaves tarantulas— the wasp’s\npreferred target— permanently paralyzed. After the wasp stings a tarantula, \naiming for a crucial bundle of nerves, it lays an egg on the immobilized spider. Once hatched, the wasp’s larva spends\nits formative days in the bountiful environment \nof the tarantula’s body— devouring it alive. Aside from paralyzing the tarantula, the wasp’s sting doesn’t seem\nto do further harm. This functions to preserve the spider \nas fresh meat for the wasp’s offspring. The rainforest-dwelling bullet ant’s sting\nyields “pure, intense, brilliant pain. Like walking over a flaming bed \nof charcoal with a 3-inch nail embedded \nin your heel,” according to Schmidt. And this torture\noften lasts more than 12 hours. A neurotoxic peptide called poneratoxin that our bodies struggle to degrade \nis what makes the pain last so long. In addition to agony, poneratoxin can \ninduce trembling, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, \nand even an abnormal heartbeat. The bullet ant is, in fact, crowned \nwith the most painful insect sting. It's thought that they may have evolved\nsuch an excruciating defense because they forage in rainforest canopies\nloaded with predators looking for proteinaceous snacks. They can’t simply jump or fly away, so perhaps they’re better off with this\nreliable, rather off-putting weapon. The tarantula hawk wasp’s formidable sting clocks in as the second most painful \non the scale. And it’s likely the reason this wasp \nhas no known predators. Honeybee stings are in the middle \nof the pain scale. But when many sting simultaneously, what might’ve felt manageable at first\nbecomes all the more dangerous. In fact, insect stings helped enable\nthe evolution of complex colonies that would otherwise represent\nan easy feast to predators. Some stinging insects are, of course,\nmore aggressive than others, but most of the time, they only sting us \nwhen we provoke them.

My daddy is the first person\nto have told me that I was beautiful. He often told me that he loved me, and he was one of my favorite\npeople in the entire world, which was why it was really challenging to discover that we had\na deep ideological divide that was so sincere and so deep that caused me to not talk\nto him for 10 years. Before the term was coined, I canceled my father. In the last few years, cancel culture has of course\ncome into great prominence. It's existed throughout time, but cancel culture in the bigger society is when a person in prominence\nsays or does something that we, the people, disagree with, and the decision is made\nto make them persona non grata. They are done. They are not to be revered. They are not to be\na part of our world anymore. And that is in the public realm. I'm going to talk to you today\nabout the private realm. When we choose to cancel\nthe people in our circle, the people in our core, the people who love us and who we love, and it has been mutually beneficial, but due to a deep\nand sincere ideological divide, we make the decision\nto cancel them out of our lives. I want to suggest that\ncancel culture needs to change, and instead we need to\nmove to compassion culture. But before I go there, let me tell you\ntwo of the premises that exist when we indulge in cancel culture. One, we have to believe that we're right. A hundred percent, no possibility of being wrong. And two, the other person, the person we're going to cancel, clearly does not have the ability to change, to grow, to develop. Obviously, both of these are problematic because sometimes we're not right. I don't know about you,\nbut there have been times in my life when I knew beyond\na shadow of a doubt that I was right only to discover that I was wrong, badly wrong, completely missed the mark. So if it could happen to me\nand perhaps it's happened to you, perhaps it could happen to others. The second is a little\neven more challenging because I know that\nI've changed over the years. Haven't we all? Though the core parts of Betty\nhave pretty much stayed the same, there have been key elements\nthat have changed drastically. The Betty of eight years old was\nnot the same as the Betty of 18, which was not the same as 28,\nwhich was not the same as 38. I've changed. And if I'm able to change, shouldn't I extend grace\nto believe that others can change too? So what should we do? Instead of canceling people,\nwe should use the tool called compassion. I find the definition of compassion\nis a fascinating one. And it's not one\nthat I hear people talk about. Compassion means to suffer with someone. To suffer alongside them. Imagine. When someone, say, Grandpa, says that thing\nthat's caused you to decide he's no longer invited to Thanksgiving, what if instead we chose\nto suffer alongside him? We decided that our love\nwas so big, so deep, so strong that we were willing to suffer, even when it could be potentially painful. Now let's be clear. I am not denying anyone's right\nto cancel anyone else. What I'm suggesting is that\nmaybe that's not the best way. When we think about the situation\nwith Grandpa at Thanksgiving, if we choose to cancel him, we are no longer in proximity to him. Not only do we not get to hear\nhis point of view, we don't get to share ours. What if we're the only person, because of our deep connection and love\nand affection for our grandfather -- and substitute anyone you choose. What if we're the ones\nto plant seeds of change, seeds of influence, seeds of difference. Now, to be fair, I cannot promise you\nthat just because you plant the seed, that it will get water, that it'll get any sunlight\nor even a little fertilizer. But what I can tell you\nis that if you don't plant it, who will? I find it interesting, this idea of suffering alongside someone. It means that we are choosing\nto value the totality of the person rather than one particular aspect, like a framework or a mindset\nor a belief system. We're choosing to believe\nthat the entire person is more valuable than any of the individual parts. And I found an amazing duo\nwho demonstrated this beautifully. Perhaps you've heard of them. The late justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia were close, close friends. And they were completely divided\nin terms of belief systems. In fact, Antonin Scalia once said, \"What's not to like,\nother than her thoughts on the law.\" He believed she was wrong. She believed he was wrong. They did not shift\nin that point of view whatsoever. And yet they had tea together every week, and every New Year's Eve, they spent it together\nwith their families. They went on family vacations together. They chose to suffer\nwith each other rather than to cancel each other. Their love and respect for each other continued to grow, even though they never saw eye to eye. I imagine that curiosity\nmight be a part of that. That if we choose to be curious\nabout that which is different, we might discover something along the way. After all, if we are who we are\nbecause of our lived experiences, isn't that true for someone else? And have we ever decided\nto use that tool of empathy, of walking a mile or so\nin someone else's shoes to really discover the context\nfor why they believe what they believe? Now, by now you're probably saying, \"Yeah, OK, Betty, this sounds good. But what about you? What about you and your dad?\" It's a fair question. After 10 years of not talking to my dad, I picked up the phone one day,\ncalled him and said, \"I bet if it were up to you, you'd probably go back in time\nand change some things. I know I would. But since we can't, how about we start again?\" And he said, \"Yes, because I love you. I always have. And I always will.\" I am so grateful that I made that call because there was no way for me to know that a few years later\nmy dad would develop Alzheimer's. And a few years after that he would die. And we never saw eye to eye\nabout the thing that divided us, ever. But our love continued. It continued through those 10 years\nwhen we didn't speak and it continued in the six years after. So I am encouraging us\nto become a society of people that choose compassion over canceling. I'm asking us to consider that curiosity might be a better practice. That we might choose empathy, that we might choose\nto have a love that is so deep, so wide, so strong that it can surpass differences. Why are we so scared\nof differences anyway? I also want us to be a people\nthat plant seeds, seeds of change, seeds of influence, seeds of diversity. Again, I cannot promise\nto you or anyone else that planting that seed\nis going to make a difference. But what if it does? I am the sum of who I am because of everything\nthat I've been exposed to. My mind has changed over the years and grown because of the people\nin my life who planted seeds in me, some that I saw and some that I didn't. So wouldn't it be great if instead of having a cancel culture we create a compassion culture where we are willing to suffer\nalongside the ones we love, because we love them. And can't we become\na community that plants seeds? After all, if we don't, who will? Thank you."}, "multiple-choice": []}
