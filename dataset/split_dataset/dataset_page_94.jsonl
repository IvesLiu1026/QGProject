Most of what we know about it\ncomes from fossils that look like this. So, is its coloration here \njust an artist's best guess? The answer is no. We know this shimmering \nblack color is accurate because paleontologists have analyzed\nclues contained within the fossil. But making sense of the evidence\nrequires careful examination of the fossil and a good understanding of the physics\nof light and color. First of all, here's what we actually see\non the fossil: imprints of bones and feathers that have\nleft telltale mineral deposits. And from those imprints, we can determine that these \nmicroraptor feathers were similar to modern dinosaur,\nas in bird, feathers. But what gives birds their signature\ndiverse colorations? Most feathers contain just one\nor two dye-like pigments. The cardinal's bright red\ncomes from carotenoids, the same pigments \nthat make carrots orange, while the black of its face\nis from melanin, the pigment that colors our hair and skin. But in bird feathers,\nmelanin isn't simply a dye. It forms hollow nanostructures\ncalled melanosomes which can shine in all the colors\nof the rainbow. To understand how that works, it helps to remember \nsome things about light. Light is basically a tiny electromagnetic\nwave traveling through space. The top of a wave is called its crest and the distance between two crests\nis called the wavelength. The crests in red light are about\n700 billionths of a meter apart and the wavelength of purple light\nis even shorter, about 400 billionths of a meter,\nor 400 nanometers. When light hits the thin front surface\nof a bird's hollow melanosome, some is reflected and some passes through. A portion of the transmitted light\nthen reflects off the back surface. The two reflected waves interact. Usually they cancel each other out, but when the wavelength\nof the reflected light matches the distance between\nthe two reflections, they reinforce each other. Green light has a wavelength\nof about 500 nanometers, so melanosomes that are \nabout 500 nanometers across give off green light, thinner melanosomes give off purple light, and thicker ones give off red light. Of course, it's more complex than this. The melanosomes are packed together\ninside cells, and other factors, like how the melanosomes are arranged \nwithin the feather, also matter. Let's return to the microraptor fossil. When scientists examined its feather \nimprints under a powerful microscope, they found nanostructures \nthat look like melanosomes. X-ray analysis of the melanosomes\nfurther supported that theory. They contained minerals that would\nresult from the decay of melanin. The scientists then chose 20 feathers\nfrom one fossil and found that \nthe melanosomes in all 20 looked alike, so they became pretty sure this dinosaur\nwas one solid color. They compared these microraptor\nmelanosomes to those of modern birds and found a close similarity,\nthough not a perfect match, to the iridescent teal feathers\nfound on duck wings. And by examining the exact size\nand arrangement of the melanosomes, scientists determined that the feathers\nwere iridescent black. Now that we can determine\na fossilized feather's color, paleontologists are looking for more\nfossils with well-preserved melanosomes. They've found that a lot of dinosaurs,\nincluding velociraptor, probably had feathers, meaning that certain films might not be\nso biologically accurate.

{"page": 94, "lesson": 2, "title": "The science of snowflakes - Maruša Bradač", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-of-snowflakes-marusa-bradac", "transcript": {"en": "If you ever find yourself \ngazing at falling snow, why not catch a few snowflakes \non your glove and examine their shapes? You might notice \nthat they look symmetrical, and if you look closely, you'll see they have six sides. You could say a snowflake \nis simply frozen water, but compare one \nwith an ice cube from the freezer, and you'll realize \nthey're very different things. Unlike ice cubes, formed when liquid\nfreezes into a solid, snowflakes form when water vapor\nturns straight into ice. But that still doesn't explain why\nsnowflakes have six sides. To understand that, we need to delve deeper \ninto the physics of water. Water is made out of two hydrogen atoms\nand one oxygen atom. A single water molecule \nthus has ten protons and ten electrons, eight from oxygen \nand one from each hydrogen atom. The two electrons \nfrom oxygen's outer shell are shared with two electrons\nfrom both hydrogens as they bond together, and the remaining \nfour outer shell electrons from oxygen form two pairs. We call the bonds between these atoms\ncovalent bonds. The pairs of electrons \nare all negatively charged. Similar charges repel, so they tend to stay as far away\nfrom each other as possible. The pairs form four electron clouds, two of which are where the hydrogen\nand oxygen share electrons. The repulsion between the unbonded pairs is even stronger than repulsion\nbetween the shared pairs, so the two hydrogens \nget pushed a little further to an angle of 104.5 degrees. The water molecule as a whole\nis electrically neutral, but oxygen gets \na larger share of electrons, making it slightly negative\nand the hydrogens slightly positive. Due to its negative charge, the oxygen in one molecule is attracted to the positive charge\nof the hydrogen in another molecule. And so a weak bond \nbetween the two molecules, called a hydrogen bond,\nis formed. When water freezes, this bonding\noccurs on repeat, ultimately forming a hexagonal structure due to the angle between hydrogens\nand oxygen within each molecule. This is the seed of a snowflake, and it retains a hexagonal shape\nas it grows. As the snowflake moves through the air, water vapor molecules \nstick to the six sharp edges and expand the snowflake outwards,\nbit by bit. A snowflake's developing shape depends\non atmospheric conditions, like humidity and temperature. As a snowflake falls, changes in weather conditions\ncan affect how it grows, and even small differences in the paths\ntwo snowflakes take will differentiate their shapes. However, since conditions at the six \nsharp edges of one snowflake are similar, a symmetric snowflake can grow. Weather conditions \naffect snow on the ground, as well. Warmer ground temperatures produce\na wetter snow that is easier to pack because liquid water molecules\nhelp snowflakes stick to each other. Melted snow also plays a critical role\nin another wintry activity, skiing. Completely dry snow \nis very difficult to ski on because there's too much friction between\nthe jagged snowflakes and the ski surface. So what's happening is that as skis move, they rub the surface of the snow\nand warm it up, creating a thin layer of water,\nwhich helps them slide along. So technically, \nit's not really snow skiing, but water skiing. But it is true that \nno matter how hard you look, you're almost definitely not going to find\ntwo identical snowflakes, and that's a mystery that scientists\nare still trying to solve, though we know that it has to do with the many possible \nbranching points in snowflake formation, and the differences \nin temperature and humidity, and while we wait for the answer, we can enjoy watching these tiny fractals\nfalling from the sky."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The hexgon properties of ice crystals are due to the polarity of the water molecule.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of the following describes a hydrogen bond?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The bond between hydrogen and oxygen within a molecule of water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The bond between two hydrogen atoms within a molecule of water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The bond between hydrogen in one water molecule and another hydrogen in a different water molecule"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The bond between hydrogen in one water molecule and oxygen in a different water molecule"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why are snowflakes six-sided?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Because liquid water boiled at lower temperatures at higher altitudes where snowflakes form"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Because dirt particles needed for snowflakes to form are six-sided"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because ice crystals are six-sided"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why can a skier slide over snow?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The friction between the ski and snow decreases when the skier steps on skis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The friction between the ski and snow increases when the skier steps on skis and causes snow to melt providing lubrication"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Because the skier took physics class and knows the physics of it"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The pressure between the ski and snow increases when the skier steps on skis and causes snow to melt providing lubrication"}, {"label": "E", "text": "The pressure between the ski and snow decreases when the skier steps on skis and causes snow to melt providing lubrication"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Covalent bonds result from:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The sharing of equal numbers of electrons by two atoms"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The exchange of equal numbers of electrons by two atoms"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The combination of two atoms of the same valence"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Sharing of unequal numbers of electrons by two atoms"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Soon you'll download your new clothes - Danit Peleg", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/forget-shopping-soon-you-ll-download-your-new-clothes-danit-peleg", "transcript": {"en": "In the past few months, I've been\ntraveling for weeks at a time with only one suitcase of clothes. One day, I was invited\nto an important event, and I wanted to wear\nsomething special and new for it. So I looked through my suitcase\nand I couldn't find anything to wear. I was lucky to be at the technology\nconference on that day, and I had access to 3D printers. So I quickly designed\na skirt on my computer, and I loaded the file on the printer. It just printed the pieces overnight. The next morning,\nI just took all the pieces, assembled them together in my hotel room, and this is actually the skirt\nthat I'm wearing right now. (Applause) So it wasn't the first time\nthat I printed clothes. For my senior collection\nat fashion design school, I decided to try and 3D print\nan entire fashion collection from my home. The problem was that I barely knew\nanything about 3D printing, and I had only nine months to figure out\nhow to print five fashionable looks. I always felt most creative\nwhen I worked from home. I loved experimenting with new materials, and I always tried\nto develop new techniques to make the most unique textiles\nfor my fashion projects. I loved going to old factories\nand weird stores in search of leftovers\nof strange powders and weird materials, and then bring them home to experiment on. As you can probably imagine, my roommates didn't like that at all. (Laughter) So I decided to move on\nto working with big machines, ones that didn't fit in my living room. I love the exact\nand the custom work I can do with all kinds of fashion technologies, like knitting machines\nand laser cutting and silk printing. One summer break, I came here\nto New York for an internship at a fashion house in Chinatown. We worked on two incredible dresses\nthat were 3D printed. They were amazing --\nlike you can see here. But I had a few issues with them. They were made from hard plastics\nand that's why they were very breakable. The models couldn't sit in them, and they even got scratched\nfrom the plastics under their arms. With 3D printing, the designers\nhad so much freedom to make the dresses look\nexactly like they wanted, but still, they were very dependent\non big and expensive industrial printers that were located in a lab\nfar from their studio. Later that year, a friend gave me\na 3D printed necklace, printed using a home printer. I knew that these printers\nwere much cheaper and much more accessible\nthan the ones we used at my internship. So I looked at the necklace, and then I thought, \"If I can\nprint a necklace from home, why not print my clothes from home, too?\" I really liked the idea that I wouldn't\nhave to go to the market and pick fabrics that\nsomeone else chose to sell -- I could just design them\nand print them directly from home. I found a small makerspace, where I learned everything\nI know about 3D printing. Right away, they literally\ngave me the key to the lab, so I could experiment\ninto the night, every night. The main challenge was to find the right\nfilament for printing clothes with. So what is a filament? Filament is the material\nyou feed the printer with. And I spent a month or so\nexperimenting with PLA, which is a hard and scratchy,\nbreakable material. The breakthrough came\nwhen I was introduced to Filaflex, which is a new kind of filament. It's strong, yet very flexible. And with it, I was able to print\nthe first garment, the red jacket that had\nthe word \"Liberté\" -- \"freedom\" in French -- embedded into it. I chose this word because I felt\nso empowered and free when I could just design\na garment from my home and then print it by myself. And actually, you can easily\ndownload this jacket, and easily change the word\nto something else. For example, your name\nor your sweetheart's name. (Laughter) So the printer plates are small, so I had to piece the garment\ntogether, just like a puzzle. And I wanted to solve another challenge. I wanted to print textiles that I would use\njust like regular fabrics. That's when I found an open-source file from an architect who designed\na pattern that I love. And with it, I was able to print\na beautiful textile that I would use\njust like a regular fabric. And it actually even looks\na little bit like lace. So I took his file and I modified it,\nand changed it, played with it -- many kinds of versions out of it. And I needed to print\nanother 1,500 more hours to complete printing my collection. So I brought six printers to my home\nand just printed 24-7. And this is actually\na really slow process, but let's remember the Internet\nwas significantly slower 20 years ago, so 3D printing will also accelerate and in no time you'll be able to print\na T-Shirt in your home in just a couple of hours,\nor even minutes. So you guys, you want to see\nwhat it looks like? Audience: Yeah! (Applause) Danit Peleg: Rebecca is wearing\none of my five outfits. Almost everything here she's wearing,\nI printed from my home. Even her shoes are printed. Audience: Wow! Audience: Cool! (Applause) Danit Peleg: Thank you, Rebecca. (To audience) Thank you, guys. So I think in the future,\nmaterials will evolve, and they will look and feel\nlike fabrics we know today, like cotton or silk. Imagine personalized clothes\nthat fit exactly to your measurements. Music was once a very physical thing. You would have to go\nto the record shop and buy CDs, but now you can just download the music -- digital music -- directly to your phone. Fashion is also a very physical thing. And I wonder what our world will look like when our clothes will be digital,\njust like this skirt is. Thank you so much.

{"page": 94, "lesson": 4, "title": "Why do we dream? - Amy Adkins", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-we-dream-amy-adkins", "transcript": {"en": "In the third millenium BCE, Mesopotamian kings recorded and\ninterpreted their dreams on wax tablets. A thousand years later, Ancient Egyptians wrote a dream book listing over a hundred common dreams\nand their meanings. And in the years since, we haven't paused in our quest\nto understand why we dream. So, after a great deal\nof scientific research, technological advancement, and persistence, we still don't have any definite answers,\nbut we have some interesting theories. We dream to fulfill our wishes. In the early 1900s, Sigmund Freud proposed that while all\nof our dreams, including our nightmares, are a collection of images\nfrom our daily conscious lives, they also have symbolic meanings, which relate to the fulfillment\nof our subconscious wishes. Freud theorized that everything \nwe remember when we wake up from a dream is a symbolic representation of our unconscious primitive thoughts,\nurges, and desires. Freud believed that by analyzing\nthose remembered elements, the unconscious content would be revealed\nto our conscious mind, and psychological issues stemming\nfrom its repression could be addressed and resolved. We dream to remember. To increase performance \non certain mental tasks, sleep is good, but dreaming while sleeping is better. In 2010, researchers found that subjects were much better \nat getting through a complex 3-D maze if they had napped and dreamed\nof the maze prior to their second attempt. In fact, they were up to \nten times better at it than those who only thought of the maze\nwhile awake between attempts, and those who napped but did not dream\nabout the maze. Researchers theorize that certain\nmemory processes can happen only when we are asleep, and our dreams are a signal\nthat these processes are taking place. We dream to forget. There are about 10,000 trillion \nneural connections within the architecture of your brain. They are created by everything you think\nand everything you do. A 1983 neurobiological theory of dreaming,\ncalled reverse learning, holds that while sleeping,\nand mainly during REM sleep cycles, your neocortex reviews \nthese neural connections and dumps the unnecessary ones. Without this unlearning process, which results in your dreams, your brain could be overrun \nby useless connections and parasitic thoughts could disrupt\nthe necessary thinking you need to do while you're awake. We dream to keep our brains working. The continual activation theory proposes\nthat your dreams result from your brain's need to constantly\nconsolidate and create long-term memories in order to function properly. So when external input falls\nbelow a certain level, like when you're asleep, your brain automatically triggers the generation of data \nfrom its memory storages, which appear to you in the form of\nthe thoughts and feelings you experience in your dreams. In other words, your dreams might be\na random screen saver your brain turns on so it doesn't completely shut down. We dream to rehearse. Dreams involving dangerous and threatening\nsituations are very common, and the primitive instinct \nrehearsal theory holds that the content of a dream\nis significant to its purpose. Whether it's an anxiety-filled night of\nbeing chased through the woods by a bear or fighting off a ninja in a dark alley, these dreams allow you to practice\nyour fight or flight instincts and keep them sharp and dependable\nin case you'll need them in real life. But it doesn't always have \nto be unpleasant. For instance, dreams \nabout your attractive neighbor could actually give your reproductive\ninstinct some practice, too. We dream to heal. Stress neurotransmitters in the brain\nare much less active during the REM stage of sleep, even during dreams \nof traumatic experiences, leading some researchers to theorize that one purpose of dreaming is to take\nthe edge off painful experiences to allow for psychological healing. Reviewing traumatic events\nin your dreams with less mental stress may grant you a clearer perspective and enhanced ability to process them\nin psychologically healthy ways. People with certain mood disorders\nand PTSD often have difficulty sleeping, leading some scientists to believe\nthat lack of dreaming may be a contributing factor\nto their illnesses. We dream to solve problems. Unconstrained by reality\nand the rules of conventional logic, in your dreams, your mind can create\nlimitless scenarios to help you grasp problems and formulate solutions\nthat you may not consider while awake. John Steinbeck called it \nthe committee of sleep, and research has demonstrated the effectiveness of dreaming \non problem solving. It's also how renowned chemist \nAugust Kekule discovered the structure \nof the benzene molecule, and it's the reason that sometimes \nthe best solution for a problem is to sleep on it. And those are just a few of the more\nprominent theories. As technology increases our capability\nfor understanding the brain, it's possible that one day we will discover \nthe definitive reason for them. But until that time arrives,\nwe'll just have to keep on dreaming."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Humans have discovered the definitive reason that we have dreams.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Known as The Father of Psychoanalysis, this doctor's theory of dreaming holds that the images in our dreams have symbolic meanings which relate to our subconscious wishes.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Carl Jung"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Wilhelm Reich"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sigmund Freud"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hermann Rorschach"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Alfred Adler"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The \"Continuation Activation Theory\" of dreams holds that you dream in order to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Keep your brain active when sensory input is low"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Figure out difficult problems from the day before"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All of the above"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Remember important things in the morning"}, {"label": "E", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Keeping your fight or flight instincts sharp is one of the reasons we dream, according to which theory?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Continual Activation Theory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Primitive Instinct Rehearsal Theory"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Reverse Learning Theory"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}, {"label": "E", "text": "The Committee of Sleep Theory"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "According to the results of one research study, a person will be able to get through a 3D virtual maze the fastest on their second attempt at it if they:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Take a nap but don't dream anything between their first and second attempts at getting through the 3D maze"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Think very hard about the 3D maze between their first and second attempts at getting through it"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Think of something entirely different between their first and secodn attempts at getting through the 3D maze"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Take a nap and dream about the 3D maze between the first and second attempt at getting through it"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Try harder the second time around"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
{"page": 94, "lesson": 5, "title": "The ethical dilemma of self-driving cars - Patrick Lin", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-ethical-dilemma-of-self-driving-cars-patrick-lin", "transcript": {"en": "This is a thought experiment. Let's say at some point\nin the not so distant future, you're barreling down the highway\nin your self-driving car, and you find yourself boxed in\non all sides by other cars. Suddenly, a large, heavy object\nfalls off the truck in front of you. Your car can't stop in time\nto avoid the collision, so it needs to make a decision: go straight and hit the object, swerve left into an SUV, or swerve right into a motorcycle. Should it prioritize your safety\nby hitting the motorcycle, minimize danger to others by not swerving, even if it means hitting the large object\nand sacrificing your life, or take the middle ground\nby hitting the SUV, which has a high passenger safety rating? So what should the self-driving car do? If we were driving that boxed in car\nin manual mode, whichever way we'd react\nwould be understood as just that, a reaction, not a deliberate decision. It would be an instinctual panicked move\nwith no forethought or malice. But if a programmer were to instruct\nthe car to make the same move, given conditions it may \nsense in the future, well, that looks more\nlike premeditated homicide. Now, to be fair, self-driving cars are predicted \nto dramatically reduce traffic accidents and fatalities by removing human error \nfrom the driving equation. Plus, there may be all sorts \nof other benefits: eased road congestion, decreased harmful emissions, and minimized unproductive\nand stressful driving time. But accidents can and will still happen, and when they do, their outcomes may be determined\nmonths or years in advance by programmers or policy makers. And they'll have \nsome difficult decisions to make. It's tempting to offer up general \ndecision-making principles, like minimize harm, but even that quickly leads \nto morally murky decisions. For example, let's say we have the same initial set up, but now there's a motorcyclist \nwearing a helmet to your left and another one without \na helmet to your right. Which one should \nyour robot car crash into? If you say the biker with the helmet\nbecause she's more likely to survive, then aren't you penalizing \nthe responsible motorist? If, instead, you save the biker \nwithout the helmet because he's acting irresponsibly, then you've gone way beyond the initial\ndesign principle about minimizing harm, and the robot car is now \nmeting out street justice. The ethical considerations \nget more complicated here. In both of our scenarios, the underlying design is functioning\nas a targeting algorithm of sorts. In other words, it's systematically favoring \nor discriminating against a certain type \nof object to crash into. And the owners of the target vehicles will suffer the negative consequences\nof this algorithm through no fault of their own. Our new technologies are opening up\nmany other novel ethical dilemmas. For instance, if you had to \nchoose between a car that would always save\nas many lives as possible in an accident, or one that would save you at any cost, which would you buy? What happens if the cars start analyzing\nand factoring in the passengers of the cars\nand the particulars of their lives? Could it be the case \nthat a random decision is still better than a predetermined one\ndesigned to minimize harm? And who should be making \nall of these decisions anyhow? Programmers?

If you were given the choice to sign up\nfor that kind of existence, would you? That's the question philosopher \nRobert Nozick posed through a thought experiment\nhe called the Experience Machine. The experiment asks us \nto consider a world in which scientists have developed \na machine that would simulate real life while guaranteeing experiences\nof only pleasure and never pain. The catch? You have to permanently\nleave reality behind, but you'll hardly know the difference. Your experiences will be \nindistinguishable from reality. Life's natural ups and downs will just be replaced \nwith an endless series of ups. Sounds great, right? It may seem like a tempting offer,\nbut perhaps it's not as ideal as it sounds. The experiment was actually designed\nto refute a philosophical notion called hedonism. According to hedonists, maximizing net pleasure \nis the most important thing in life because pleasure is the greatest good\nthat life has to offer. For hedonists, the best choice that\na person could make for himself is one that brings him the greatest\npossible amount of pleasure while bringing him no pain. Limitless pleasure minus zero pain\nequals maximum net pleasure, or in other words, the exact scenario\nthe Experience Machine offers. Therefore, if hedonism \nis your philosophy of choice, plugging in would be a no-brainer. But what if there's more to life\nthan just pleasure? That's what Nozick believed\nhe was demonstrating through his Experience Machine \nthought experiment. Despite the machine's promise\nof maximum net pleasure, he still found reason not to plug in, as do many other experimenters\nwho consider the proposition. But what could possibly dissuade us from\nchoosing a future of ultimate pleasure? Consider this scenario. Betsy and Xander are in a loving,\ncommitted relationship. Betsy is head over heels\nand has never felt happier. However, unbeknownst to Betsy, Xander has been romancing\nher sister, Angelica, with love letters and secret rendezvous\nfor the duration of their relationship. If Betsy found out, it would destroy her relationships \nwith both Xander and Angelica, and the experience would be so traumatic,\nshe would never love again. Since Betsy is in blissful ignorance\nabout Xander's infidelity, hedonists would say she's better off\nremaining in the dark and maintaining her high level\nof net pleasure. As long as Betsy never finds out\nabout the relationship, her life is guaranteed to go on\nas happily as it is right now. So, is there value in Besty knowing\nthe truth of her situation? Imagine if you were Betsy. Would you prefer to know the truth? If the answer is yes, you'd be choosing an option\nthat sharply decreases your net pleasure. Perhaps, then, you believe\nthat there are things in life with greater intrinsic value\nthan pleasure. Truth, knowledge, authentic connection\nwith other human beings. These are all things \nthat might make the list. By never learning the truth, Betsy is essentially living life\nin her own personal Experience Machine, a world of happiness \nthat's not based in reality. This love triangle is an extreme example, but it mirrors many of the decisions\nwe make in day to day life. So whether you're making a choice\nfor Betsy or for yourself, why might you feel reality\nshould be a factor? Is there inherent value \nin real experiences, whether pleasurable or painful? Do you yourself have more value when you're experiencing \nreal life's pleasures and pains? Nozick's experiment may not provide\nall the answers, but it forces us to consider whether\nreal life, though imperfect, holds some intrinsic value \nbeyond the pleasure of plugging in."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which philosopher posed the Experience Machine thought experiment?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Plato"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thomas Hobbes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Robert Nozick"}, {"label": "D", "text": "John Locke"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "According to hedonism, what is the ultimate \"good\" in life?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pleasure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Knowledge"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Friendship"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Altruism"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In the example of Betsy, Xander and Angelica, hedonists would say that Betsy should:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Learn the truth and stay with Xander"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Learn the truth and leave Xander"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Not learn the truth and leave Xander"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Not learn the truth and stay with Xander"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Plugging into the Experience Machine would provide users with:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Immortality"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Powers of invisibility"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ultimate pleasure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Omniscience"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Life inside the Experience Machine would feel like:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Real life"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A video game"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A dream"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A nightmare"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

To be entertained, to find out who done it, to travel to strange, new planets, to be scared, to laugh, to cry, to think, to feel, to be so absorbed that for a while\nwe forget where we are. So, how about writing fiction? How do you suck your readers\ninto your stories? With an exciting plot? Maybe. Fascinating characters? Probably. Beautiful language? Perhaps. \"Billie's legs are noodles. The ends of\nher hair are poison needles. Her tongue is a bristly sponge,\nand her eyes are bags of bleach.\" Did that description almost make you feel\nas queasy as Billie? We grasp that Billie's legs \naren't actually noodles. To Billie, they feel \nas limp as cooked noodles. It's an implied comparison, a metaphor. So, why not simply write it like this? \"Billie feels nauseated and weak.\" Chances are the second description\nwasn't as vivid to you as the first. The point of fiction is to cast a spell, a momentary illusion that you are living\nin the world of the story. Fiction engages the senses, helps us create vivid mental simulacra of the experiences \nthe characters are having. Stage and screen engage \nsome of our senses directly. We see and hear the interactions\nof the characters and the setting. But with prose fiction, all you have is static symbols\non a contrasting background. If you describe the story\nin matter of fact, non-tactile language, the spell risks being a weak one. Your reader may not get much beyond\ninterpreting the squiggles. She will understand \nwhat Billie feels like, but she won't feel what Billie feels. She'll be reading, not immersed\nin the world of the story, discovering the truths of Billie's life\nat the same time that Billie herself does. Fiction plays with our senses: taste, smell, touch, hearing, sight, and the sense of motion. It also plays with our ability to abstract\nand make complex associations. Look at the following sentence. \"The world was ghost-quiet, except for the crack of sails\nand the burbling of water against hull.\" The words, \"quiet,\" \"crack,\" \nand \"burbling,\" engage the sense of hearing. Notice that Buckell doesn't use\nthe generic word sound. Each word he chooses evokes \na particular quality of sound. Then, like an artist laying \non washes of color to give the sense \nof texture to a painting, he adds anoter layer, motion,\n\"the crack of sails,\" and touch, \n\"the burbling of water against hull.\" Finally, he gives us \nan abstract connection by linking the word quiet\nwith the word ghost. Not \"quiet as a ghost,\" which would put \na distancing layer of simile between the reader and the experience. Instead, Buckell creates \nthe metaphor \"ghost-quiet\" for an implied, \nrather than overt, comparison. Writers are always told to avoid cliches because there's very little engagement\nfor the reader in an overused image, such as \"red as a rose.\" But give them, \"Love...began on a beach. It began that day when Jacob saw Anette\nin her stewed-cherry dress,\" and their brains engage \nin the absorbing task of figuring out what \na stewed-cherry dress is like. Suddenly, they're on a beach\nabout to fall in love. They're experiencing the story\nat both a visceral and a conceptual level, meeting the writer halfway\nin the imaginative play of creating a dynamic world\nof the senses. So when you write, \nuse well-chosen words to engage sound, sight, taste,\ntouch, smell, and movement.

That's 11 days to see how\nhe'd cope without sleep. On the second day, \nhis eyes stopped focusing. Next, he lost the ability\nto identify objects by touch. By day three, Gardner was moody\nand uncoordinated. At the end of the experiment,\nhe was struggling to concentrate, had trouble with short-term memory, became paranoid, and started hallucinating. Although Gardner recovered without\nlong-term psychological or physical damage, for others, losing shuteye can result\nin hormonal imbalance, illness, and, in extreme cases, death. We're only beginning to understand\nwhy we sleep to begin with, but we do know it's essential. Adults need seven to eight hours\nof sleep a night, and adolescents need about ten. We grow sleepy due to signals\nfrom our body telling our brain we are tired, and signals from the environment\ntelling us it's dark outside. The rise in sleep-inducing chemicals, like adenosine and melatonin, send us into a light doze \nthat grows deeper, making our breathing \nand heart rate slow down and our muscles relax. This non-REM sleep is when DNA is repaired and our bodies replenish themselves\nfor the day ahead. In the United States, it's estimated that 30% of adults\nand 66% of adolescents are regularly sleep-deprived. This isn't just a minor inconvenience. Staying awake can cause \nserious bodily harm. When we lose sleep, learning, memory, mood, and reaction time are affected. Sleeplessness may also cause inflammation, halluciations, high blood pressure, and it's even been linked\nto diabetes and obesity. In 2014, a devoted soccer fan died after staying awake for 48 hours \nto watch the World Cup. While his untimely death \nwas due to a stroke, studies show that chronically sleeping\nfewer than six hours a night increases stroke risk \nby four and half times compared to those getting a consistent\nseven to eight hours of shuteye. For a handful of people on the planet who\ncarry a rare inherited genetic mutation, sleeplessness is a daily reality. This condition, \nknown as Fatal Familial Insomnia, places the body in a nightmarish \nstate of wakefulness, forbidding it from entering \nthe sanctuary of sleep. Within months or years, this progressively worsening condition\nleads to dementia and death. How can sleep deprivation\ncause such immense suffering? Scientists think the answer lies\nwith the accumulation of waste prducts in the brain. During our waking hours, our cells are busy using up\nour day's energy sources, which get broken down \ninto various byproducts, including adenosine. As adenosine builds up, it increases the urge to sleep,\nalso known as sleep pressure. In fact, caffeine works by blocking\nadenosine's receptor pathways. Other waste products \nalso build up in the brain, and if they're not cleared away,\nthey collectively overload the brain and are thought to lead to the many\nnegative symptoms of sleep deprivation. So, what's happening in our brain\nwhen we sleep to prevent this? Scientists found something called\nthe glymphatic system, a clean-up mechanism \nthat removes this buildup and is much more active when we're asleep. It works by using cerebrospinal fluid\nto flush away toxic byproducts that accumulate between cells. Lymphatic vessels, \nwhich serve as pathways for immune cells, have recently been discovered \nin the brain, and they may also play a role in clearing\nout the brain's daily waste products.

We have over 600 of them. They make up between \n1/3 and 1/2 of our body weight, and along with connective tissue, they bind us together, hold us up,\nand help us move. And whether or not body building\nis your hobby, muscles need your constant attention because the way you treat \nthem on a daily basis determines whether \nthey will wither or grow. Say you're standing in front of a door,\nready to pull it open. Your brain and muscles are perfectly\npoised to help you achieve this goal. First, your brain sends a signal\nto motor neurons inside your arm. When they receive this message,\nthey fire, causing muscles to contract and relax, which pull on the bones in your arm\nand generate the needed movement. The bigger the challenge becomes,\nthe bigger the brain's signal grows, and the more motor units it rallies\nto help you achieve your task. But what if the door \nis made of solid iron? At this point, your arm muscles alone won't be able to generate \nenough tension to pull it open, so your brain appeals \nto other muscles for help. You plant your feet, tighten your belly,\nand tense your back, generating enough force to yank it open. Your nervous system has just leveraged\nthe resources you already have, other muscles, to meet the demand. While all this is happening, your muscle fibers undergo \nanother kind of cellular change. As you expose them to stress,\nthey experience microscopic damage, which, in this context, is a good thing. In response, the injured cells release\ninflammatory molecules called cytokines that activate the immune system\nto repair the injury. This is when the muscle-building \nmagic happens. The greater the damage \nto the muscle tissue, the more your body \nwill need to repair itself. The resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles \nbigger and stronger as they adapt to progressively \ngreater demands. Since our bodies have already adapted\nto most everyday activities, those generally don't produce \nenough stress to stimulate new muscle growth. So, to build new muscle,\na process called hypertrophy, our cells need to be exposed to higher\nworkloads than they are used to. In fact, if you don't continuously expose\nyour muscles to some resistance, they will shrink, a process known as muscular atrophy. In contrast, exposing the muscle\nto a high-degree of tension, especially while \nthe muscle is lengthening, also called an eccentric contraction, generates effective conditions\nfor new growth. However, muscles rely on more than\njust activity to grow. Without proper nutrition, \nhormones, and rest, your body would never be able\nto repair damaged muscle fibers. Protein in our diet preserves muscle mass by providing the building \nblocks for new tissue in the form of amino acids. Adequate protein intake,\nalong with naturally occurring hormones, like insulin-like growth factor\nand testosterone, help shift the body into a state\nwhere tissue is repaired and grown. This vital repair process mainly occurs\nwhen we're resting, especially at night while sleeping. Gender and age \naffect this repair mechanism, which is why young men \nwith more testosterone have a leg up in the muscle building game. Genetic factors also play a role\nin one's ability to grow muscle. Some people have more robust \nimmune reactions to muscle damage, and are better able to repair\nand replace damaged muscle fibers, increasing their \nmuscle-building potential. The body responds to the demands\nyou place on it. If you tear your muscles up,\neat right, rest and repeat, you'll create the conditions to make your\nmuscles as big and strong as possible.

Van Norden", "category": "Philosophy", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/who-was-confucius-bryan-w-van-norden", "transcript": {"en": "Most people recognize his name and know that he is famous \nfor having said something, but considering the long-lasting impact\nhis teachings have had on the world, very few people know \nwho Confucius really was, what he really said, and why. Amid the chaos of 6th Century BCE China, where warring states fought \nendlessly among themselves for supremacy, and rulers were frequently assassinated, sometimes by their own relatives, Confucius exemplified benevolence\nand integrity, and through his teaching, became one of China's \ngreatest philosophers. Born to a nobleman but raised in poverty\nfrom a very young age following the untimely \ndeath of his father, Confucius developed what would become a lifelong sympathy\nfor the suffering of the common people. Barely supporting his mother\nand disabled brother as a herder \nand account keeper at a granary, and with other odd jobs, it was only with \nthe help of a wealthy friend that Confucius was able \nto study at the Royal Archives, where his world view would be formed. Though the ancient texts there\nwere regarded by some as irrelevant relics of the past, Confucius was inspired by them. Through study and reflection, Confucius came to believe that \nhuman character is formed in the family and by education in ritual, \nliterature, and history. A person cultivated in this way\nworks to help others, guiding them by moral inspiration\nrather than brute force. To put his philosophy into practice, Confucius became an advisor to the ruler\nof his home state of Lu. But after another state sent Lu's ruler\na troop of dancing girls as a present and the ruler ignored his duties\nwhile enjoying the girls in private, Confucius resigned in disgust. He then spent the next few years\ntraveling from state to state, trying to find a worthy ruler to serve,\nwhile holding fast to his principles. It wasn't easy. In accordance with his philosophy,\nand contrary to the practice of the time, Confucius dissuaded rulers from relying\non harsh punishments and military power to govern their lands because he believed that a good ruler inspires others \nto spontaneously follow him by virtue of his ethical charisma. Confucius also believed that because the love and respect\nwe learn in the family are fundamental to all other virtues, personal duties to family sometimes\nsupersede obligations to the state. So when one duke bragged \nthat his subjects were so upright that a son testified \nagainst his own father when his father stole a sheep, Confucius informed the duke that genuinely upright fathers \nand sons protected one another. During his travels, \nConfucius almost starved, he was briefly imprisoned, and his life was threatened \nat several points. But he was not bitter. Confucius had faith that heaven\nhad a plan for the world, and he taught that a virtuous person could always find joy \nin learning and music.

Trying to get more done\nthan you have time to do? Stress is a feeling we all experience\nwhen we are challenged or overwhelmed. But more than just an emotion, stress is a hardwired physical response\nthat travels throughout your entire body. In the short term, \nstress can be advantageous, but when activated too often or too long, your primitive fight or flight \nstress response not only changes your brain but also damages many of the other\norgans and cells throughout your body. Your adrenal gland releases \nthe stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, \nalso known as adrenaline, and norepinephrine. As these hormones \ntravel through your blood stream, they easily reach \nyour blood vessels and heart. Adrenaline causes \nyour heart to beat faster and raises your blood pressure,\nover time causing hypertension. Cortisol can also cause the endothelium,\nor inner lining of blood vessels, to not function normally. Scientists now know \nthat this is an early step in triggering the process \nof atherosclerosis or cholesterol plaque\nbuild up in your arteries. Together, these changes increase \nyour chances of a heart attack or stroke. When your brain senses stress, it activates your \nautonomic nervous system. Through this network \nof nerve connections, your big brain communicates\nstress to your enteric, or intestinal nervous system. Besides causing butterflies \nin your stomach, this brain-gut connection can disturb\nthe natural rhythmic contractions that move food through your gut, leading to irritable bowel syndrome, and can increase your \ngut sensitivity to acid, making you more likely to feel heartburn. Via the gut's nervous system, stress can also change the composition\nand function of your gut bacteria, which may affect your digestive\nand overall health. Speaking of digestion, does chronic\nstress affect your waistline? Well, yes. Cortisol can increase your appetite. It tells your body to replenish \nyour energy stores with energy dense foods and carbs,\ncausing you to crave comfort foods. High levels of cortisol can also cause you\nto put on those extra calories as visceral or deep belly fat. This type of fat doesn't just make\nit harder to button your pants. It is an organ \nthat actively releases hormones and immune system chemicals \ncalled cytokines that can increase your risk\nof developing chronic diseases, such as heart disease \nand insulin resistance. Meanwhile, stress hormones \naffect immune cells in a variety of ways. Initially, they help prepare \nto fight invaders and heal after injury, but chronic stress can dampen function\nof some immune cells, make you more susceptible to infections,\nand slow the rate you heal. Want to live a long life? You may have to curb your chronic stress. That's because it has even been\nassociated with shortened telomeres, the shoelace tip ends of chromosomes\nthat measure a cell's age. Telomeres cap chromosomes to allow DNA to get copied\nevery time a cell divides without damaging \nthe cell's genetic code, and they shorten with each cell division. When telomeres become too short,\na cell can no longer divide and it dies. As if all that weren't enough, chronic stress has even more ways\nit can sabotage your health, including acne, hair loss, sexual dysfunction, headaches, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, and irritability. So, what does all this mean for you? Your life will always be filled\nwith stressful situations. But what matters to your brain\nand entire body is how you respond to that stress.

Human rights are not privileges, and they cannot be granted or revoked. They are inalienable and universal. That may sound straighforward enough, but it gets incredibly complicated as soon as anyone tries \nto put the idea into practice. What exactly are the basic human rights? Who gets to pick them? Who enforces them, and how? The history behind \nthe concept of human rights is a long one. Throughout the centuries and across\nsocieties, religions, and cultures we have struggled with defining notions\nof rightfulness, justice, and rights. But one of the most modern affirmations\nof universal human rights emerged from the ruins of World War II\nwith the creation of the United Nations. The treaty that established the UN\ngives as one of its purposes to reaffirm faith in \nfundamental human rights. And with the same spirit, in 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This document, written by an international\ncommittee chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, lays the basis for modern \ninternational human rights law. The declaration is based on the principle that all human beings are born\nfree and equal in dignity and rights. It lists 30 articles recognizing,\namong other things, the principle of nondiscrimination\nand the right to life and liberty. It refers to negative freedoms,\nlike the freedom from torture or slavery, as well as positive freedoms, such as the freedom \nof movement and residence. It encompasses basic civil\nand political rights, such as freedom of expression, religion,\nor peaceful assembly, as well as social, economic,\nand cultural rights, such as the right to education and the right to freely \nchoose one's occupation and be paid and treated fairly. The declaration takes no sides\nas to which rights are more important, insisting on their universality, indivisibility, and interdependence. And in the past decades,\ninternational human rights law has grown, deepening and expanding our understanding\nof what human rights are, and how to better protect them. So if these principles \nare so well-developed, then why are human rights abused\nand ignored time and time again all over the world? The problem in general\nis that it is not at all easy to universally enforce these rights\nor to punish transgressors. The UDHR itself, despite being\nhighly authoritative and respected, is a declaration, not a hard law. So when individual countries violate it, the mechanisms to address \nthose violations are weak. For example, the main bodies within the UN\nin charge of protecting human rights mostly monitor and investigate violations, but they cannot force states to, say,\nchange a policy or compensate a victim. That's why some critics say it's naive\nto consider human rights a given in a world where state interests \nwield so much power. Critics also question the universality\nof human rights and emphasize that their development has been heavily guided by a small number\nof mostly Western nations to the detriment of inclusiveness. The result? A general bias in favor \nof civil policital liberties over sociopolitical rights and of individual \nover collective or groups rights. Others defend universal human rights laws and point at the positive role they have\non setting international standards and helping activists in their campaigns. They also point out that not all international \nhuman rights instruments are powerless. For example, the European Convention\non Human Rights establishes a court where the 47 member countries\nand their citizens can bring cases. The court issues binding decisions\nthat each member state must comply with. Human rights law is constantly evolving as are our views and definitions of what\nthe basic human rights should be.

They wanted to transform lowly lead\ninto gleaming gold. History portrays these people\nas aged eccentrics, but if only they'd known that their\ndreams were actually achievable. Indeed, today we can \nmanufacture gold on Earth thanks to modern inventions that those medieval alchemists\nmissed by a few centuries. But to understand how this precious metal became embedded \nin our planet to start with, we have to gaze upwards at the stars. Gold is extraterrestrial. Instead of arising \nfrom the planet's rocky crust, it was actually cooked up in space and is present on Earth \nbecause of cataclysmic stellar explosions called supernovae. Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen,\nthe simplest and lightest element. The enormous gravitational pressure\nof so much material compresses and triggers nuclear fusion\nin the star's core. This process releases energy\nfrom the hydrogen, making the star shine. Over many millions of years, fusion transforms hydrogen \ninto heavier elements: helium, carbon, and oxygen, burning subsequent elements faster\nand faster to reach iron and nickel. However, at that point nuclear fusion\nno longer releases enough energy, and the pressure from the core peters out. The outer layers collapse into the center, and bouncing back from this sudden\ninjection of energy, the star explodes forming a supernova. The extreme pressure\nof a collapsing star is so high, that subatomic protons and electrons\nare forced together in the core, forming neutrons. Neutrons have no repelling electric charge so they're easily captured \nby the iron group elements. Multiple neutron captures enable\nthe formation of heavier elements that a star under \nnormal circumstances can't form, from silver to gold, past lead and on to uranium. In extreme contrast to the million year\ntransformation of hydrogen to helium, the creation of the heaviest \nelements in a supernova takes place in only seconds. But what becomes of the gold\nafter the explosion? The expanding supernova shockwave\npropels its elemental debris through the interstellar medium, triggering a swirling dance \nof gas and dust that condenses into new stars and planets. Earth's gold was likely delivered this way before being kneaded into veins\nby geothermal activity. Billions of years later, we now extract\nthis precious product by mining it, an expensive process that's compounded\nby gold's rarity. In fact, all of the gold \nthat we've mined in history could be piled into \njust three Olympic-size swimming pools, although this represents a lot of mass because gold is about 20 times \ndenser than water. So, can we produce more \nof this coveted commodity? Actually, yes. Using particle accelerators, we can mimic\nthe complex nuclear reactions that create gold in stars. But these machines can only construct gold\natom by atom. So it would take almost the age \nof the universe to produce one gram at a cost vastly exceeding \nthe current value of gold. So that's not a very good solution. But if we were to reach \na hypothetical point where we'd mined \nall of the Earth's buried gold, there are other places we could look. The ocean holds an estimated \n20 million tons of dissolved gold but at extremely miniscule concentrations\nmaking its recovery too costly at present. Perhaps one day, we'll see gold rushes\nto tap the mineral wealth of the other planets of our solar system. And who knows? Maybe some future supernova \nwill occur close enough to shower us with its treasure and hopefully not eradicate \nall life on Earth in the process."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the lightest chemical element?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gold"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Water"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Helium"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hydrogen"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How are the lightest elements made?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nuclear fusion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chemical fusion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Electron capture"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neutron capture"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How are the heaviest elements made?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Nuclear fusion"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Chemical fusion"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Proton capture"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Neutron capture"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How long does a supernova take to make gold?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A few seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A few days"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A few years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The age of the Universe"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How long would it take to make a gram of gold with a particle accelerator?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A few seconds"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A few days"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A few years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The age of the Universe"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

The aliens think humans look quite tasty, but their civilization forbids eating\nhighly logical and cooperative beings. Unfortunately, they're not sure \nwhether you qualify, so they decide to give you all a test. Through its universal translator, the alien guarding you \ntells you the following: You will be placed in a single-file line\nfacing forward in size order so that each of you can see \neveryone lined up ahead of you. You will not be able to look behind you\nor step out of line. Each of you will have either a black\nor a white hat on your head assigned randomly, and I won't tell you \nhow many of each color there are. When I say to begin, each of you must\nguess the color of your hat starting with the person in the back\nand moving up the line. And don't even try saying words\nother than black or white or signaling some other way,\nlike intonation or volume; you'll all be eaten immediately.

Can you think of a strategy guaranteed\nto save everyone? Pause the video now \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The key is that the person \nat the back of the line who can see everyone else's hats\ncan use the words \"black\" or \"white\" to communicate some coded information. So what meaning can be \nassigned to those words that will allow everyone else \nto deduce their hat colors? It can't be the total number\nof black or white hats. There are more than two possible values, but what does have two possible values\nis that number's parity, that is whether it's odd or even. So the solution is to agree\nthat whoever goes first will, for example, say \"black\" if he sees\nan odd number of black hats and \"white\" if he sees \nan even number of black hats. Let's see how it would play out\nif the hats were distributed like this. The tallest captive sees three black\nhats in front of him, so he says \"black,\" telling everyone else\nhe sees an odd number of black hats. He gets his own hat color wrong,\nbut that's okay since you're collectively allowed \nto have one wrong answer. Prisoner two also sees an odd\nnumber of black hats, so she knows hers is white,\nand answers correctly. Prisoner three sees \nan even number of black hats, so he knows that his must be \none of the black hats the first two prisoners saw. Prisoner four hears that and knows that she should be looking for \nan even number of black hats since one was behind her. But she only sees one, so she deduces\nthat her hat is also black. Prisoners five through nine are each\nlooking for an odd number of black hats, which they see, so they figure out\nthat their hats are white. Now it all comes down to you\nat the front of the line. If the ninth prisoner saw \nan odd number of black hats, that can only mean one thing. You'll find that this strategy works\nfor any possible arrangement of the hats. The first prisoner has a 50% chance of\ngiving a wrong answer about his own hat, but the parity information he conveys allows everyone else \nto guess theirs with absolute certainty. Each begins by expecting to see an odd\nor even number of hats of the specified color. If what they count doesn't match,\nthat means their own hat is that color. And everytime this happens, the next person in line will switch\nthe parity they expect to see. So that's it, you're free to go.

{"page": 94, "lesson": 16, "title": "What \"Orwellian\" really means - Noah Tavlin", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-orwellian-really-means-noah-tavlin", "transcript": {"en": "If you've watched the news\nor followed politics chances are you've heard \nthe term Orwellian thrown around \nin one context or another. But have you ever stopped to think\nabout what it really means, or why it's used so often? The term was named \nafter British author Eric Blair known by his pen name George Orwell. Because his most famous work,\nthe novel \"1984,\" depicts an oppressive society \nunder a totalitarian government, \"Orwellian\" is often used simply\nto mean authoritarian. But using the term in this way not only fails to fully \nconvey Orwell's message, it actually risks doing precisely what \nhe tried to warn against. Orwell was indeed opposed \nto all forms of tyranny, spending much of his life fighting against\nanti-democratic forces of both the left-wing and the right. But he was also deeply concerned\nwith how such ideologies proliferate. And one of his most profound insights was the importance that language plays\nin shaping our thoughts and opinions. The government of \"1984\"'s Oceania\ncontrols its people's actions and speech in some ways that are obvious. Their every move and word \nis watched and heard, and the threat of what happens \nto those who step out of line is always looming overhead. Other forms of control are not so obvious. The population is inundated \nwith a constant barrage of propaganda made up of historical facts and statistics\nmanufactured in the Ministry of Truth. The Ministry of Peace is the military. Labor camps are called \"Joycamps.\" Political prisoners are detained\nand tortured in the Ministry of Love. This deliberate irony is an example\nof doublespeak, when words are used not to convey meaning\nbut to undermine it, corrupting the very ideas they refer to. The regime's control of language \ngoes even further, eliminating words from \nthe English language to create the official \ndialect of Newspeak, a crudely limited collection of acronyms\nand simple concrete nouns lacking any words complex enough\nto encourage nuanced or critical thought. This has an effect on the psyche\nOrwell calls, \"Doublethink,\" a hypnotic state of cognitive dissonance in which one is compelled \nto disregard their own perception in place of the officially \ndictated version of events, leaving the individual \ncompletely dependent on the State's definition \nof reality itself. The result is a world in which even the privacy of one's \nown thought process is violated, where one may be found guilty\nof thoughtcrime by talking in their sleep, and keeping a diary \nor having a love affair equals a subversive act of rebellion. This might sound like something that can\nonly happen in totalitarian regimes, but Orwell was warning us about\nthe potential for this occurring even in democratic societies. And this is why \"authoritarian\" alone\ndoes not \"Orwellian\" make. In his essay, \n\"Politics and the English Language,\" he described techniques like using\npretentious words to project authority, or making atrocities sound acceptable\nby burying them in euphemisms and convoluted sentence structures. But even more mundane abuses of language\ncan affect the way we think about things. The words you see \nand hear in everyday advertising have been crafted to appeal to you\nand affect your behavior, as have the soundbites and talking points\nof political campaigns which rarely present the most\nnuanced perspective on the issues. And the way that we use ready-made phrases\nand responses gleaned from media reports or copied from the Internet makes it easy to get away \nwith not thinking too deeply or questioning your assumptions. So the next time you hear someone\nuse the word Orwellian, pay close attention. If they're talking about the deceptive\nand manipulative use of language, they're on the right track. If they're talking about mass surveillance\nand intrusive government, they're describing something authoritarian\nbut not necessarily Orwellian. And if they use it as an all-purpose word\nfor any ideas they dislike, it's possible their statements \nare more Orwellian than whatever it is they're criticizing. Words have the power to shape thought. Language is the currency of politics, forming the basis of society from\nthe most common, everyday interactions to the highest ideals. Orwell urged us to protect our language because ultimately our ability to think\nand communicate clearly is what stands between us and a world\nwhere war is peace and freedom is slavery."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The word Orwellian refers to the work of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "James Orwell, Member of British Parliament during World War II"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dave Orwell, chemist who developed weapons for Britain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "George Orwell, author"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ron Orwell, professional Cricket player"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who is the protagonist of Nineteen Eighty-Four?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "George Orwell"}, {"label": "B", "text": "David Cameron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Winston Smith"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Winston Churchill"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following is one way that Big Brother and his regime do NOT exercise control of language?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Naming institutions to disguise and conceal their actual purpose and function"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eliminating words from the vocabulary"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Creating a new, official language called \"Newspeak\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "Shutting down all schools"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following is one of the effects of introducing \"Newspeak\"? -- A language with a vocabulary reduced by censorship.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People re-invent words as they need them"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It encourages people to pick up a second language"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It makes poetry more relevant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It discourages independent and critical thought"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "True or false: George Orwell gave his unconditional endorsement to all left-leaning political parties.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

of democracy for the very first time decisions were made by the people instead of rulers but sadly the ancient Greeks did not see all people equally slaves women children and the people who did not have a land weren't allowed to vote this is what we call a flawed democracy today after the Greeks lost their power and influence in the first century AD their early forms of democracy were also fading away until the Magna Carta was signed in 1215 which prevented the King of England to do whatever he wanted and said that even the king had to follow the country's rules and laws which were written in the Constitution today most democracies are indirect or representative which means that you can't vote for a new law yourself but you can vote for people who then become lawmakers and present your interests but democracy isn't just about voting it's about everything to protect the best interests of the people no matter what is their race gender political opinion or religion these interests can be human rights quality of life infrastructure and many more modern democracies divine power into three different branches the legislative the people who make the law the executive the people who make sure that you obey the law and the judiciary who judge you if you commit a crime these three are independent and work following the process checks and balances which means all the work must be clear and fair and very important the people who have power also must follow the law and not exceed their authority in addition a democratic government must work in a way that reflects the wish feeling desire and values of the society that it governs this is also known as the general will which is a concept developed by the famous Swiss philosopher jean-jacques Rousseau one of the problems of democratic voting is that the biggest groups of people always have the most power and that's why a good democracy also has laws to protect the rights of its smaller and weaker groups a democracy where the majority chooses to separate expel or injure its minority is not a functioning democracy so what do you think now about democracy Winston Churchill once said democracy is the worst

The Great Wall began as multiple walls\nof rammed earth built by individual feudal states\nduring the Chunqiu period to protect against nomadic raiders\nnorth of China and each other. When Emperor Qin Shi Huang\nunified the states in 221 BCE, the Tibetan Plateau and Pacific Ocean\nbecame natural barriers, but the mountains in the north\nremained vulnerable to Mongol, Turkish, and Xiongnu invasions. To defend against them, the Emperor expanded the small walls\nbuilt by his predecessors, connecting some and fortifying others. As the structures grew\nfrom Lintao in the west to Liaodong in the east, they collectively became known\nas The Long Wall. To accomplish this task, the Emperor enlisted soldiers\nand commoners, not always voluntarily. Of the hundreds of thousands of builders\nrecorded during the Qin Dynasty, many were forcibly conscripted peasants and others were criminals\nserving out sentences. Under the Han Dynasty,\nthe wall grew longer still, reaching 3700 miles, and spanning from Dunhuang\nto the Bohai Sea. Forced labor continued\nunder the Han Emperor Han-Wudi , and the walls reputation grew\ninto a notorious place of suffering. Poems and legends of the time\ntold of laborers buried in nearby mass graves, or even within the wall itself. And while no human remains\nhave been found inside, grave pits do indicate\nthat many workers died from accidents, hunger and exhaustion. The wall was formidable\nbut not invincible. Both Genghis and his son Khublai Khan\nmanaged to surmount the wall during the Mongol invasion\nof the 13th Century. After the Ming dynasty\ngained control in 1368, they began to refortify\nand further consolidate the wall using bricks and stones from local kilns. Averaging 23 feet high and 21 feet wide, the walls 5500 miles\nwere punctuated by watchtowers. When raiders were sighted, fire and smoke signals traveled\nbetween towers until reinforcements arrived. Small openings along the wall\nlet archers fire on invaders, while larger ones were used\nto drop stones and more. But even this new and improved wall\nwas not enough. In 1644, northern Manchu clans\noverthrew the Ming to establish the Qing dynasty, incorporating Mongolia as well, Thus, for the second time, China was ruled by the very people\nthe wall had tried to keep out. With the empire's borders\nnow extending beyond the Great Wall, the fortifications lost their purpose. And without regular reinforcement,\nthe wall fell into disrepair, rammed earth eroded, while brick and stone were plundered\nfor building materials. But its job wasn't finished. During World War II, China used sections for defense\nagainst Japanese invasion, and some parts are still rumored\nto be used for military training. But the Wall's main purpose\ntoday is cultural. As one of the largest man-made\nstructures on Earth, it was granted UNESCO\nWorld Heritage Status in 1987. Originally built to keep\npeople out of China, the Great Wall now welcomes\nmillions of visitors each year. In fact, the influx of tourists\nhas caused the wall to deteriorate, leading the Chinese government\nto launch preservation initiatives. It's also often acclaimed as the only\nman-made structure visible from space. Unfortunately, that's not at all true. In low Earth orbit,\nall sorts of structures, like bridges, highways\nand airports are visible, and the Great Wall\nis only barely discernible. From the moon, it doesn't stand a chance.

You may be tempted to use \nthese words interchangeably because they all refer to the same thing, but in fact, each one has a specific role\nin a sentence. \"I\" is a subject pronoun, \"me\" is an object pronoun, and \"myself\" is a reflexive\nor intensive pronoun. So what does that reveal about\nwhere each word belongs? Let's start with the difference\nbetween subject and object. Imagine the subject \nas the actor in a sentence and the object as the word\nthat is acted upon. \"I invited her but she invited me.\" The object can also be \nthe object of a preposition. \"She danced around me, \nwhile he shimmied up to me.\" In some languages, like Latin and Russian, most nouns have different forms\nthat distinguish subjects from objects. However, in English, \nthat's only true of pronouns. But so long as you know how to distinguish\nsubjects from objects, you can figure out what belongs where. And when you encounter \na more complicated sentence, say one that involves \nmultiple subjects or objects, and you're not sure \nwhether to use \"I\" or \"me,\" just temporarily eliminate \nthe other person, and once again distinguish \nsubject from object. Here's another. You wouldn't say, \"Me heard gossip,\"\nbut sub in \"I\" and you're good to go. Then what about \"myself?\" This grand character is often substituted\nfor \"me\" and \"I\" because it seems more impressive. \"Please tell Jack or myself\" \nmay sound elegant, but in fact, \"me\" \nis the right pronoun here. So where should you use \"myself\"? In its function as a reflexive pronoun, \"myself\" only works \nif it's the object of a sentence whose subject is \"I.\" \"I consider myself the most important\npronoun at this year's party.\" \"Myself\" can also add emphasis\nas an intensive pronoun. \"I, myself, have heard others agree.\" The sentence works without it, but that extra pronoun gives it oomph. To check if \"myself\" belongs \nin a sentence, simply ensure that there's also an \"I\"\nthat it's reflecting or intensifying. So that's \"me,\" \"myself,\" and \"I,\" ever ready to represent \nyou, yourself, and you."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The pronoun 'I' is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A reflexive pronoun"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An adjective pronoun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An objective pronoun"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A subject pronoun"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The pronoun 'me' is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A reflexive pronoun"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An object pronoun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Always a subject"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The most important pronoun"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "'Myself' can be an intensive pronoun and its job in that role is to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Create emphasis in a sentence"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Refer back to another pronoun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Intensify the language"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Make the pronouns clearer"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In a sentence:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Objects and subjects are interchangeable"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Objects are superior to subjects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Objects do the acting"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Subjects act upon objects"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "You should use the word 'myself' wherever you can because it sounds elegant and impressive.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 94, "lesson": 20, "title": "Do animals have language? - Michele Bishop", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/do-animals-have-language-michele-bishop", "transcript": {"en": "All animals communicate. Crabs wave their claws at each other\nto signal that they're healthy and ready to mate. Cuttlefish use pigmented skin cells\ncalled chromatophores to create patterns on their skin\nthat act as camouflage or warnings to rivals. Honeybees perform complex dances to let other bees know the location\nand quality of a food source. All of these animals have impressive\ncommunication systems, but do they have language? To answer that question, we can look at four specific qualities\nthat are often associated with language: discreteness, grammar, productivity, and displacement. Discreteness means that there is a set\nof individual units, such as sounds or words, that can be combined\nto communicate new ideas, like a set of refrigerator poetry magnets\nyou can rearrange to create different phrases. Grammar provides a system of rules that tells you how to combine \nthose individual units. Productivity is the ability \nto use language to create an infinite number of messages. And displacement is the ability \nto talk about things that aren't right in front of you, such as past, future, or fictional events. So, does animal communication exhibit \nany of these qualities? For crabs and cuttlefish, \nthe answer is no. They don't combine their signals \nin creative ways. Those signals also don't have to be \nin a grammatical order, and they only communicate \ncurrent conditions, like, \"I am healthy,\" \nor \"I am poisonous.\" But some animals actually do display\nsome of these properties. Bees use the moves, angle, duration,\nand intensity of their waggle dance to describe the location and richness\nof a food source. That source is outside the hive, so they exhibit the property \nof displacement. They share that language trait\nwith prairie dogs, which live in towns of thousands, and are hunted by coyotes, hawks,\nbadgers, snakes, and humans. Their alarms calls indicate\nthe predator's size, shape, speed, and, even for human predators,\nwhat the person is wearing and if he's carrying a gun. Great apes, like chimps and gorillas,\nare great communicators, too. Some have even learned \na modified sign language. A chimpanzee named Washoe\ndemonstrated discreteness by combining multiple signs\ninto original phrases, like, \"Please open. Hurry.\" Coco, a female gorilla who understands\nmore than 1000 signs, and around 2000 words of spoken English referred to a beloved kitten \nthat had died. In doing so, she displayed displacement, though it's worth noting that the apes\nin both of these examples were using a human communication system, not one that appeared \nnaturally in the wild. There are many other examples\nof sophisticated animal communication, such as in dolphins, which use whistles to identify age, \nlocation, names, and gender. They can also understand some grammar in a gestural language researchers use\nto communicate with them. However, grammar is not seen \nin the dolphin's natural communication. While these communication systems may have some of the qualities \nof language we've identified, none display all four. Even Washoe and Coco's impressive \nabilities are still outpaced by the language skills \nof most three-year-old humans. And animals' topics of conversation\nare usually limited. Bees talk about food, prairie dogs talk about predators, and crabs talk about themselves. Human language stands alone due to the powerful combination\nof grammar and productivity, on top of discreteness and displacement. The human brain can take \na finite number of elements and create an infinite number of messages. We can craft and understand \ncomplex sentences, as well as words that have never\nbeen spoken before. We can use language to communicate\nabout an endless range of subjects, talk about imaginary things, and even lie. Research continues to reveal more\nand more about animal communication. It may turn out that human language\nand animal communication aren't entirely different\nbut exist on a continuum.

The inception date in 776 BC became the basis \nfor the Greek's earliest calendar, where time was marked \nin four-year increments called olympiads. What could it be? Why, it's the Olympic games, of course. Competition fosters excellence,\nor so thought the Ancient Greeks. In addition to sporting events, contests were held for music, \nsinging, and poetry. You can read about them all yourself\nin classical literary works, like Homer's \"Iliad\" \nand Virgil's \"Aeneid.\" Even mythical heroes appreciate \na good contest every now and then, wouldn't you say? For the first thirteen games, the Ancient Greek Olympics featured\njust one event, the two hundred yard dash. But over time, new exciting contests, like boxing, chariot and mule racing, and even a footrace where the competitors\nwore a full suit of armor enticed many hopeful champions\ninto the Olympic stadium. The combined running, jumping, wrestling, javelin throwing, and hurling the discus events known as the pentathlon\ninspired world-class competition, and the pankration, a no holds barred fight where only\nbiting and eye-gouging were prohibited, ensured the toughest men were victorious. And victorious they were. Nobody tops the local baker Coroebus, who 776 BC became the very first\nOlympic champion. And we'll never forget Orsippus of Megara, the 720 BC Olympic victor tore away\nhis loincloth so he could race unimpeded, inaugurating the Ancient Greek tradition\nof competing in the nude. Now there's a winning streak,\nif ever we've seen one. But all good things must end. In 391 AD, the Christian Roman Emperor\nTheodosius banned pagan practices, so the world soon bid a fond farewell\nto the Olympic games. But just like those early \npankration athletes, you can't keep a good one down, and 1500 years later in 1896, the modern Olympic games\nkicked off in Athens, Greece.

Pulling that lever with the skull symbol\njust to see what it did probably wasn't so smart, either, but now is not the time for regrets because you need to get away\nfrom these mutant zombies fast. With you are the janitor, \nthe lab assistant, and the old professor. You've gotten a headstart,\nbut there's only one way to safety: across an old rope bridge\nspanning a massive gorge. You can dash across in a minute, while the lab assistant takes two minutes. The janitor is a bit slower\nand needs five minutes, and the professor takes\na whole ten minutes, holding onto the ropes \nevery step of the way. By the professor's calculations, the zombies will catch up to you\nin just over 17 minutes, so you only have that much time\nto get everyone across and cut the ropes. Unfortunately, the bridge can only hold\ntwo people at a time. To make matters worse, it's so dark out that you can barely see, and the old lantern you grabbed on\nyour way only illuminates a tiny area. Can you figure out a way\nto have everyone escape in time? Remember: no more than two people\ncan cross the bridge together, anyone crossing must either\nhold the lantern or stay right next to it, and any of you can safely wait in the dark\non either side of the gorge. Most importantly, everyone must be\nsafely across before the zombies arrive. Otherwise, the first zombie could step on\nthe bridge while people are still on it. Finally, there are no tricks to use here. You can't swing across, use the bridge as a raft, or befriend the zombies. Pause the video now \nif you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 At first it might seem \nlike no matter what you do, you're just a minute or two short of time,\nbut there is a way. The key is to minimize the time wasted\nby the two slowest people by having them cross together. And because you'll need to make\na couple of return trips with the lantern, you'll want to have the fastest people\navailable to do so. So, you and the lab assistant quickly\nrun across with the lantern, though you have to slow down \na bit to match her pace. After two minutes, both of you are across, and you, as the quickest, \nrun back with the lantern. Only three minutes have passed. So far, so good. Now comes the hard part. The professor and the janitor take\nthe lantern and cross together. This takes them ten minutes since the janitor has to slow down \nfor the old professor who keeps muttering that he probably shouldn't \nhave given the zombies night vision. By the time they're across,\nthere are only four minutes left, and you're still stuck\non the wrong side of the bridge. But remember, the lab assistant\nhas been waiting on the other side, and she's the second fastest of the group. So she grabs the lantern \nfrom the professor and runs back across to you. Now with only two minutes left,\nthe two of you make the final crossing. As you step on the far side of the gorge, you cut the ropes \nand collapse the bridge behind you, just in the nick of time.

To lighten things up, one pretended\nto be Poseidon by placing a seaweed garland on his head\nand then throwing it into the ocean. Moments later, a dolphin surfaced\nwith the seaweed crowning her head. Sure, this could have been a coincidence, but it's also entirely possible that\nthe dolphin was mimicking the scientist. That's because dolphins are one\nof the smartest animals species on Earth. So exactly how smart are they? Like whales and porpoises, dolphins belong to the group\nof aquatic mammals known as cetaceans\nwho comprise 86 different species, and share a common link with ungulates,\nor hoofed animals. Originally land mammals, the first cetaceans entered the water\nabout 55 million years ago as large predators with sharp teeth. Then, a shift in ocean temperatures\nabout 35 million years ago reduced the availability of prey. One group of cetaceans who survived\nthis distruption, the odontocetes, wound up smaller\nwith less sharp teeth, but also larger and more complex brains that allowed for complex \nsocial relationships, as well as echolocation to navigate\nand communicate. Jump ahead to the present, and modern dolphins' brains are so large\nthat their encephalization quotient, their brain size compared to the average\nfor their body size, is second only to humans. Dolphins have evolved to survive through their ability to form \ncomplex social networks that hunt, ward off rivals,\nand raise offspring together. For example, one group of Florida dolphins practices a sophisticated form\nof cooperation to hunt fish. A dolphin designated \nas \"the net-maker\" kicks up mud while another gives the signal for the other dolphins to simultaneously\nline up and catch the escaping fish. Achieving a goal like this requires\ndeliberate planning and cooperation, which, in turn, requires some form\nof intentional communication. Dolphins pass down their communication\nmethods and other skills from generation to generation. Different dolphin populations exhibit\nvariations in greetings, hunting strategies,\nand other behaviors. This sort of cultural transmission\neven extends to tool use. One group of bottlenose dolphins\noff the Australian coast nicknamed The Dolphin Sponge Club, has learned how to cover their rostrums\nwith sponges when rooting in sharp corals, passing the knowledge \nfrom mother to daughter. Dolphins have even demonstrated\nlanguage comprehension. When taught a language based on\nwhistles and hand gestures, they not only understood\nwhat the signals meant, but that their order had meaning: the difference between \nbringing the ball to the hoop and bringing the hoop to the ball. So they were able to process two\nof the main elements of human language: symbols that stand \nfor objects and actions, and syntax that governs \nhow they are structured. Dolphins are also one of the few species\nwho pass the mirror test. By recognizing themselves in mirrors,\nthey indicate physical self-awareness, and research shows they can recognize\nnot just their bodies, but also their own thoughts,\na property called metacognition. In one study, \ndolphins comparing two sounds could indicate a same, different,\nor uncertain response. Just like humans, they indicated uncertainty\nmore often with difficult trials, suggesting they're aware \nof what they know, and how confident they feel\nabout that knowledge. But some of the most amazing things\nabout dolphins are their senses of empathy, altruism,\nand attachment. The habit of helping injured individuals\nextends across the species barrier as evidenced by the many accounts of dolphins carrying humans\nto the surface to breathe. And like us, dolphins mourn their dead. When we consider all the evidence, we may wonder why humans still hunt\ndolphins for meat, endanger them through fishing\nand pollution, or imprison them to perform tricks. The ultimate question may not be\nwhether dolphins are intelligent and complex beings, but whether humans can empathize with them\nenough to keep them safe and free."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Cetaceans are descended from land mammals who:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Had horns"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Were closely related to sharks"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Had hooves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Had very large brains"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "About 35 million years ago the early versions of modern dolphins:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Bceame larger in body size than the previous group of cetaceans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Developed more formidable teeth than their predecessors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Still lived on land part of the time"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Started to echolocate"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Dolphins have metacognition.

There's reason to doubt\nthat Mark Twain ever said this at all, thus, ironically, proving the point. And today, the quote, whoever said it,\nis truer than ever before. In previous decades, \nmost media with global reach consisted of several \nmajor newspapers and networks which had the resources\nto gather information directly. Outlets like Reuters\nand the Associated Press that aggregate or rereport stories\nwere relatively rare compared to today. The speed with which \ninformation spreads now has created the ideal conditions for\na phenomenon known as circular reporting. This is when publication A\npublishes misinformation, publication B reprints it, and publication A then cites B\nas the source for the information. It's also considered a form\nof circular reporting when multiple publications report on the same initial piece \nof false information, which then appears to another author as\nhaving been verified by multiple sources. For instance, the 1998 publication\nof a single pseudoscientific paper arguing that routine vaccination\nof children causes autism inspired an entire \nantivaccination movement, despite the fact that the original paper\nhas repeatedly been discredited by the scientific community. Deliberately unvaccinated children\nare now contracting contagious diseases that had been virtually \neradicated in the United States, with some infections proving fatal. In a slightly less dire example, satirical articles that are formatted\nto resemble real ones can also be picked up by outlets\nnot in on the joke. For example, a joke article in the\nreputable British Medical Journal entitled \"Energy Expenditure in Adolescents\nPlaying New Generation Computer Games,\" has been referenced in serious\nscience publications over 400 times. User-generated content, such as wikis, are also a common contributer\nto circular reporting. As more writers come to rely\non such pages for quick information, an unverified fact in a wiki page\ncan make its way into a published article that may later be added as a citation\nfor the very same wiki information, making it much harder to debunk. Recent advances \nin communication technology have had immeasurable benefits in breaking down the barriers\nbetween information and people. But our desire for quick answers may overpower the desire \nto be certain of their validity. And when this bias can be multiplied by\nbillions of people around the world, nearly instantaneously,\nmore caution is in order. Avoiding sensationalist media, searching for criticisms \nof suspicious information, and tracing the original source\nof a report can help slow down a lie, giving the truth more time \nto put on its shoes."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What makes circular reporting 'circular'?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is round and symmetrical"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It has neither a beginning nor an end"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Sources become validated by themselves in a logical loop"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is uniformly consistent in its reporting"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following has NOT directly contributed to an increase of circular reporting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The speed of the news cycle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The ability for anyone to write, edit and publish on the Internet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Increased accessibility to the Internet"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Human curiosity"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why might the anti-vaccer movement be considered a product of circular reporting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It is based on misinformation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The body of literature and information supporting the theory can all be traced to one, initial, discredited source"}, {"label": "C", "text": "As a movement, it has enough momentum to be considered a serious problem"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Because the media has reported on the anti-vaccine movement"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Before the 20th century, because it took longer to publish writing, it was more accurate.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT an example of circular reporting?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When one incorrect source informs multiple sources, which are then cited as multiple verifications of the incorrect information"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When a website is edited to include false information without verification, someone writes an article based on the un-cited fact, and then someone uses that article to verify the false information on the original website"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When an incorrect source directly informs another source, and the two sources are considered to have independently verified the same information"}, {"label": "D", "text": "When a source intentionally provides false information to a writer"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}
