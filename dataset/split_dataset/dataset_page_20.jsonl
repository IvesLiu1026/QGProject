Pate", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-mysterious-science-of-pain-joshua-w-pate", "transcript": {"en": "In 1995, the British Medical Journal published an astonishing report \nabout a 29-year-old builder. He accidentally jumped \nonto a 15-centimeter nail, which pierced straight through \nhis steel-toed boot. He was in such agonizing pain that even \nthe smallest movement was unbearable. But when the doctors took off his boot, \nthey faced a surprising sight: the nail had never touched \nhis foot at all. For hundreds of years, scientists thought that pain was \na direct response to damage. By that logic, the more severe an injury \nis, the more pain it should cause. But as we’ve learned more about \nthe science of pain, we’ve discovered that pain and tissue \ndamage don’t always go hand in hand, even when the body’s threat signaling \nmechanisms are fully functioning. We’re capable of experiencing severe pain \nout of proportion to an actual injury, and even pain without any injury, like the builder, or the well-documented \ncases of male partners of pregnant women experiencing pain\nduring the pregnancy or labor. What’s going on here? There are actually two phenomena at play: the experience of pain, and a biological \nprocess called nociception. Nociception is part of the nervous \nsystem’s protective response to harmful or potentially harmful stimuli. Sensors in specialized nerve endings detect mechanical, thermal, \nand chemical threats. If enough sensors are activated, electrical signals shoot up the nerve \nto the spine and on to the brain. The brain weighs the importance \nof these signals and produces pain if it decides \nthe body needs protection. Typically, pain helps the body \navoid further injury or damage. But there are a whole set of factors \nbesides nociception that can influence the experience of pain—\nand make pain less useful. First, there are biological factors that \namplify nociceptive signals to the brain. If nerve fibers are activated repeatedly, the brain may decide they need \nto be more sensitive to adequately protect the body \nfrom threats. More stress sensors can be \nadded to nerve fibers until they become so sensitive that \neven light touches to the skin spark intense electrical signals. In other cases, nerves adapt to send signals more \nefficiently, amplifying the message. These forms of amplification  are most common in people experiencing \nchronic pain, which is defined as pain lasting \nmore than 3 months. When the nervous system is nudged \ninto an ongoing state of high alert, pain can outlast physical injury. This creates a vicious cycle in which \nthe longer pain persists, the more difficult it becomes to reverse. Psychological factors clearly \nplay a role in pain too, potentially by influencing nociception and\nby influencing the brain directly. A person’s emotional state, memories, beliefs about pain and expectations \nabout treatment can all influence how much \npain they experience. In one study, children who reported believing they \nhad no control over pain actually experienced more intense pain than those who believed they \nhad some control. Features of the environment matter too: In one experiment, volunteers with a cold rod placed on \nthe back of their hand reported feeling more pain when they were \nshown a red light than a blue one, even though the rod was the same \ntemperature each time. Finally, social factors like the \navailability of family support can affect perception of pain. All of this means that a multi-pronged \napproach to pain treatment that includes pain specialists, physical \ntherapists, clinical psychologists, nurses and other healthcare professionals \nis often most effective. We’re only beginning to uncover the \nmechanisms behind the experience of pain, but there are some promising \nareas of research. Until recently, we thought the glial cells surrounding \nneurons were just support structures, but now we know they have a huge role \nin influencing nociception. Studies have shown that disabling certain \nbrain circuits in the amygdala can eliminate pain in rats. And genetic testing in people with \nrare disorders that prevent them from feeling pain have pinpointed several other \npossible targets for drugs and perhaps eventually gene therapy."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A simpler phrase to understand than ‘nociception’ is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Pain messaging"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hurt messaging"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Danger messaging"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ouch messaging"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The case study from the British Medical Journal was about a builder who felt significant pain when a nail didn’t even touch his body.

Anything that gets too close to the \ncentral singularity of a black hole, be it an asteroid, planet, or star, risks being torn apart by its \nextreme gravitational field. And if the approaching object happens \nto cross the black hole’s event horizon, it’ll disappear and never re-emerge, adding to the black hole’s mass and \nexpanding its radius in the process. There is nothing we could throw \nat a black hole that would do the least bit of \ndamage to it. Even another black hole won’t destroy it– the two will simply merge into a larger\nblack hole, releasing a bit of energy as gravitational\nwaves in the process. By some accounts, it’s possible that the universe may \neventually consist entirely of black holes in a very distant future. And yet, there may be a way to destroy, \nor “evaporate,” these objects after all. If the theory is true, all we need to do is to wait. In 1974, Stephen Hawking theorized a process that could lead a black hole \nto gradually lose mass. Hawking radiation, as it came to be known, is based on a well-established phenomenon\ncalled quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. According to quantum mechanics, a given point in spacetime fluctuates \nbetween multiple possible energy states. These fluctuations are driven by the \ncontinuous creation and destruction of virtual particle pairs, which consist of a particle and its \noppositely charged antiparticle. Normally, the two collide and annihilate \neach other shortly after appearing, preserving the total energy. But what happens when they appear just at\nthe edge of a black hole’s event horizon? If they’re positioned just right, one of the particles could escape the \nblack hole’s pull while its counterpart falls in. It would then annihilate another \noppositely charged particle within the event horizon \nof the black hole, reducing the black hole’s mass. Meanwhile, to an outside observer, it would look like the black hole \nhad emitted the escaped particle. Thus, unless a black hole continues \nto absorb additional matter and energy, it’ll evaporate particle by particle, \nat an excruciatingly slow rate. How slow? A branch of physics, called black hole\nthermodynamics, gives us an answer. When everyday objects or celestial bodies\nrelease energy to their environment, we perceive that as heat, and can use their energy emission to \nmeasure their temperature. Black hole thermodynamics suggests that we can similarly define the\n“temperature” of a black hole. It theorizes that the more massive the \nblack hole, the lower its temperature. The universe’s largest black holes would give off temperatures of the\norder of 10 to the -17th power Kelvin, very close to absolute zero. Meanwhile, one with the\nmass of the asteroid Vesta would have a temperature close to 200\ndegrees Celsius, thus releasing a lot of energy \nin the form of Hawking Radiation to the cold outside environment. The smaller the black hole, the hotter it seems to be burning– and the sooner it’ll burn out completely. Just how soon? Well, don’t hold your breath. First of all, most black holes accrete, \nor absorb matter and energy, more quickly than they emit\nHawking radiation. But even if a black hole with the \nmass of our Sun stopped accreting, it would take 10 to the 67th power years– many many magnitudes longer than the\ncurrent age of the Universe— to fully evaporate. When a black hole reaches \nabout 230 metric tons, it’ll have only one more second to live. In that final second, its event horizon becomes \nincreasingly tiny, until finally releasing all of its energy \nback into the universe. And while Hawking radiation has never \nbeen directly observed, some scientists believe that certain gamma\nray flashes detected in the sky are actually traces of the last moments of small, primordial black holes formed \nat the dawn of time. Eventually, in an almost inconceivably\ndistant future, the universe may be left \nas a cold and dark place. But if Stephen Hawking was right, before that happens, the normally terrifying and otherwise\nimpervious black holes will end their existence in a final \nblaze of glory."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "An increase in the mass of a black hole leads its radius to ____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Decrease"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Increase"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Remain constant"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Go to infinity"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Physicists call “annihilation” the process through which:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A black hole explodes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A particle and its anti-particle collide, producing energy (or other particles)"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An electron and a proton interact"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Two anti-particles interact and transform their mass into energy"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The evaporation of a black hole happens because:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Particles inside the event horizon move faster than light and escape"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Two black holes collide and destroy each other"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Members of a virtual pair get cut-off by an event horizon and it is “as if” the black hole emits a real particle."}, {"label": "D", "text": "The ambient temperature of the space is very high, so that black holes evaporate like water in a boiling pot."}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The bigger the black hole, the ____ its temperature is.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lower"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Higher"}, {"label": "C", "text": "More difficult to compute"}, {"label": "D", "text": "This question makes no sense.

{"page": 20, "lesson": 3, "title": "Why should you read “Crime and Punishment”? - Alex Gendler", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-crime-and-punishment-alex-gendler", "transcript": {"en": "What drives someone to kill in cold blood? What goes through the murderer’s mind? And what kind of a society \nbreeds such people? Over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky \ntook these questions up in what would become one of the \nbest-known works of Russian literature: \"Crime and Punishment.\" First serialized in a literary \nmagazine in 1866, the novel tells the story of Rodion \nRomanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run \nout of funds to continue his studies. Letters from his rural home \nonly add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and \nsister have sacrificed for his success. Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables\nto an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan \nto murder and rob her. But the impact of carrying out \nthis unthinkable act proves to be more than \nhe was prepared for. Though the novel is sometimes cited as one\nof the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond \nRaskolnikov’s inner turmoil. From dank taverns to dilapidated \napartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint \nPetersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose. We’re introduced to characters \nsuch as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who \nhas drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged \nand lecherous nobleman. As Raskolnikov’s own family \narrives in town, their moral innocence stands \nin stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow \nincreasingly intertwined. This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life \nexperiences and evolving ideas. As a young writer who left behind \na promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to \nideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to \ndiscuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government. Upon exposure, members of this group, including \nDostoyevsky, were arrested. Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution \nand last-minute pardon from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky spent the next four \nyears in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854. The experience left him with a far \nmore pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward \nspiritual concerns. In the 1864 novella \"Notes from \nUnderground,\" he expounded on his belief that utopian\nWestern philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory \nyearnings of the human soul. \"Crime and Punishment\" was conceived \nand completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes. In many ways, the novel follows a common \nnarrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and\ncorrupted by the dangers of urban life. But its social critique cuts far deeper. Raskolnikov rationalizes that \nhis own advancement at the cost of the exploitative \npawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society. In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism \nand utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s \ncontemporary intellectuals. And in believing that his intelligence \nallows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from \nhis own humanity. Yet although the book is deeply \nconcerned with morality, \"Crime and Punishment\" never comes across\nas merely moralizing, with each character given their own \ndistinctive and convincing voice. One of the most remarkable things about\n\"Crime and Punishment\" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder \nbeing revealed in the first act. Raskolnikov’s crime is clear. But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s \ngripping account of the ensuing social and \npsychological turmoil that we learn the true nature \nof his punishment– and the possibility of redemption."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is Raskolnikov’s occupation?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Military officer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Law student"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Schoolteacher"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nurse"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In what city does the novel take place?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Saint Petersburg"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Moscow"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vienna"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Whom does Raskolnikov kill?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A policeman"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A pawnbroker"}, {"label": "C", "text": "His father"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which of the following is NOT a character in the book?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Marmeladov"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Svidrigailov"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bezukhov"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why was Dostoevsky arrested?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Discussing banned texts"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Plotting to overthrow the tsar"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spying for the British Crown"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Suddenly, three hazards appear \nat the same time. What happens next? Before it can navigate this \nonslaught of obstacles, the car has to detect them— gleaning enough information about \ntheir size, shape, and position, so that its control algorithms \ncan plot the safest course. With no human at the wheel, the car needs smart eyes, sensors \nthat’ll resolve these details— no matter the environment, \nweather, or how dark it is— all in a split-second. That’s a tall order, but there’s a \nsolution that partners two things: a special kind of laser-based probe \ncalled LIDAR, and a miniature version of \nthe communications technology that keeps the internet humming,\ncalled integrated photonics. To understand LIDAR, it helps to start \nwith a related technology— radar. In aviation, radar antennas launch pulses \nof radio or microwaves at planes to learn their locations by timing \nhow long the beams take to bounce back. That’s a limited way of seeing, though, because the large beam-size \ncan’t visualize fine details. In contrast, a self-driving car’s \nLIDAR system, which stands for Light Detection \nand Ranging, uses a narrow invisible infrared laser. It can image features as small as the \nbutton on a pedestrian’s shirt across the street. But how do we determine the shape, \nor depth, of these features? LIDAR fires a train of super-short laser \npulses to give depth resolution. Take the moose on the country road. As the car drives by, one LIDAR pulse \nscatters off the base of its antlers, while the next may travel to the tip \nof one antler before bouncing back. Measuring how much longer \nthe second pulse takes to return provides data about the antler’s shape. With a lot of short pulses, a LIDAR system\nquickly renders a detailed profile. The most obvious way to create a pulse \nof light is to switch a laser on and off. But this makes a laser unstable and \naffects the precise timing of its pulses, which limits depth resolution. Better to leave it on, and use something else to periodically \nblock the light reliably and rapidly. That’s where integrated photonics come in. The digital data of the internet is carried by precision-timed \npulses of light, some as short as a hundred picoseconds. One way to create these pulses is \nwith a Mach-Zehnder modulator. This device takes advantage of a \nparticular wave property, called interference. Imagine dropping pebbles into a pond: as the ripples spread and overlap, \na pattern forms. In some places, wave peaks add \nup to become very large; in other places, they completely \ncancel out. The Mach-Zehnder modulator \ndoes something similar. It splits waves of light along two \nparallel arms and eventually rejoins them. If the light is slowed down and \ndelayed in one arm, the waves recombine out of sync and \ncancel, blocking the light. By toggling this delay in one arm, the modulator acts like an on/off switch, \nemitting pulses of light. A light pulse lasting a hundred \npicoseconds leads to a depth resolution of a \nfew centimeters, but tomorrow’s cars will need \nto see better than that. By pairing the modulator with a super-\nsensitive, fast-acting light detector, the resolution can be refined \nto a millimeter. That’s more than a hundred times better  than what we can make out with \n20/20 vision, from across a street. The first generation of automobile LIDAR \nhas relied on complex spinning assemblies that scan from rooftops or hoods. With integrated photonics, modulators and detectors are being shrunk \nto less than a tenth of a millimeter, and packed into tiny chips that’ll one \nday fit inside a car’s lights. These chips will also include a clever \nvariation on the modulator to help do away with moving parts \nand scan at rapid speeds. By slowing the light in a modulator \narm only a tiny bit, this additional device will act more \nlike a dimmer than an on/off switch. If an array of many such arms, each with \na tiny controlled delay, is stacked in parallel, something novel \ncan be designed: a steerable laser beam. From their new vantage, these smart eyes will probe and \nsee more thoroughly than anything nature could’ve imagined— and help navigate any number \nof obstacles. All without anyone breaking a sweat— except for maybe one disoriented moose."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In a LiDAR system, what is the role of super short laser pulses?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "to resolve the width of small objects"}, {"label": "B", "text": "to sample a distance measurement many times"}, {"label": "C", "text": "to resolve the depth of thin objects"}, {"label": "D", "text": "to resolve the depth of objects at great distances"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What happens when you switch a laser on and off rapidly?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "instability in the laser light changes its direction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "instability in the laser pulses limits depth resolution"}, {"label": "C", "text": "instability in the laser pulses limit size resolution"}, {"label": "D", "text": "instability in the laser pulses limit how far they can travel"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How does a Mach Zehnder modulator manipulate light?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "it splits a wave of light into two different optical paths and recombines them out of sync"}, {"label": "B", "text": "it splits a wave of light into two different optical paths and recombines them with a wavelength shift"}, {"label": "C", "text": "it splits a wave of light into two identical optical paths"}, {"label": "D", "text": "it splits a wave of light into two identical optical paths and recombines them with a wavelength shift"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How can integrated photonics transform a LiDAR system in a self-driving car?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "toggle the speed of light in one arm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "resolve the depth of small objects"}, {"label": "C", "text": "shrink the device components into a chip smaller than a millimeter"}, {"label": "D", "text": "resolve the depth of objects at great distances"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "On an integrated photonics chip, what does the device for steering a laser beam have in common with a Mach-Zehnder modulator?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "both devices rely on Time of Flight"}, {"label": "B", "text": "both devices create pulses of light"}, {"label": "C", "text": "both devices split light into multiple optical paths, repeatedly"}, {"label": "D", "text": "both devices slow down the speed of light"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Yates", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-this-disease-changes-the-shape-of-your-cells-amber-m-yates", "transcript": {"en": "What shape are your cells? Squishy cylinders? Jagged zig-zags? You probably don’t think much about\nthe bodies of these building blocks, but at the microscopic level, small \nchanges can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change \nthese shapes for the better, others can spark a cascade of \ndebilitating complications. This is the story of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease affects the \nred blood cells, which transport oxygen from the lungs \nto all the tissues in the body. To perform this vital task, red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin\nproteins to carry oxygen molecules. These proteins float independently inside the red blood cell’s pliable, \ndoughnut-like shape, keeping the cells flexible enough to accommodate even the \ntiniest of blood vessels. But in sickle cell disease, a single genetic mutation alters\nthe structure of hemoglobin. After releasing oxygen to tissues, these mutated proteins lock \ntogether into rigid rows. Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell \nto deform into a long, pointed sickle. These red blood cells are \nharder and stickier, and no longer flow smoothly through \nblood vessels. Sickled cells snag and pile up– sometimes blocking the vessel completely. This keeps oxygen from reaching\na variety of cells, causing the wide range of symptoms experienced by people \nwith sickle-cell disease. Starting when they’re \nless than a year old, patients suffer from repeated episodes of\nstabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues. The location of the clogged vessel determines the specific \nsymptoms experienced. A blockage in the spleen, \npart of the immune system, puts patients at risk for \ndangerous infections. A pileup in the lungs can produce \nfevers and difficulty breathing. A clog near the eye can cause vision \nproblems and retinal detachment. And if the obstructed vessels \nsupply the brain the patient could even \nsuffer a stroke. Worse still, sickled red blood cells \nalso don’t survive very long— just 10 or 20 days, versus a \nhealthy cell’s 4 months. This short lifespan means that patients live with a constantly\ndepleted supply of red blood cells; a condition called sickle-cell anemia. Perhaps what’s most surprising \nabout this malignant mutation is that it originally evolved\nas a beneficial adaptation. Researchers have been able to trace\nthe origins of the sickle cell mutation to regions historically ravaged \nby a tropical disease called malaria. Spread by a parasite found \nin local mosquitoes, malaria uses red blood cells as incubators to spread quickly and lethally \nthrough the bloodstream. However, the same structural changes\nthat turn red blood cells into roadblocks also make them more resistant to malaria. And if a child inherits a copy of the\nmutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal \nhemoglobin to make life difficult for the \nmalaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells retain\ntheir normal shape and function. In regions rife with this parasite, sickle cell mutation offered a serious \nevolutionary advantage. But as the adaptation flourished, it became clear that inheriting the \nmutation from both parents resulted in sickle-cell anemia. Today, most people with \nsickle-cell disease can trace their ancestry to a country\nwhere malaria is endemic. And this mutation still plays a key role\nin Africa, where more than 90% of malaria \ninfections occur worldwide. Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives, our treatment for sickle cell continues \nto improve. For years, hydroxyurea was the only \nmedication available to reduce the amount of sickling, blunting symptoms and \nincreasing life expectancy. Bone marrow transplantations \noffer a curative measure, but these procedures are \ncomplicated and often inaccessible. But promising new medications \nare intervening in novel ways, like keeping oxygen bonded to \nhemoglobin to prevent sickling, or reducing the stickiness \nof sickled cells. And the ability to edit DNA has raised the possibility of enabling \nstem cells to produce normal hemoglobin.

It was one of the worst civilian \ncasualties of the Spanish Civil War, waged between the democratic republic and \nGeneral Franco’s fascist contingent. For Pablo Picasso, the \ntragedy sparked a frenzied period of work in which he produced a \nmassive anti-war mural, aptly titled \"Guernica.\" The painting is a powerful work of \nhistorical documentation and political protest. But while Picasso’s artistic \nmotivations are clear, the symbolism of the painting can be as \nconfusing and chaotic as war itself. How can we make sense of this \noverwhelming image, and what exactly makes it a \nmasterpiece of anti-war art? The painting’s monumental canvas is \ndisorienting from the start, rendered in the abstracted Cubist style \nPicasso pioneered. Cubism deliberately emphasized the \ntwo-dimensionality of the canvas by flattening the objects being painted. This afforded viewers multiple and often impossible perspectives \non the same object; a technique considered shocking \neven in Picasso’s domestic scenes. But in this context, the style offers a profoundly \noverwhelming view of violence, destruction, and casualties. Multiple perspectives only compound\nthe horror on display– sending the eyes hurtling around the \nframe in a futile hunt for peace. On the far left, a woman holding her \ndead child releases a scream; her eyes sliding down her face \nin the shape of tears and her head bending back unnaturally \nto echo her baby’s. There is the statue of a soldier \npresent below, but he is unable to defend \nthe woman and child. Instead his broken body lies in pieces, his arm clutching a splintered sword \nin a signal of utmost defeat. The tip of his sword meets a woman’s foot \nas she attempts to flee the devastation. But her other leg appears \nrooted to the spot, locked in the corner of the canvas \neven as she stretches to move it. Another victim appears \nbehind this slouching figure. Falling helplessly as flames \nlick around her, she too is caught in her \nown hopeless scene. Each of these figures bordering the \npainting are horribly trapped, giving the work an acute \nsense of claustrophobia. And where you might expect the canvas’ \nmassive size to counteract this feeling, its scale only highlights the nearly \nlife-sized atrocities on display. Some possible relief comes from a lamp held tightly by a ghostly woman \nreaching out her window. But is her lantern’s hopeful glow \ntruly lighting the scene? Or is it the jagged lightbulb– thought to represent the technologies \nof modern warfare– which illuminates her view of \nthe chaos below? From the coffin-like confines\nof her window, her arm guides the viewer back \ninto the fray, to perhaps the most controversial\nsymbols of all– two ghostly animals caught \nin the destruction. Does the screaming horse embody the\nthreat of Franco’s military nationalism; or does the spike running through \nits body convey its victimhood? Does the white bull represent Spain, the country of matadors and a common \ntheme in Picasso’s work– or does it stand for the \nbrutality of war? In this scene of strife, these animals \nraise more questions than answers. And additional elements hidden \nthroughout the frame offer even more secrets for \nclose observers. At the top of the canvas flashes a bird \ndesperate to escape the carnage. And the abundance of animals on display \nmay hint at the bombing’s date– a market day which flooded the streets with villagers, animals, and \nother potential causalities. Like the bombing of Guernica itself, Picasso’s painting is dense \nwith destruction. But hidden beneath this supposed chaos,\nare carefully crafted scenes and symbols, carrying out the painting’s multifaceted \nattack on fascism. Decades after its creation, \"Guernica\" retains its power to shock \nviewers and ignite debate, and is often referenced at anti-war \ngatherings around the world. Hundreds of viewers have grappled with \nits harsh imagery, shattering symbolism and complex political messaging. But even without a close understanding \nof it’s complicated subtext, Picasso’s work remains a searing reminder \nof the true casualties of violence."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Picasso painted Guernica in response to events related to the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "First World War"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Second World War"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Spanish Civil War"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Cold War"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Guernica is an example of which artistic style?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Surrealism"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cubism"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Realism"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pointilism"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Guernica is crowded with figures, including:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Animals"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Technology"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Weapons"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Art critics and viewers are generally in agreement about what these figures symbolize:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Today, Guernica is considered:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A dated depiction of war"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A powerful anti-war painting that still has relevance today"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

If you’ve ever swung an axe against a\ntree, you know chipping away wood takes a lot of force. Now imagine chipping away that wood with your\nface. That’s what it’s like to be a woodpecker. Hammering a tree, 20 times a second, ten thousand\ntimes a day… face-first. The force of a peck is like as headbutting\na tree at full sprint, which you should not try at home. So why don’t woodpeckers get concussions? And if they did, what would they see flying\naround their head? [OPEN] They say it’s not the fall that kills you,\nit’s the sudden stop at the end. Anyone who’s ever watched a crash test video\nknows that when the car stops moving, the bodies inside it don’t. This is basically the inside of your head\nright before you get a concussion. The human skull is surprisingly strong and\nflexible, but the delicate hunk of meat inside is more like a blob of jello floating in liquid. A rapid deceleration can cause your brain\nto hit the inside of your skull and damage neurons and other cells. This is called a concussion. I’ve a couple concussions have had before. I felt dizzy, and… I actually don’t remember much else. When your brain gets sloshed and squished,\ntwisting forces happen down on the smallest level, deforming and tearing nerve cells,\nand damaged neurons can’t don’t goodly communicate good. If nerves are damaged in the right area, you\ncan lose consciousness, but you don’t have to be knocked out to get a concussion, and\neven smaller impacts can have lasting damage. CTE is a brain disease caused by repeated\nimpacts that can lead to bad things. When doctors did autopsies on former professional\nfootball players they saw brains that looked wasted away, from years of repeated impacts\nthat weren’t technically concussions. Millions of concussions will happen to young\nathletes this year, and that’s not counting brain injuries from accidents and other causes. It’s a big problem, and some scientists\nare wondering if we can learn anything from hard headed birds. Woodpeckers are built for headbanging. Spongy skull bones, even special eyelids that\nclose just before impact, but their real anti-headache secrets are deeper inside. Woodpeckers will hammer to show off territory\nor make nests, but mostly it’s to look for food. After they drill a hole, they use their tongue\nlike a spear to reach inside and draw out insects or nectar. But considering that tongue can be three\ntimes the length of its beak, where do they keep it when it’s not being used? There’s a bony support /inside/ bird tongues\ncalled the hyoid. We have a hyoid bone too, /underneath/ our\ntongue, but in a woodpecker, it goes out the back of its mouth, all the way around its\nskull, and ends up between its eyes. Scientists think this bone and muscle wrapper\nmay act like a seatbelt and absorb some of the shock when the bird’s head de-celerates. But consider acorn woodpeckers: They can drill\nthousands of holes in a single tree and hammer a seed into each one. A seatbelt tongue can’t be enough to keep\nthem headache-free. One of the basic equations of physics is “Force\nequals mass times acceleration”, or deceleration. But what really matters for impact injury\nis how much area that force is being applied to, or why you should lie on a bed of nails,\nnot do a headstand on one. From the side, the human brain is basically\na half circle, oriented like this. So impact on the forward/backward axis focuses\nthe force on a small area. A woodpecker’s brain is oriented differently,\nso forward/backward force is distributed over a larger area of the brain, and since they’re\npacked more tightly in their skulls, they don’t slosh around like ours do. G-force is our measure of relative acceleration. We normally feel 1 g, the standard acceleration\nof gravity on Earth. The g-force a body can survive depends a lot\non how long that body is being g-forced. If you love roller coasters, you’ve probably\nexperienced several seconds at 5 g’s and walked away smiling. But race car drivers have survived crashes\nwith over 200 g’s, but only because that deceleration was limited to a few milliseconds. Basically if you’re gonna hit something\nhard, it helps to do it quickly. It takes less than a millisecond for a woodpecker’s\nhead to move from full speed to stopped. In that amount of time, our brains could take\n300 g’s before concussion, but woodpecker brains can withstand more than four thousand\nG’s. How is that possible?! This gets us to the real reason woodpeckers\ndon’t get concussions. J.B.S Haldane, in a 1926 essay “On Being\nthe Right Size” wrote that “You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mine shaft; and,\non arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away.” But dropped down the same mine shaft “…A\nrat is killed, a man is broken, a horse splashes.” I don’t think anyone’s actually tested\nthat, but it comes down to simple math. As an animal, or an animal’s brain gets\nsmaller, the volume and mass drop by the cube, but the surface area goes down by the square. So a woodpecker brain might have much much\nless skull area to absorb impact than we do, but it’s much, much, MUCH lighter. An engineer would say woodpecker brains and\nhuman brains are built from the same material, but the mathematics of scale mean that bird\nbrains can take a bigger banging. So the main reason woodpeckers don’t get\nconcussions is because they’re small. I know, it’s kind of obvious, but we’re\nstuck with a hard knock truth: they evolved to take an impact, and we didn’t, and as\nlong as we keep banging our heads into each other for fun or by accident, we’ll probably\nkeep getting concussions, no matter what kind of space-age bubble wrap we put on our heads. That’s being a whole different kind of hard-headed,\nI guess. Stay curious."}, "multiple-choice": []}

We move forward with it - Nora McInerny", "category": "Emotional Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/Zkzjst9e", "transcript": {"en": "So, 2014 was a big year for me. Do you ever have that, just like a big year, like a banner year? For me, it went like this: October 3, I lost my second pregnancy. And then October 8, my dad died of cancer. And then on November 25,\nmy husband Aaron died after three years\nwith stage-four glioblastoma, which is just a fancy word\nfor brain cancer. So, I'm fun. (Laughter) People love to invite me out all the time. Packed social life. Usually, when I talk\nabout this period of my life, the reaction I get is essentially: (Sighs) \"I can't -- I can't imagine.\" But I do think you can. I think you can. And I think that you should because, someday,\nit's going to happen to you. Maybe not these specific losses\nin this specific order or at this speed, but like I said, I'm very fun and the research\nthat I have seen will stun you: everyone you love has\na 100 percent chance of dying. (Laughter) And that's why you came to TED. (Laughter) (Applause) So, since all of this loss happened, I've made it a career\nto talk about death and loss, not just my own,\nbecause it's pretty easy to recap, but the losses and tragedies\nthat other people have experienced. It's a niche, I have to say. (Laughter) It's a small niche,\nand I wish I made more money, but ... (Laughter) I've written some very uplifting books, host a very uplifting podcast,\nI started a little nonprofit. I'm just trying to do what I can to make more people comfortable\nwith the uncomfortable, and grief is so uncomfortable. It's so uncomfortable,\nespecially if it's someone else's grief. So part of that work is this group\nthat I started with my friend Moe, who is also a widow; we call it the Hot Young Widows Club. (Laughter) And it's real, we have membership cards and T-shirts. And when your person dies,\nyour husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, literally don't care if you were married, your friends and your family\nare just going to look around through friends of friends\nof friends of friends until they find someone\nwho's gone through something similar, and then they'll push you\ntowards each other so you can talk amongst yourselves\nand not get your sad on other people. (Laughter) So that's what we do. It's just a series of small groups, where men, women, gay, straight,\nmarried, partnered, can talk about their dead person, and say the things that the other people in their lives\naren't ready or willing to hear yet. Huge range of conversations. Like, \"My husband died two weeks ago, I can't stop thinking\nabout sex, is that normal?\" Yeah. \"What if it's one\nof the Property Brothers?\" Less normal, but I'll accept it. (Laughter) Things like, \"Look, when I'm out in public\nand I see old people holding hands, couples who have clearly\nbeen together for decades, and then I look at them and I imagine all of the things they've been\nthrough together, the good things, the bad things, the arguments they've had\nover who should take out the trash ... I just find my heart filled with rage.\" (Laughter) And that example is personal to me. Most of the conversations\nthat we have in the group can and will just stay amongst ourselves, but there are things that we talk about that the rest of the world --\nthe world that is grief-adjacent but not yet grief-stricken -- could really benefit from hearing. And if you can't tell, I'm only interested in / capable\nof unscientific studies, so what I did was go to\nThe Hot Young Widows Club and say, \"Hello, friends, remember\nwhen your person died?\" They did. \"Do you remember all the things\npeople said to you?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" \"Which ones did you hate the most?\" I got a lot of comments, lot of answers,\npeople say a lot of things, but two rose to the top pretty quickly. \"Moving on.\" Now, since 2014, I will tell you I have remarried\na very handsome man named Matthew, we have four children\nin our blended family, we live in the suburbs\nof Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. We have a rescue dog. (Laughter) I drive a minivan, like the kind where doors open\nand I don't even touch them. (Laughter) Like, by any \"mezhure,\" life is good. I've also never said \"mezhure,\"\nI've never once said it that way. (Laughter) I don't know where that came from. (Laughter) I've never heard\nanyone else say it that way. It looks like it should be said that way, and that's why the English\nlanguage is trash, so ... (Laughter) So impressed with anyone\nwho, like, speaks it in addition to a language\nthat makes sense -- good job. (Laughter) But by any measure ... (Laughter) By any measure, life is really,\nreally good, but I haven't \"moved on.\" I haven't moved on,\nand I hate that phrase so much, and I understand why other people do. Because what it says is that Aaron's life and death\nand love are just moments that I can leave behind me --\nand that I probably should. And when I talk about Aaron,\nI slip so easily into the present tense, and I've always thought\nthat made me weird. And then I noticed that everybody does it. And it's not because we are in denial\nor because we're forgetful, it's because the people\nwe love, who we've lost, are still so present for us. So, when I say, \"Oh, Aaron is ...\" It's because Aaron still is. And it's not in the way\nthat he was before, which was much better, and it's not in the way that churchy\npeople try to tell me that he would be. It's just that he's indelible, and so he is present for me. Here, he's present for me in the work that I do, in the child that we had together, in these three other children I'm raising, who never met him,\nwho share none of his DNA, but who are only in my life\nbecause I had Aaron and because I lost Aaron. He's present in my marriage to Matthew, because Aaron's life and love and death made me the person\nthat Matthew wanted to marry. So I've not moved on from Aaron, I've moved forward with him. (Applause) We spread Aaron's ashes\nin his favorite river in Minnesota, and when the bag was empty -- because when you're cremated,\nyou fit into a plastic bag -- there were still ashes\nstuck to my fingers. And I could have just put my hands\nin the water and rinsed them, but instead, I licked my hands clean, because I was so afraid of losing more\nthan I had already lost, and I was so desperate to make sure\nthat he would always be a part of me. But of course he would be. Because when you watch your person\nfill himself with poison for three years, just so he can stay alive\na little bit longer with you, that stays with you. When you watch him fade from the healthy\nperson he was the night you met to nothing, that stays with you. When you watch your son,\nwho isn't even two years old yet, walk up to his father's bed\non the last day of his life, like he knows what's coming\nin a few hours, and say, \"I love you. All done. Bye, bye.\" That stays with you. Just like when you fall in love,\nfinally, like really fall in love with someone who gets you and sees you and you even see, \"Oh, my God,\nI've been wrong this entire time. Love is not a contest\nor a reality show -- it's so quiet, it's this invisible thread of calm\nthat connects the two of us even when everything is chaos, when things are falling apart,\neven when he's gone.\" That stays with you. We used to do this thing -- because my hands are always\nfreezing and he's so warm, where I would take my ice-cold hands\nand shove them up his shirt ... press them against his hot bod. (Laughter) And he hated it so much, (Laughter) but he loved me, and after he died,\nI laid in bed with Aaron and I put my hands underneath him and I felt his warmth. And I can't even tell you\nif my hands were cold, but I can tell you that I knew it was the last time\nI would ever do that. And that that memory\nis always going to be sad. That memory will always hurt. Even when I'm 600 years old\nand I'm just a hologram. (Laughter) Just like the memory of meeting him\nis always going to make me laugh. Grief doesn't happen in this vacuum, it happens alongside of and mixed in\nwith all of these other emotions. So, I met Matthew, my current husband -- who doesn't love that title, (Laughter) but it's so accurate. (Laughter) I met Matthew, and ... there was this audible sigh of relief\namong the people who love me, like, \"It's over! She did it. She got a happy ending,\nwe can all go home. And we did good.\" And that narrative\nis so appealing even to me, and I thought maybe\nI had gotten that, too, but I didn't. I got another chapter. And it's such a good chapter --\nI love you, honey -- it's such a good chapter. But especially at the beginning,\nit was like an alternate universe, or one of those old \"choose your\nown adventure\" books from the '80s where there are two parallel plot lines. So I opened my heart to Matthew, and my brain was like,\n\"Would you like to think about Aaron? Like, the past, the present, future,\njust get in there,\" and I did. And all of a sudden,\nthose two plots were unfurling at once, and falling in love with Matthew\nreally helped me realize the enormity of what I lost when Aaron died. And just as importantly, it helped me realize\nthat my love for Aaron and my grief for Aaron, and my love for Matthew,\nare not opposing forces. They are just strands to the same thread. They're the same stuff. I'm ... what would my parents say? I'm not special. (Laughter) They had four kids,\nthey were like ... frankly. (Laughter) But I'm not, I'm not special. I know that, I'm fully aware that all day, every day,\nall around the world, terrible things are happening. All the time. Like I said, fun person. But terrible things are happening, people are experiencing deeply formative\nand traumatic losses every day. And as part of my job, this weird podcast that I have, I sometimes talk to people about the worst thing\nthat's ever happened to them. And sometimes, that's the loss\nof someone they love, sometimes days ago or weeks ago,\nyears ago, even decades ago. And these people that I interview, they haven't closed themselves\naround this loss and made it the center of their lives. They've lived, their worlds\nhave kept spinning. But they're talking to me,\na total stranger, about the person they love who has died, because these are the experiences that mark us and make us\njust as much as the joyful ones. And just as permanently. Long after you get your last sympathy card or your last hot dish. Like, we don't look\nat the people around us experiencing life's joys and wonders\nand tell them to \"move on,\" do we? We don't send a card that's like,\n\"Congratulations on your beautiful baby,\" and then, five years later, think like,\n\"Another birthday party? Get over it.\" (Laughter) Yeah, we get it, he's five. (Laughter) Wow. (Laughter) But grief is kind of one of those things, like, falling in love or having a baby\nor watching \"The Wire\" on HBO, where you don't get it\nuntil you get it, until you do it. And once you do it,\nonce it's your love or your baby, once it's your grief\nand your front row at the funeral, you get it. You understand what you're experiencing\nis not a moment in time, it's not a bone that will reset, but that you've been touched\nby something chronic. Something incurable. It's not fatal, but sometimes\ngrief feels like it could be. And if we can't prevent it in one another, what can we do? What can we do other than try\nto remind one another that some things can't be fixed, and not all wounds are meant to heal? We need each other to remember, to help each other remember, that grief is this multitasking emotion. That you can and will be sad, and happy;\nyou'll be grieving, and able to love in the same year or week, the same breath. We need to remember that a grieving person\nis going to laugh again and smile again. If they're lucky,\nthey'll even find love again. But yes, absolutely,\nthey're going to move forward. But that doesn't mean\nthat they've moved on. Thank you. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

It’s hard to believe that it’s a cousin of\nthe terrifying duddly or the hideous fuddly. They’re all members of the Wuddly species, and the process of adopting \nthem is deeply peculiar. It takes 100 eggs to make a single \nanimal in genus Wuddly. When 100 eggs are placed together \nin an incubator, they undergo egg fusion, and combine \nin the following way. Blue and purple combine to make red eggs. Red and blue combine to make purple eggs, and red and purple \ncombine to make blue eggs. The most plentiful eggs pair up first, and if two piles are even, an egg comes from one of them at random. They keep combining until \nthere’s just one left. If the final egg is blue, a Cuddly hatches out of it. Purple eggs give you Duddlies, and Red eggs give you Fuddlies. The incubator currently has 99 eggs in it. 23 are blue, 33 are purple, \nand 43 are red. You can begin the process of egg fusion\nby adding an egg of any color to the room. When all the eggs have combined\ninto a single egg, the creature that hatches will bond \nwith you on sight, which is why getting a Cuddly \nis so important. After all, you made a promise to your son. Which color egg should you add \nto the incubator to get a cuddly? Pause the video to figure it out \nfor yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It’s easy to get mixed up with all the\ncuddlies, duddlies, and fuddlies coming from different colored eggs. If we ignore how many total eggs\nof each color there are, and just look at the \nprocess of egg fusion, we might notice something that \nwill make this problem simpler. When two eggs fuse, the number of eggs of each of those \ncolors decreases by one, and the number of the third \ncolor increases by one. That means they all change parity, or evenness and oddness, \nat the same time. Right now all three piles are odd, \nbut you get to add an egg to one color, which means that it’ll be even \nand the other two will be odd. Whichever color you choose will always be the opposite parity \nof the other two piles: odd when they’re even and \neven when they’re odd, since every egg fusion flips each pile’s \nparity simultaneously. We want to end with 1 blue, 0 purple,\nand 0 red eggs, or odd, even, even. That means we want the blue egg pile \nto be the opposite parity of the other two piles \nat the start as well. So you add a blue egg into the room, and 99 egg fusions later, only a single blue egg remains. The Cuddly that hatches is sure to make \nyour 6-year-old as happy as can be.

{"page": 20, "lesson": 11, "title": "The golf ball that made golfers too good", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/yORw6jl9", "transcript": {"en": "This is the 13th hole at Augusta National Golf Club. And to reach it, you have to hit a series of shots around the corner from the tee. One to get down the fairway, and a few more to get around the corner and onto the green. But not if you're Bubba Watson. \"Bubba Watson with a driver.\" At the 2014 Masters Tournament, he did something remarkable. His drive sliced left, and into the woods, looking like a huge mistake. Until the announcers realized what Bubba was up to. That ball flew far enough to go over the trees and land right in front of the green. Bubba cut the corner. And that shot helped him win the tournament. But it also showed that golf might have a problem. Players like Bubba might be hitting the ball too far. Bernhard Langer is a pro golfer who had an average drive of 280 yards in 2018. That's 20 yards farther than what he was hitting when he was 30. And that jump is part of a much bigger trend. Since 1980, the average driving distance on the PGA Pro Tour has climbed over 30 yards. So the question is, what's causing this rise? The truth is, there are a lot of reasons why golfers are hitting the ball farther. They're stronger, their clubs are high-tech, and the courses are in better condition. But while all of these factors have had an effect, one particular thing has become a focus of conversation: The earliest golf balls were, likely, wooden, or \"Hairies,\" made with stitched fabric filled with...hair. Then came \"Featheries,\" made from leather filled with...feathers. And later, \"Gutties,\" made with ...  Maybe you've never heard of the gutta percha, a tropical tree species that provided the sap used to make gutty balls. Playing Gutties, golfers noticed that their older balls,  the ones beaten up with nicks and scratches, were flying farther than the new ones. So they started carving designs into Gutties to get more distance. And, experimenting with different patterns, golfers realized that dimples work best. Dimpled balls fly farther because air, coming into contact with an uneven surface, creates a protective layer of turbulence around the golf ball. And that creates a smaller wake, that has less drag on the ball. But remember this chart? Dimples were around way before this line started rising, so they don't really explain what's going on here. And I mean right here. See this jump? It's the steepest part of this trendline. Something caused this, and it wasn't dimples. It was this: The golf ball that revolutionized the sport. I know what you're thinking — this looks like any other golf ball. But not when you look on the inside. So, for about 100 years before the Pro V1, the standard golf ball had been a \"wound ball.\" The inside is a rubber band, wound around a core, and sometimes filled with liquid, which you can see if you cut one open, like golfer Rick Shiels. But cutting open a Pro V1, you can see what makes this ball different. It's the solid, multi-layered core.  Before the Pro V1 and balls like it, players had to choose: between a solid-core ball that's good for distance, or a wound ball that's better for accuracy. But a multi-layered ball can do both. Its rigid core helps it fly far for distance, and the flexible outer layers allow a golfer to control spin when hitting closer to the hole. Before 2000, nearly all players hit wound balls. But afterwards, nearly all pro players in the US Open had switched to hitting solid multi-layer balls like the Pro V1. And that year was the year that the average driving distance shot up six yards. \"Unusual and concerning\" is how a 2017 report described the rise in driving distance for professional players. Hitting the ball too far means golfers can fly the ball over obstacles designed to make the game difficult. And that's making some courses obsolete. Especially older ones, like Oakmont Country Club, where holes designed in another era are being overpowered by modern players. Now, officials are considering what they can do to limit distance. Making golf balls bigger would increase drag, and a heavier ball would fall out of the air more quickly. But adjusting dimpling, or rolling back innovations that made the Pro V1 successful, like layering and materials, could also reduce the flight of golf balls, and solve the problem. However, not everyone's happy about this idea. \"We own our manufacturing process, we own our technology, and we own our responsibility to the end-user.\" As this epic marketing video shows, Titleist invests a lot in making golf balls. And for ball manufacturers, any little change to production would cost them a lot of money. But they probably shouldn't be too worried. The truth is, golf has been having a version of this debate for nearly a hundred years, and nothing's been settled yet. Debating the flight of the ball started a long time ago, with people asking \"does it go too far?\" as far back as 1936. And in the end, maybe it just doesn't even matter. Remember the 13th hole at Augusta? That got fixed. The club just bought the land behind the tee box, in order to pull it back, and make it farther to hit a drive over the corner. No matter what kind of ball you use."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Since 1980, how much has the average drive in the PGA tour changed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "it has decreased by 30 feet"}, {"label": "B", "text": "it has not changed at all"}, {"label": "C", "text": "it has increased by 30 yards"}, {"label": "D", "text": "it has increased by 30 feet"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The reason for this increase in drive distance is", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "better clubs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "better course conditions"}, {"label": "C", "text": "golfers are in better shape"}, {"label": "D", "text": "golf balls have changed"}, {"label": "E", "text": "all of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What did golfers notice about gutties?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "those that were heavier, flew farther"}, {"label": "B", "text": "those that were lighter, flew farther"}, {"label": "C", "text": "those that were smooth, flew farther"}, {"label": "D", "text": "those that were scratched and dented, flew farther"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "When comparing a solid golf ball to a wound golf ball, what are the noticeable differences when hit?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "the solid core ball travels farther, the wound ball travels more accurately"}, {"label": "B", "text": "the solid core ball travels more accurately, the wound ball travels farther"}, {"label": "C", "text": "there is little or no difference"}, {"label": "D", "text": "the solid core ball travels better in warmer weather"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "As the use of multilayered balls increased, what happened?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "golfers became less accurate and less able to hit greater distances"}, {"label": "B", "text": "golfers were able to play more in rainy weather"}, {"label": "C", "text": "golfers average driving distance suddenly increased"}, {"label": "D", "text": "all of the above are great answers"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
{"page": 20, "lesson": 12, "title": "You aren't at the mercy of your emotions - Lisa Feldman", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/J7VBZmKf", "transcript": {"en": "My research lab sits about a mile\nfrom where several bombs exploded during the Boston Marathon in 2013. The surviving bomber,\nDzhokhar Tsarnaev of Chechnya, was tried, convicted\nand sentenced to death. Now, when a jury has to make the decision between life in prison\nand the death penalty, they base their decision largely\non whether or not the defendant feels remorseful for his actions. Tsarnaev spoke words of apology, but when jurors looked at his face, all they saw was a stone-faced stare. Now, Tsarnaev is guilty,\nthere's no doubt about that. He murdered and maimed innocent people, and I'm not here to debate that. My heart goes out\nto all the people who suffered. But as a scientist, I have to tell you that jurors do not\nand cannot detect remorse or any other emotion in anybody ever. Neither can I, and neither can you, and that's because emotions\nare not what we think they are. They are not universally\nexpressed and recognized. They are not hardwired brain reactions that are uncontrollable. We have misunderstood\nthe nature of emotion for a very long time, and understanding what emotions really are\nhas important consequences for all of us. I have studied emotions as a scientist\nfor the past 25 years, and in my lab, we have probed human faces\nby measuring electrical signals that cause your facial muscles to contract\nto make facial expressions. We have scrutinized\nthe human body in emotion. We have analyzed\nhundreds of physiology studies involving thousands of test subjects. We've scanned hundreds of brains, and examined every\nbrain imaging study on emotion that has been published\nin the past 20 years. And the results of all of this research\nare overwhelmingly consistent. It may feel to you\nlike your emotions are hardwired and they just trigger and happen to you, but they don't. You might believe that your brain\nis prewired with emotion circuits, that you're born with emotion\ncircuits, but you're not. In fact, none of us in this room\nhave emotion circuits in our brain. In fact, no brain on this planet\ncontains emotion circuits. So what are emotions, really? Well, strap on your seat belt,\nbecause ... emotions are guesses. They are guesses that your brain\nconstructs in the moment where billions of brain cells\nare working together, and you have more control\nover those guesses than you might imagine that you do. Now, if that sounds preposterous to you,\nor, you know, kind of crazy, I'm right there with you, because frankly,\nif I hadn't seen the evidence for myself, decades of evidence for myself, I am fairly sure\nthat I wouldn't believe it either. But the bottom line is that emotions\nare not built into your brain at birth. They are just built. To see what I mean, have a look at this. Right now, your brain\nis working like crazy. Your neurons are firing like mad\ntrying to make meaning out of this so that you see something\nother than black and white blobs. Your brain is sifting\nthrough a lifetime of experience, making thousands of guesses\nat the same time, weighing the probabilities, trying to answer the question, \"What is this most like?\" not \"What is it?\" but \"What is this most like\nin my past experience?\" And this is all happening\nin the blink of an eye. Now if your brain is still struggling\nto find a good match and you still see black and white blobs, then you are in a state\ncalled \"experiential blindness,\" and I am going to cure you\nof your blindness. This is my favorite part.\nAre you ready to be cured? (Cheers) All right. Here we go. (Gasps) All right. So now many of you see a snake, and why is that? Because as your brain is sifting\nthrough your past experience, there's new knowledge there, the knowledge that came\nfrom the photograph. And what's really cool is that that knowledge which you just\nacquired moments ago is changing how you experience\nthese blobs right now. So your brain is constructing\nthe image of a snake where there is no snake, and this kind of a hallucination is what neuroscientists like me\ncall \"predictions.\" Predictions are basically\nthe way your brain works. It's business as usual for your brain. Predictions are the basis\nof every experience that you have. They are the basis\nof every action that you take. In fact, predictions are what allow you\nto understand the words that I'm speaking as they come out of my -- Audience: Mouth.\nLisa Feldman Barrett: Mouth. Exactly. Predictions are primal. They help us to make sense\nof the world in a quick and efficient way. So your brain does not react to the world. Using past experience, your brain predicts and constructs your experience of the world. The way that we see emotions in others\nare deeply rooted in predictions. So to us, it feels like\nwe just look at someone's face, and we just read the emotion\nthat's there in their facial expressions the way that we would read\nwords on a page. But actually, under the hood,\nyour brain is predicting. It's using past experience\nbased on similar situations to try to make meaning. This time, you're not\nmaking meaning of blobs, you're making meaning of facial movements like the curl of a lip\nor the raise of an eyebrow. And that stone-faced stare? That might be someone\nwho is a remorseless killer, but a stone-faced stare might also mean that someone is stoically\naccepting defeat, which is in fact what Chechen culture\nprescribes for someone in Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's situation. So the lesson here is that emotions that you seem\nto detect in other people actually come in part\nfrom what's inside your own head. And this is true in the courtroom, but it's also true in the classroom, in the bedroom, and in the boardroom. And so here's my concern: tech companies\nwhich shall remain nameless ... well, maybe not. You know, Google, Facebook -- (Laughter) are spending millions of research dollars\nto build emotion-detection systems, and they are fundamentally\nasking the wrong question, because they're trying to detect\nemotions in the face and the body, but emotions aren't in your face and body. Physical movements\nhave no intrinsic emotional meaning. We have to make them meaningful. A human or something else\nhas to connect them to the context, and that makes them meaningful. That's how we know\nthat a smile might mean sadness and a cry might mean happiness, and a stoic, still face might mean that you are angrily plotting\nthe demise of your enemy. Now, if I haven't already\ngone out on a limb, I'll just edge out on that limb\na little further and tell you that the way that you experience\nyour own emotion is exactly the same process. Your brain is basically\nmaking predictions, guesses, that it's constructing in the moment with billions of neurons working together. Now your brain does come\nprewired to make some feelings, simple feelings that come\nfrom the physiology of your body. So when you're born, you can make feelings\nlike calmness and agitation, excitement, comfort, discomfort. But these simple feelings\nare not emotions. They're actually with you\nevery waking moment of your life. They are simple summaries\nof what's going on inside your body, kind of like a barometer. But they have very little detail, and you need that detail\nto know what to do next. What do you about these feelings? And so how does your brain\ngive you that detail? Well, that's what predictions are. Predictions link\nthe sensations in your body that give you these simple feelings with what's going on\naround you in the world so that you know what to do. And sometimes, those constructions are emotions. So for example, if you were\nto walk into a bakery, your brain might predict\nthat you will encounter the delicious aroma of freshly baked\nchocolate chip cookies. I know my brain would predict the delicious aroma of freshly baked\nchocolate cookies. And our brains might cause\nour stomachs to churn a little bit, to prepare for eating those cookies. And if we are correct, if in fact some cookies\nhave just come out of the oven, then our brains will\nhave constructed hunger, and we are prepared\nto munch down those cookies and digest them in a very efficient way, meaning that we can eat a lot of them, which would be a really good thing. You guys are not laughing enough.\nI'm totally serious. (Laughter) But here's the thing. That churning stomach, if it occurs in a different situation, it can have a completely\ndifferent meaning. So if your brain were to predict\na churning stomach in, say, a hospital room\nwhile you're waiting for test results, then your brain will be constructing dread or worry or anxiety, and it might cause you to, maybe, wring your hands or take a deep breath or even cry. Right? Same physical sensation,\nsame churning stomach, different experience. And so the lesson here is that emotions which seem\nto happen to you are actually made by you. You are not at the mercy\nof mythical emotion circuits which are buried deep inside\nsome ancient part of your brain. You have more control over your emotions than you think you do. I don't mean that you can\njust snap your fingers and change how you feel the way\nthat you would change your clothes, but your brain is wired so that if you change the ingredients\nthat your brain uses to make emotion, then you can transform\nyour emotional life. So if you change those ingredients today, you're basically teaching your brain\nhow to predict differently tomorrow, and this is what I call\nbeing the architect of your experience. So here's an example. All of us have had a nervous feeling\nbefore a test, right? But some people experience\ncrippling anxiety before a test. They have test anxiety. Based on past experiences of taking tests, their brains predict\na hammering heartbeat, sweaty hands, so much so that they are unable\nto actually take the test. They don't perform well, and sometimes they not only fail courses\nbut they actually might fail college. But here's the thing: a hammering heartbeat\nis not necessarily anxiety. It could be that your body\nis preparing to do battle and ace that test ... or, you know, give a talk in front of hundreds of people\non a stage where you're being filmed. (Laughter) I'm serious. (Laughter) And research shows\nthat when students learn to make this kind\nof energized determination instead of anxiety, they perform better on tests. And that determination seeds their brain\nto predict differently in the future so that they can get their butterflies\nflying in formation. And if they do that often enough, they not only can pass a test but it will be easier for them\nto pass their courses, and they might even finish college, which has a huge impact\non their future earning potential. So I call this emotional\nintelligence in action. Now you can cultivate\nthis emotional intelligence yourself and use it in your everyday life. So just, you know, imagine waking up in the morning. I'm sure you've had\nthis experience. I know I have. You wake up and as you're emerging\ninto consciousness, you feel this horrible dread, you know, this real wretchedness, and immediately, your mind starts to race. You start to think about\nall the crap that you have to do at work and you have that mountain of email which you will never\ndig yourself out of ever, the phone calls you have to return, and that important meeting across town, and you're going to have to fight traffic, you'll be late picking your kids up, your dog is sick, and what\nare you going to make for dinner? Oh my God. What is wrong with your life? What is wrong with my life? (Laughter) That mind racing is prediction. Your brain is searching\nto find an explanation for those sensations in your body\nthat you experience as wretchedness, just like you did with the blobby image. So your brain is trying to explain\nwhat caused those sensations so that you know what to do about them. But those sensations might not be an indication\nthat anything is wrong with your life. They might have a purely physical cause. Maybe you're tired. Maybe you didn't sleep enough. Maybe you're hungry. Maybe you're dehydrated. The next time that you feel\nintense distress, ask yourself: Could this have a purely physical cause? Is it possible that you can transform emotional suffering\ninto just mere physical discomfort? Now I am not suggesting to you that you can just perform\na couple of Jedi mind tricks and talk yourself out of being depressed or anxious or any kind\nof serious condition. But I am telling you that you have more control\nover your emotions than you might imagine, and that you have the capacity to turn down the dial\non emotional suffering and its consequences for your life by learning how to construct\nyour experiences differently. And all of us can do this and with a little practice,\nwe can get really good at it, like driving. At first, it takes a lot of effort, but eventually it becomes\npretty automatic. Now I don't know about you, but I find this to be\na really empowering and inspiring message, and the fact that it's backed up\nby decades of research makes me also happy as a scientist. But I have to also warn you\nthat it does come with some fine print, because more control\nalso means more responsibility. If you are not at the mercy\nof mythical emotion circuits which are buried deep\ninside your brain somewhere and which trigger automatically, then who's responsible, who is responsible when you behave badly? You are. Not because you're culpable\nfor your emotions, but because the actions\nand the experiences that you make today become your brain's\npredictions for tomorrow. Sometimes we are responsible for something not because we're to blame but because we're the only ones\nwho can change it. Now responsibility is a big word. It's so big, in fact, that sometimes people feel the need\nto resist the scientific evidence that emotions are built and not built in. The idea that we are responsible\nfor our own emotions seems very hard to swallow. But what I'm suggesting to you\nis you don't have to choke on that idea. You just take a deep breath, maybe get yourself\na glass of water if you need to, and embrace it. Embrace that responsibility, because it is the path\nto a healthier body, a more just and informed legal system, and a more flexible\nand potent emotional life. Thank you.

Painted with squirrel-hair brushes \non vellum or parchment by monks, nuns, and urban craftspeople, these bizarre images populate the \nmargins of the most prized books from the Middle Ages. Their illustrations often tell a second \nstory as rich as the text itself. Some images appear in many \ndifferent illuminated manuscripts, and often reinforce the religious \ncontent of the books they decorated. For example, a porcupine picking \nup fruit on its spines could represent the devil stealing \nthe fruits of faith-- or Christ taking up the sins of mankind. Medieval lore stated that a hunter \ncould only capture a unicorn when it lay its horn in \nthe lap of a virgin, so a unicorn could symbolize \neither sexual temptation or Christ being captured by his enemies. Rabbits, meanwhile, could represent \nhuman’s lustful natures— and could redeem themselves through \nattempts to make sacred music despite their failings. All of these references would have \nbeen familiar to medieval Europeans from other art forms and oral tradition, though some have grown more \nmysterious over the centuries. Today, no one can say for sure what the common \nmotif of a knight fighting a snail means— or why the knight so often \nappears to be losing. The snail might be a symbol of the \ninevitability of death, which defeats even the strongest knights. Or it could represent humility, and a \nknight’s need to vanquish his own pride. Many illuminated manuscripts were \ncopies of religious or classical texts, and the bookmakers incorporated their \nown ideas and opinions in illustrations. The butt tuba, for example, was likely shorthand to \nexpress disapproval with-- or add an ironic spin to--\nthe action in the text. Illuminations could also be used to \nmake subversive political commentary. The text of the \"Smithfield Decretals\" details the Church’s laws and \npunishments for lawbreakers. But the margins show a fox being \nhanged by geese, a possible allusion to the common people \nturning on their powerful oppressors. In the \"Chronica Majora,\" Matthew Paris summarized a \nscandal of his day, in which the Welsh prince Griffin plummeted to his death \nfrom the tower of London. Some believed the prince fell, \nParis wrote, while others thought he was pushed. He added his own take in the margins, which show the prince falling to his death while trying to escape on a rope \nmade of bed-sheets. Some margins told stories of \na more personal nature. \"The Luttrell Psalter,\" a book of psalms and prayers commissioned \nby Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, shows a young woman having her hair done, while a young man catches a bird in a net. The shaved patch on his \nhead is growing out, indicating that he is a clergyman \nneglecting his duties. This alludes to a family scandal where a young cleric ran away with Sir \nGeoffrey’s daughter Elizabeth. The family’s personal spiritual advisor \nlikely painted it into the book to remind his clients of their failings and encourage their spiritual development. Some artists even painted themselves \ninto the manuscripts. The opening image of Christine de \nPisan’s collected works shows de Pisan presenting \nthe book to the Queen of France. The queen was so impressed by de Pisan's \nprevious work that she commissioned her own copy. Such royal patronage enabled her to establish her own \npublishing house in Paris. The tradition of illuminated manuscripts \nlasted for over a thousand years. The books were created by individuals or \nteams for uses as wide-ranging as private prayer aids, service books \nin churches, textbooks, and protective talismans to \ntake into battle. Across all this variation, those tricky little drawings \nin the margins are a unique window into the \nminds of medieval artists."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What sort of people made illuminated manuscripts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Monks and other religious personnel"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Authors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Craftspeople in towns"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Women"}, {"label": "E", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "Which of these animals is sometimes found in the margins of manuscripts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Monkeys"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rabbits"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Snails"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Who owned illuminated manuscripts in the Middle Ages?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only the most royal families"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Monks and priests"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Everyone except peasants"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lawyers"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What sorts of book could have illumination it the margins?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Books containing legal and financial documents"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Magazines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prayerbooks or ‘Books of Hours’"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Bible"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What could snails represent in medieval art?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Love"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Death"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Indigestion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Greed"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 20, "lesson": 14, "title": "Turbulence: one of the great unsolved mysteries of physics - Tomás Chor", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/turbulence-one-of-the-great-unsolved-mysteries-of-physics-tomas-chor", "transcript": {"en": "You’re on an airplane \nwhen you feel a sudden jolt. Outside your window nothing \nseems to be happening, yet the plane continues to rattle \nyou and your fellow passengers as it passes through turbulent air\nin the atmosphere. Although it may not comfort \nyou to hear it, this phenomenon is one of the \nprevailing mysteries of physics. After more than a century \nof studying turbulence, we’ve only come up with a few \nanswers for how it works and affects the world around us. And yet, turbulence is ubiquitous, springing up in virtually any system \nthat has moving fluids. That includes the airflow \nin your respiratory tract. The blood moving through your arteries. And the coffee in your cup, \nas you stir it. Clouds are governed by turbulence, as are waves crashing along the shore \nand the gusts of plasma in our sun. Understanding precisely how this \nphenomenon works would have a bearing on so many \naspects of our lives. Here’s what we do know. Liquids and gases usually have \ntwo types of motion: a laminar flow, which is stable \nand smooth; and a turbulent flow, which is composed \nof seemingly unorganized swirls. Imagine an incense stick. The laminar flow of unruffled smoke \nat the base is steady and easy to predict. Closer to the top, however, the smoke accelerates, becomes unstable, and the pattern of movement changes\nto something chaotic. That’s turbulence in action, and turbulent flows have certain\ncharacteristics in common. Firstly, turbulence is always chaotic. That’s different from being random. Rather, this means that turbulence \nis very sensitive to disruptions. A little nudge one way or the other will eventually turn into \ncompletely different results. That makes it nearly impossible \nto predict what will happen, even with a lot of information \nabout the current state of a system. Another important characteristic of \nturbulence is the different scales of motion \nthat these flows display. Turbulent flows have many \ndifferently-sized whirls called eddies, which are like vortices of \ndifferent sizes and shapes. All those differently-sized eddies \ninteract with each other, breaking up to become smaller and smaller until all that movement is \ntransformed into heat, in a process called the “energy cascade.\" So that’s how we recognize turbulence– but why does it happen? In every flowing liquid or gas there \nare two opposing forces: inertia and viscosity. Inertia is the tendency of fluids \nto keep moving, which causes instability. Viscosity works against disruption, making the flow laminar instead. In thick fluids such as honey, viscosity almost always wins. Less viscous substances like water or air \nare more prone to inertia, which creates instabilities that \ndevelop into turbulence. We measure where a flow falls \non that spectrum with something called the Reynolds number, which is the ratio between a flow’s \ninertia and its viscosity. The higher the Reynolds number, the more likely it is that \nturbulence will occur. Honey being poured into a cup, \nfor example, has a Reynolds number of about 1. The same set up with water has a Reynolds \nnumber that’s closer to 10,000. The Reynolds number is useful for \nunderstanding simple scenarios, but it’s ineffective in many situations. For example, the motion of the atmosphere\nis significantly influenced by factors including gravity and the \nearth’s rotation. Or take relatively simple things \nlike the drag on buildings and cars. We can model those thanks to many \nexperiments and empirical evidence. But physicists want to be able to predict \nthem through physical laws and equations as well as we can model the orbits \nof planets or electromagnetic fields. Most scientists think that getting there \nwill rely on statistics and increased computing power. Extremely high-speed computer simulations \nof turbulent flows could help us identify patterns that could\nlead to a theory that organizes and unifies predictions\nacross different situations. Other scientists think that the phenomenon\nis so complex that such a full-fledged theory \nisn’t ever going to be possible. Hopefully we’ll reach a breakthrough, because a true understanding of turbulence\ncould have huge positive impacts. That would include more \nefficient wind farms; the ability to better prepare for \ncatastrophic weather events; or even the power to manipulate \nhurricanes away. And, of course, smoother rides \nfor millions of airline passengers."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Reynolds number quantifies the ratio between forces due to ____ and ____.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Inertia, viscosity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gravity, viscosity"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Gravity, rotation"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rotation, viscosity"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What are the two types of motion exhibited by liquids and gases?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Laminar and turbulent"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Laminar and excited"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Turbulent and chaotic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Chaotic and random"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the energy cascade?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The small motions that emerge when water falls from high to low places"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The energy dissipated whenever a gust of wind hits an airplane and causes turbulence"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The transfer of energy from large to small eddies in the flow"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The energy of a gas or liquid as it moves"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "“____ is an example of a laminar flow, while _____ is an example of a turbulent one.”", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Water flowing from a tap; air inside your lungs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Honey being poured into a cup; air inside your lungs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A cup of stirring coffee; honey being poured into a cup"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Air in the atmosphere; waves breaking on the beach"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What of the following can we say about turbulence?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It’s very frequent, but unimportant."}, {"label": "B", "text": "It’s hard to find it in our daily lives."}, {"label": "C", "text": "It is always random."}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is always chaotic."}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

One-by-one, they will fall prey to the remarkable, \npredatory antics of... a carnivorous plant. Around the world there are more than \n600 plant species that supplement a regular \ndiet of sunlight, water, and soil with insects, microbes, \nor even frogs and rats. Scientists believe that carnivory in \nplants evolved separately at least six times on our planet, suggesting that this flesh-munching \nadaptation holds a major benefit for plants. Carnivorous plants tend to grow in places \nwith highly acidic soil, which is poor in crucial nutrients \nlike nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. In these hostile conditions, plants that are able to lure, trap, \nand digest prey have an advantage over those that rely \non soil for their nutrients. Take this inhospitable bog, where pitcher plants reign supreme. Drawn to the pitcher’s vivid colors \nand alluring scent, the fly closes in and slurps its nectar. But this pitcher species has an ingredient\ncalled coniine in its nectar, a powerful narcotic to insects. As the coniine takes effect, the fly grows sluggish, stumbles, \nand falls down the funnel into a pool of liquid at the base, where he drowns. Enzymes and bacteria in the liquid slowly\nbreak his body down into microscopic particles the pitcher \nplant can consume through its leaves. Occasionally, larger prey also tumbles into the \nfatal funnel of the pitcher plant. The second victim faces off with the \nsticky sundew plant. The sundew’s tiny leaves are equipped with\na viscous secretion called mucilage. The ant is swiftly trapped in this goo. As she struggles, enzymes begin \nto digest her body. Special tentacles sense her movement \nand curl around her, clenching her in their suffocating grip. Once she asphyxiates, which can happen in under an hour, the tentacles unfurl again \nto snare their next victim. Two down, four to go. The next target meets his end underground, in the coils of the corkscrew plant. He enters the roots through a tiny slit\nin search of food. But inside, he quickly loses his way \nthrough the tangled labyrinth. A forest of curved hairs \nprevents his escape, guiding him into a central chamber\nwith flesh-digesting enzymes and deadly low levels of oxygen. In the murky depths of a nearby pond, a tadpole unwittingly swims into the path\nof the bladderwort, the speediest of all carnivorous plants. She treads on the bladderwort’s trigger, and in milliseconds, a trapdoor swings open and sucks her in. Trapped half in and half out, she struggles to free herself while the part of her body inside \nthe plant gets digested. Over the next few hours, her writhing sets the trap off repeatedly, each time bringing her deeper \ninto the plant to be digested alive bit by bit. Meanwhile, this beetle is bewitched by \nsweet-smelling nectar. The scent draws him closer and closer until he lands on the leaves of the \nworld’s most infamous carnivorous plant. His landing triggers tiny hairs on the \nsurface of the leaves, and the jaws of the venus fly trap \nsnap shut around him. The spikes interlock to seal his fate. Once closed, the leaves act like an external stomach\nthat digests the beetle’s soft tissues. When they open again a few days later, only the dry husk of his \nexoskeleton remains. The mayfly is the last creature standing. As she approaches the butterwort plant, she heads for the flowers that wave high\nabove the plant’s globs of adhesive goo. She alights on the petals, drinks the \nnectar, and takes off unscathed. These long flower stalks keep certain \ninsects away from the carnivore’s traps— a way of separating pollinators from food.

Yeah, you heard me right. In fact, as you're made of \n30-ish trillion cells, and each of those have their own task, you're a robot made of trillions\nof mini robots- you are a mega-meat-bot! And your mission, for the past 4 billion \nyears or so- and for as long as you keep \nplaying this game of life- is to safeguard the code. To duplicate it. \nTo pass it on. The thing is, you're rubbish at \ncopying your own code. Every time it's copied, errors crop up. Not good when an error makes \na robot worse at surviving, but sometimes a mistake \nhelps them survive... and they pass that glitch in the code on- that's evolution in a nutshell, right? Which means you're not the result \nof some fancy design, I'm afraid. You're a result of billions of \nyears of bad copies. Go you. Another reason you're not totally awesome is because that megabot of yours \noften breaks down. Fortunately, cardiologists, immunologists, \nmicrobiologists- all the \"ists\"- have spent centuries figuring out \nour sensors and wiring so if something does go wrong, \nthey can usually fix it. Where they struggle, though, is when \nthe machinery turns on itself- when a copying error leads a cell \nto start dividing uncontrollably, to grow and multiply into a tumor. That's cancer. And sadly, even with the might \nof our modern medicine, some cancers evade treatment. But this is where a new band of \nbiologists step into the story: The \"Synthetic Biologists.\" These biohackers are mashing up science, \nmedicine and engineering to rewrite the code and fix \nthe un-fixable. Biohackers are going into a \npatient's genetic code and reprogramming their own immune system to recognize cancer cells \nand destroy them. It's called CAR T-cell therapy, \nand it's awesome. See, you're constantly under \nattack by pathogens- single-celled bacteria, viruses and fungi. Despite deciding, back in the day, to stay solo and not 'avengers assemble' \nlike you did, those pathogens see you, in all \nyour mega-meat-bot glory, as a fortress ripe for the plundering. Thankfully, you've got a security team \nin place to battle these invaders- your immune system- and some of it's top guards are \nyour white blood cells. They trawl the darkness \nthat is your inner space, checking the IDs of any cells they pass... although they're not name badges, but rather protein fragments on \nthe cell's surface called antigens. There are two types of these guards: \nT-cells and B-cells. T-cells check those antigen IDs \nusing special claws- receptors that lock with a \nparticular antigen. If they find a match, they attach and \nthey release toxic chemicals that burst open the \ninvading cell's membrane. Their B-cell workmates create antibodies- loads of small proteins, little claws that latch perfectly onto \na particular antigen, marking them for destruction. These two comrades have got your back and your immune system is brilliant at \nspotting and fighting pathogens that invade from outside. However, they're not so good at spotting your \nown cells that have gone rogue. The antigens on cancerous cells \ndon't look weird, they look a lot like your own cells, and the T's and B's aren't \nprogrammed to attack them. The usual way to deal with cancer is \nto try to cut the tumor out, or turn to radiotherapy and \nthen chemotherapy to destroy or block the \ngrowth of cancer cells, but if it's a blood cancer, if it's \nfloating around your whole body, you can't do that. And if the blood cancer actually starts in\nyour white blood cells- those key guards in your immune system- you'll really struggle to spot it. That's the case with acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia, and that's where CAR T-cell therapy \nis kicking butt. The biohackers are reprogramming a \npatient's own immune system to recognize particular antigens- those \nparticular protein fragments- on the cancer cells. To do it, you first need millions \nof a patient's T-cells Then, to get a T-cell to do \nsomething different, you need to replace its normal \ncode with something new, something you've designed. What synthetic biologists can now do\nwith DNA is super cool- they use a computer to put together \ntheir own sequences of bases- the chemical letters that spell \nout the DNA- then they model what that new genetic \ncode will do on a computer and then make those sequences \non a DNA printer- yeah, that's a thing!- printing not with ink, or with a plastic \npolymer like in a 3D printer, but with those fundamental \nbuilding blocks of life, with those A's and C's and T's and G's. The new code they designed for a \nT-cell has 3 key instructions: 1. It tells it how to recognize \nand kill a cancer cell. More specifically, how to modify an antibody- what the B-cells make to latch \nonto a target antigen. The antibody is modified to \nmake a new receptor that can detect the particular antigens \non the specific cancer. 2. It tells it to make copies of itself \nwhen it finds that cancer cell and 3. It tells it to survive \nin the patient's body. To get this new code into \nthe patient's T-cells, you use a vector- it's something that will easily \ninfect the T-cell and carry that bespoke DNA in with it. And voila! \nOne CAR T-cell. The name comes from a fire-breathing \nmonster from Ancient Greece, that had a lion's head, a goat's \nbody and a serpent's tail. It was called \"Chimera\"-\na name that has now come to be used for something that contains two or \nmore different types of tissues or cells. As this newly engineered cell's genetic \ncode is part T-cell, part antibody, it's a \"C\"himera and it goes in search \nof the cancer's \"A\"ntigen using its new \"R\"eceptor. Before you put the multiplied up \nT-cells back into the patient, you give them a mild dose of chemotherapy \nto wipe their existing T-cells. Then you simply reinsert the \nnow modified T-cells- the CAR T-cells- and they follow their normal DNA \nprogramming to move and search. However, thanks to their new \nbutt-kicking code, they've changed what they're looking for: they're now on a mission to find the \ncancerous cells and destroy them. Unlike conventional chemical-based drugs that get used up or excreted from \nthe body pretty quickly, CAR T-cells are living drugs that stay in \nthe patient's bloodstream for years. That's a huge pro. The flip side is that they're expensive- each CAR T-cell treatment is \nbespoke to the patient- and it's more difficult to get them to\nwork with common cancers like breast or lung, because you need a \nspecific antigen on the cancer cells for the CAR T-cell to target- and it's much easier to find \nthat in blood cancers. It's still early days, though, and there's an exciting \nfuture for CAR T-cell therapy. Researchers like Dr. Martin Pule \nand his team at UCL, are working on improving the leukemia \nand lymphoma treatments even further, and there's recently been some \npromising work on solid cancers. Thanks to CAR T-cell therapy, the survival rate for B acute\nlymphoblastic leukemia has improved hugely -nearly all patients go into remission- which means that leukemia cannot \nbe detected anymore- and most patients stay in remission. Biohacking is here, and it can reprogram your own \ngenetic code to enable your mega-meat-bot to do things it's never been \nable to do before!"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 20, "lesson": 17, "title": "How childhood trauma affects health across a lifetime - Nadine Burke Harris", "category": "Public Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/eczPoVp6", "transcript": {"en": "In the mid-'90s, the CDC and Kaiser Permanente discovered an exposure\nthat dramatically increased the risk for seven out of 10 of the leading\ncauses of death in the United States. In high doses, it affects\nbrain development, the immune system, hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA\nis read and transcribed. Folks who are exposed in very high doses have triple the lifetime risk\nof heart disease and lung cancer and a 20-year difference\nin life expectancy. And yet, doctors today are not trained\nin routine screening or treatment. Now, the exposure I'm talking about is\nnot a pesticide or a packaging chemical. It's childhood trauma. Okay. What kind of trauma\nam I talking about here? I'm not talking about failing a test\nor losing a basketball game. I am talking about threats\nthat are so severe or pervasive that they literally get under our skin\nand change our physiology: things like abuse or neglect, or growing up with a parent \nwho struggles with mental illness or substance dependence. Now, for a long time, I viewed these things in the way \nI was trained to view them, either as a social problem --\nrefer to social services -- or as a mental health problem --\nrefer to mental health services. And then something happened\nto make me rethink my entire approach. When I finished my residency, I wanted to go someplace\nwhere I felt really needed, someplace where I could make a difference. So I came to work for\nCalifornia Pacific Medical Center, one of the best private hospitals\nin Northern California, and together, we opened a clinic\nin Bayview-Hunters Point, one of the poorest, most underserved\nneighborhoods in San Francisco. Now, prior to that point, there had been only\none pediatrician in all of Bayview to serve more than 10,000 children, so we hung a shingle, and we were able\nto provide top-quality care regardless of ability to pay. It was so cool. We targeted\nthe typical health disparities: access to care, immunization rates,\nasthma hospitalization rates, and we hit all of our numbers. We felt very proud of ourselves. But then I started noticing\na disturbing trend. A lot of kids were being\nreferred to me for ADHD, or Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder, but when I actually did\na thorough history and physical, what I found was that\nfor most of my patients, I couldn't make a diagnosis of ADHD. Most of the kids I was seeing\nhad experienced such severe trauma that it felt like something else\nwas going on. Somehow I was missing something important. Now, before I did my residency,\nI did a master's degree in public health, and one of the things that they teach you\nin public health school is that if you're a doctor and you see 100 kids\nthat all drink from the same well, and 98 of them develop diarrhea, you can go ahead\nand write that prescription for dose after dose\nafter dose of antibiotics, or you can walk over and say,\n\"What the hell is in this well?\" So I began reading everything that\nI could get my hands on about how exposure to adversity affects the developing brains\nand bodies of children. And then one day,\nmy colleague walked into my office, and he said, \"Dr. Burke,\nhave you seen this?\" In his hand was a copy\nof a research study called the Adverse Childhood\nExperiences Study. That day changed my clinical practice\nand ultimately my career. The Adverse Childhood Experiences Study is something that everybody\nneeds to know about. It was done by Dr. Vince Felitti at Kaiser\nand Dr. Bob Anda at the CDC, and together, they asked 17,500 adults\nabout their history of exposure to what they called \"adverse \nchildhood experiences,\" or ACEs. Those include physical, emotional,\nor sexual abuse; physical or emotional neglect; parental mental illness,\nsubstance dependence, incarceration; parental separation or divorce; or domestic violence. For every yes, you would get\na point on your ACE score. And then what they did was they correlated these ACE scores\nagainst health outcomes. What they found was striking. Two things: Number one, ACEs are incredibly common. Sixty-seven percent of the population\nhad at least one ACE, and 12.6 percent, one in eight,\nhad four or more ACEs. The second thing that they found was that there was\na dose-response relationship between ACEs and health outcomes: the higher your ACE score,\nthe worse your health outcomes. For a person with an ACE score\nof four or more, their relative risk of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease was two and a half times that\nof someone with an ACE score of zero. For hepatitis, it was also\ntwo and a half times. For depression, it was\nfour and a half times. For suicidality, it was 12 times. A person with an ACE score\nof seven or more had triple the lifetime risk\nof lung cancer and three and a half times the risk\nof ischemic heart disease, the number one killer\nin the United States of America. Well, of course this makes sense. Some people looked at this data\nand they said, \"Come on. You have a rough childhood,\nyou're more likely to drink and smoke and do all these things\nthat are going to ruin your health. This isn't science.\nThis is just bad behavior.\" It turns out this is exactly\nwhere the science comes in. We now understand\nbetter than we ever have before how exposure to early adversity affects the developing brains\nand bodies of children. It affects areas like\nthe nucleus accumbens, the pleasure and reward\ncenter of the brain that is implicated\nin substance dependence. It inhibits the prefrontal cortex, which is necessary for impulse control\nand executive function, a critical area for learning. And on MRI scans, we see measurable differences\nin the amygdala, the brain's fear response center. So there are real neurologic reasons why folks exposed\nto high doses of adversity are more likely to engage\nin high-risk behavior, and that's important to know. But it turns out that even if you don't\nengage in any high-risk behavior, you're still more likely\nto develop heart disease or cancer. The reason for this has to do with\nthe hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, the brain's and body's\nstress response system that governs our fight-or-flight response. How does it work? Well, imagine you're walking\nin the forest and you see a bear. Immediately, your hypothalamus\nsends a signal to your pituitary, which sends a signal \nto your adrenal gland that says, \"Release stress hormones!\nAdrenaline! Cortisol!\" And so your heart starts to pound, Your pupils dilate, your airways open up, and you are ready to either\nfight that bear or run from the bear. And that is wonderful if you're in a forest\nand there's a bear. (Laughter) But the problem is what happens\nwhen the bear comes home every night, and this system is activated\nover and over and over again, and it goes from being\nadaptive, or life-saving, to maladaptive, or health-damaging. Children are especially sensitive\nto this repeated stress activation, because their brains and bodies\nare just developing. High doses of adversity not only affect\nbrain structure and function, they affect the developing immune system, developing hormonal systems, and even the way our DNA\nis read and transcribed. So for me, this information\nthrew my old training out the window, because when we understand\nthe mechanism of a disease, when we know not only\nwhich pathways are disrupted, but how, then as doctors, it is our job\nto use this science for prevention and treatment. That's what we do. So in San Francisco, we created\nthe Center for Youth Wellness to prevent, screen and heal the impacts\nof ACEs and toxic stress. We started simply with routine screening\nof every one of our kids at their regular physical, because I know that if my patient \nhas an ACE score of 4, she's two and a half times as likely\nto develop hepatitis or COPD, she's four and half times as likely\nto become depressed, and she's 12 times as likely\nto attempt to take her own life as my patient with zero ACEs. I know that when she's in my exam room. For our patients who do screen positive, we have a multidisciplinary treatment team\nthat works to reduce the dose of adversity and treat symptoms using best practices,\nincluding home visits, care coordination, mental health care, nutrition, holistic interventions, and yes,\nmedication when necessary. But we also educate parents\nabout the impacts of ACEs and toxic stress the same way you would for covering\nelectrical outlets, or lead poisoning, and we tailor the care\nof our asthmatics and our diabetics in a way that recognizes that they may\nneed more aggressive treatment, given the changes to their hormonal\nand immune systems. So the other thing that happens\nwhen you understand this science is that you want to shout it\nfrom the rooftops, because this isn't just an issue\nfor kids in Bayview. I figured the minute\nthat everybody else heard about this, it would be routine screening,\nmulti-disciplinary treatment teams, and it would be a race to the most\neffective clinical treatment protocols. Yeah. That did not happen. And that was a huge learning for me. What I had thought of as simply\nbest clinical practice I now understand to be a movement. In the words of Dr. Robert Block, the former President\nof the American Academy of Pediatrics, \"Adverse childhood experiences are the single greatest\nunaddressed public health threat facing our nation today.\" And for a lot of people,\nthat's a terrifying prospect. The scope and scale of the problem\nseems so large that it feels overwhelming to think about how we might approach it. But for me, that's actually\nwhere the hopes lies, because when we have the right framework, when we recognize this to be\na public health crisis, then we can begin to use the right \ntool kit to come up with solutions. From tobacco to lead poisoning \nto HIV/AIDS, the United States actually has\nquite a strong track record with addressing public health problems, but replicating those successes\nwith ACEs and toxic stress is going to take determination\nand commitment, and when I look at what\nour nation's response has been so far, I wonder, why haven't we taken this more seriously? You know, at first I thought\nthat we marginalized the issue because it doesn't apply to us. That's an issue for those kids\nin those neighborhoods. Which is weird, because the data\ndoesn't bear that out. The original ACEs study\nwas done in a population that was 70 percent Caucasian, 70 percent college-educated. But then, the more I talked to folks, I'm beginning to think that maybe\nI had it completely backwards. If I were to ask\nhow many people in this room grew up with a family member\nwho suffered from mental illness, I bet a few hands would go up. And then if I were to ask how many folks\nhad a parent who maybe drank too much, or who really believed that\nif you spare the rod, you spoil the child, I bet a few more hands would go up. Even in this room, this is an issue\nthat touches many of us, and I am beginning to believe\nthat we marginalize the issue because it does apply to us. Maybe it's easier to see\nin other zip codes because we don't want to look at it. We'd rather be sick. Fortunately, scientific advances\nand, frankly, economic realities make that option less viable every day. The science is clear: Early adversity dramatically affects\nhealth across a lifetime. Today, we are beginning to understand\nhow to interrupt the progression from early adversity\nto disease and early death, and 30 years from now, the child who has a high ACE score and whose behavioral symptoms\ngo unrecognized, whose asthma management\nis not connected, and who goes on to develop\nhigh blood pressure and early heart disease or cancer will be just as anomalous\nas a six-month mortality from HIV/AIDS. People will look at that situation\nand say, \"What the heck happened there?\" This is treatable. This is beatable. The single most important thing\nthat we need today is the courage to look\nthis problem in the face and say, this is real\nand this is all of us. I believe that we are the movement. Thank you.

Vemma’s offer was open to everybody, regardless of prior experience \nor education. There were only two steps to start \nget started earning: purchase a $500-600 kit \nof their liquid nutrition products, and recruit two more members \nto do the same. Vemma Nutrition Company grew quickly, becoming a global operation that brought in 30,000 new members \nper month at its peak. There was just one problem— while the company generated $200 million\nof annual revenue by 2013, the vast majority of participants \nearned less than they paid in. Vemma was eventually charged with \noperating a pyramid scheme: a common type of fraud where members make money by recruiting more people to buy in. Typically, the founder solicits an initial\ngroup of people to buy in and promote the scheme. They are then encouraged to recruit others and promised part of the money \nthose people invest, while the founder also takes a share. The pattern repeats for each group \nof new participants, with money from recent arrivals funneled \nto those who recruited them. This differs from a Ponzi scheme, where the founders recruit new members and secretly use their fees to \npay existing members, who think the payments come \nfrom a legitimate investment. As a pyramid scheme grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for new \nrecruits to make money. That’s because the number of participants\nexpands exponentially. Take a structure where each person has \nto recruit six more to earn a profit. The founder recruits six people to start, and each of them recruits six more. There are 36 people in that second\nround of recruits, who then each recruit 6 people— a total of 216 new recruits. By the twelfth round of recruiting, the 2.1 billion newest members \nwould have to recruit over 13 billion more people total \nto make money– more than the entire world population. In this scenario, the most recent recruits, over 80% of the scheme’s participants, lose all the money they paid in. And in real life, many earlier joiners lose out too. Pyramid schemes are illegal \nin most countries, but they can be difficult to detect. They are presented as many \ndifferent things, including gifting groups, investment clubs, and multi-level \nmarketing businesses. The distinction between pyramid schemes \nand legitimate multi-level marketing can be particularly hazy. In theory, the difference is that the members of the multi-level \nmarketing companies primarily earn compensation from selling\na particular product or a service to retail customers, while pyramid schemes primarily compensate\nmembers for recruitment of new sellers. In practice, though, many multi-level marketing companies make \nit all but impossible for members to profit purely \nthrough sales. And many pyramid schemes, \nlike Vemma Nutrition, disguise themselves as legal multi-level\nmarketing businesses, using a product or service to hide the\npay-and-recruit structure. Many pyramid schemes also capitalize \non already existing trust within churches, immigrant communities, \nor other tightly knit groups. The first few members are encouraged \nto report a good experience before they actually start \nmaking a profit. Others in their network follow \ntheir example, and the schemes balloon in size before it comes clear that most members\naren’t actually profiting. Often, the victims are \nembarrassed into silence. Pyramid schemes entice people with the\npromise of opportunity and empowerment. So when members don’t end up making money, they can blame themselves \nrather than the scheme, thinking they weren’t tenacious enough \nto earn the returns promised. Some victims keep trying, investing in multiple schemes, and losing money each time. In spite of all these factors, there are ways to spot a pyramid scheme. Time pressure is one red flag— be wary of directives to “act now or \nmiss a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.” Promises of large, life-altering\namounts of income are also suspect. And finally, a legitimate multi-level \nmarketing business shouldn’t require members to pay for the\nopportunity to sell a product or service. Pyramid schemes can be incredibly \ndestructive to individuals, communities, and even entire countries.

It's about time, too. Right? [laughter] Any of you know how to throw a space party?\nI guess you just planet! [laughter] Celebrity gossip! Oxygen and magnesium are\ndating. O-Mg! [laughter] On the surface, laughter appears to be an\nunconscious, instantaneous reaction to something that pleases us rather than displeases us,\nbut laughter is actually much more complicated than that, and it has surprisingly little\nto do with the human sense of humor. Now, I promise for the rest of this video, I'm\nonly going to make science puns… periodically. [MUSIC] Laughter is one of those rare and beautiful\nthings shared by people all over Earth, a human experience that transcends borders of\nlanguage, geography, and lifestyle. No one has to teach us to laugh, and people\neverywhere do it pretty much the same way. But it’s also really, really strange.\n[laughing] Squishing up your face and gnashing your teeth\nat other people while uncontrollably grunting and hyperventilating, that’s a very weird\nthing to do. You’re weird. We’re all weird. Laughing isn’t that different from breathing.\nWe have incredibly fine muscle control over how we let out breath, it’s what lets us\nmake the intricate and detailed vocal noises that we call speech. But while we write out laughter with ha ha\nha, it’s not really something we speak. If I actually laughed like “HA HA HA”\nthen laughter would be even weirder than it already is, and like I said, plenty weird. Laughing is this sort of “heh heh heh”\npercussive air squeezing, maybe the simplest vocal noise we can make. If we think of talking\nlike playing human bagpipes, constant pressure and intricate control, then laughing like\none of those silly little horns. Think humans are the only animals that laugh?\nNot by a long shot. Primates do it, dogs do a form of laughter, even rats do it. Yes,\neven rats. The folks from Radiolab got it on tape. [sound of rat \"laughing\"] In animals, sometimes it’s associated with\ntickling, sometimes with play, but laughing is almost always social. Same goes for us. Humans laugh for a number\nof reasons, but most of the time it has nothing to with funny business. Researchers like Robert\nProvine have found, after listening to hundreds of people laugh in social situations, less\nthan 1 in 5 chuckles are in response to humor, and when a joke is involved, the person telling\nit is far more likely to be the one laughing. We’re also 30 times more likely to laugh\nwith other people around than if we’re are alone. If laughter is a form of communication, then\nwhat are we trying to say? We do it to communicate understanding, to\nshow we like and accept others, to diffuse awkward situations, and yes, sometimes even\nto be mean. On January 30, 1962, at a boarding school\nin Tanzania, three young girls started giggling. This laughter spread throughout the school,\nuncontrollably, and ultimately 95 students experienced laughing fits- one even laughed\nfor 16 days straight. As a result of this “omuneepo” the school\nwas temporarily closed, but the laughing spread to the girls home villages, eventually this\nside-splitting mystery infected hundreds of people before dying out as suddenly as it\nbegan. Like yawning, laughter is surprisingly contagious,\nkind of like a behavioral germ. We’re much more likely to catch laughter from people\nwe know, which just goes to show how much more it is about bonding than humor. In close relationships, couples who use laughter\nto cope with stressful situations tend to stay together longer and report higher satisfaction.\nLaughing apparently helps us love. \"Laughing exercise for the heart and mind.\nWhat you can do? Just laugh. Very easy. Don't feel shy!\" [laughter] Laughter is amazingly hard to fake, and our\nbrains are really good at telling the difference. Listen to these clips and see if you can tell\nwhich one is real and which one is fake. [laughter] Younger people are less able to tell real\nlaughter from fake laughter, but they are more susceptible to contagious laughter, which\nis maybe why it’s easy to make a baby do this. [laughter] But if we are so good at telling real from\nfake laughter, and laughter is ultimately a form of communication, then why do we laugh\nat movies? [laughter] In the higher-order parts of our brain, we’re consciously aware that the\nactors we are watching are not present with us, and that they are pretending. Maybe the fact that we can laugh at what we\nknow to be fake is the ultimate case of suspending our disbelief, when we watch something on\na screen, we really do believe the people are right there with us, and that we know\nthem, at least in some way. Maybe we should all try and laugh more, and\nwith each other. It’s not only a way to feel better, but feel better together. Stay curious."}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 20, "lesson": 21, "title": "4 reasons to learn a new language - John McWhorter", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/i9eDOogu", "transcript": {"en": "The language I'm speaking right now is on its way to becoming\nthe world's universal language, for better or for worse. Let's face it, it's the language of the internet, it's the language of finance, it's the language of air traffic control, of popular music, diplomacy -- English is everywhere. Now, Mandarin Chinese\nis spoken by more people, but more Chinese people\nare learning English than English speakers\nare learning Chinese. Last I heard, there are two dozen universities\nin China right now teaching all in English. English is taking over. And in addition to that, it's been predicted\nthat at the end of the century almost all of the languages\nthat exist now -- there are about 6,000 -- will no longer be spoken. There will only be some hundreds left. And on top of that, it's at the point where\ninstant translation of live speech is not only possible,\nbut it gets better every year. The reason I'm reciting\nthose things to you is because I can tell\nthat we're getting to the point where a question\nis going to start being asked, which is: Why should we\nlearn foreign languages -- other than if English\nhappens to be foreign to one? Why bother to learn another one\nwhen it's getting to the point where almost everybody in the world\nwill be able to communicate in one? I think there are a lot of reasons, but I first want to address the one that you're probably\nmost likely to have heard of, because actually it's more\ndangerous than you might think. And that is the idea that a language channels your thoughts, that the vocabulary\nand the grammar of different languages gives everybody\na different kind of acid trip, so to speak. That is a marvelously enticing idea, but it's kind of fraught. So it's not that it's untrue completely. So for example, in French and Spanish the word for table is,\nfor some reason, marked as feminine. So, \"la table,\" \"la mesa,\"\nyou just have to deal with it. It has been shown that if you are a speaker\nof one of those languages and you happen to be asked how you would imagine a table talking, then much more often\nthan could possibly be an accident, a French or a Spanish speaker says that the table would talk\nwith a high and feminine voice. So if you're French or Spanish,\nto you, a table is kind of a girl, as opposed to if you\nare an English speaker. It's hard not to love data like that, and many people\nwill tell you that that means that there's a worldview that you have\nif you speak one of those languages. But you have to watch out, because imagine if somebody\nput us under the microscope, the us being those of us\nwho speak English natively. What is the worldview from English? So for example,\nlet's take an English speaker. Up on the screen, that is Bono. He speaks English. I presume he has a worldview. Now, that is Donald Trump. In his way, he speaks English as well. (Laughter) And here is Ms. Kardashian, and she is an English speaker, too. So here are three speakers\nof the English language. What worldview do those\nthree people have in common? What worldview is shaped through\nthe English language that unites them? It's a highly fraught concept. And so gradual consensus is becoming\nthat language can shape thought, but it tends to be in rather darling,\nobscure psychological flutters. It's not a matter of giving you\na different pair of glasses on the world. Now, if that's the case, then why learn languages? If it isn't going to change\nthe way you think, what would the other reasons be? There are some. One of them is that if you\nwant to imbibe a culture, if you want to drink it in,\nif you want to become part of it, then whether or not\nthe language channels the culture -- and that seems doubtful -- if you want to imbibe the culture, you have to control to some degree the language that the culture\nhappens to be conducted in. There's no other way. There's an interesting\nillustration of this. I have to go slightly obscure,\nbut really you should seek it out. There's a movie by the Canadian\nfilm director Denys Arcand -- read out in English on the page,\n\"Dennis Ar-cand,\" if you want to look him up. He did a film called \"Jesus of Montreal.\" And many of the characters are vibrant, funny, passionate,\ninteresting French-Canadian, French-speaking women. There's one scene closest to the end, where they have to take a friend\nto an Anglophone hospital. In the hospital,\nthey have to speak English. Now, they speak English\nbut it's not their native language, they'd rather not speak English. And they speak it more slowly, they have accents, they're not idiomatic. Suddenly these characters\nthat you've fallen in love with become husks of themselves,\nthey're shadows of themselves. To go into a culture and to only ever process people\nthrough that kind of skrim curtain is to never truly get the culture. And so to the extent that hundreds\nof languages will be left, one reason to learn them is because they are tickets\nto being able to participate in the culture of the people\nwho speak them, just by virtue of the fact\nthat it is their code. So that's one reason. Second reason: it's been shown that if you speak two languages,\ndementia is less likely to set in, and that you are probably\na better multitasker. And these are factors that set in early, and so that ought to give you some sense of when to give junior or juniorette\nlessons in another language. Bilingualism is healthy. And then, third -- languages are just an awful lot of fun. Much more fun than we're often told. So for example,\nArabic: \"kataba,\" he wrote, \"yaktubu,\" he writes, she writes. \"Uktub,\" write, in the imperative. What do those things have in common? All those things have in common the consonants sitting\nin the middle like pillars. They stay still, and the vowels\ndance around the consonants. Who wouldn't want to roll\nthat around in their mouths? You can get that from Hebrew, you can get that from Ethiopia's\nmain language, Amharic. That's fun. Or languages have different word orders. Learning how to speak\nwith different word order is like driving on the different side\nof a street if you go to certain country, or the feeling that you get when you\nput Witch Hazel around your eyes and you feel the tingle. A language can do that to you. So for example, \"The Cat in the Hat Comes Back,\" a book that I'm sure\nwe all often return to, like \"Moby Dick.\" One phrase in it is,\n\"Do you know where I found him? Do you know where he was?\nHe was eating cake in the tub, Yes he was!\" Fine. Now, if you learn that\nin Mandarin Chinese, then you have to master, \"You can know, I did where him find? He was tub inside gorging cake, No mistake gorging chewing!\" That just feels good. Imagine being able to do that\nfor years and years at a time. Or, have you ever learned any Cambodian? Me either, but if I did, I would get to roll around in my mouth\nnot some baker's dozen of vowels like English has, but a good 30 different vowels scooching and oozing around\nin the Cambodian mouth like bees in a hive. That is what a language can get you. And more to the point, we live in an era when it's never been\neasier to teach yourself another language. It used to be that you had\nto go to a classroom, and there would be\nsome diligent teacher -- some genius teacher in there -- but that person was only\nin there at certain times and you had to go then, and then was not most times. You had to go to class. If you didn't have that,\nyou had something called a record. I cut my teeth on those. There was only so much data on a record, or a cassette, or even that antique object known as a CD. Other than that you had books\nthat didn't work, that's just the way it was. Today you can lay down -- lie on your living room floor, sipping bourbon, and teach yourself\nany language that you want to with wonderful sets\nsuch as Rosetta Stone. I highly recommend\nthe lesser known Glossika as well. You can do it any time, therefore you can do it more and better. You can give yourself your morning\npleasures in various languages. I take some \"Dilbert\" in various\nlanguages every single morning; it can increase your skills. Couldn't have done it 20 years ago when the idea of having\nany language you wanted in your pocket, coming from your phone, would have sounded like science fiction\nto very sophisticated people. So I highly recommend that you teach yourself languages\nother than the one that I'm speaking, because there's never been\na better time to do it. It's an awful lot of fun. It won't change your mind, but it will most certainly blow your mind. Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

But they didn’t do it alone. Whatever corner of the globe you find \nhomo sapiens in today, you’re likely to find another \nspecies nearby: Canis lupus familiaris. Whether they’re herding, hunting, \nsledding, or slouching the sheer variety of domestic \ndogs is staggering. But what makes the story of man’s \nbest friend so surprising is that they all evolved from a creature often seen as one of our oldest rivals: Canis lupus, or the gray wolf. When our Paleolithic ancestors first \nsettled Eurasia roughly 100,000 years ago, wolves were one of their main rivals \nat the top of the food chain. Able to exert over 300 lbs. of pressure \nin one bone-crushing bite and sniff out prey more than a mile away, these formidable predators didn’t have \nmuch competition. Much like human hunter-gatherers, they lived and hunted \nin complex social groups consisting of a few nuclear families, and used their social skills to \ncooperatively take down larger creatures. Using these group tactics, they operated as effective \npersistence hunters, relying not on outrunning their prey, but pursuing it to the point \nof exhaustion. But when pitted against the similar\nstrengths of their invasive new neighbors, wolves found themselves at a crossroads. For most packs, these bourgeoning bipeds represented \na serious threat to their territory. But for some wolves, especially those without a pack, human camps offered new opportunities. Wolves that showed less aggression\ntowards humans could come closer to their encampments, feeding on leftovers. And as these more docile scavengers \noutlasted their aggressive brethren, their genetic traits were passed on, gradually breeding tamer wolves\nin areas near human populations. Over time humans found a multitude of uses\nfor these docile wolves. They helped to track and hunt prey, and might have served as sentinels\nto guard camps and warn of approaching enemies. Their similar social structure made\nit easy to integrate with human families and learn to understand their commands. Eventually they moved from the fringes \nof our communities into our homes, becoming humanity’s \nfirst domesticated animal. The earliest of these Proto-Dogs\nor Wolf-Dogs, seem to have appeared around \n33,000 years ago, and would not have looked all that \ndifferent from their wild cousins. They were primarily distinguished \nby their smaller size and a shorter snout full of \ncomparatively smaller teeth. But as human cultures and occupations \nbecame more diverse and specialized, so did our friends. Short stocky dogs to herd livestock \nby nipping their heels; elongated dogs to flush badgers \nand foxes out of burrows; thin and sleek dogs for racing; and large, muscular dogs for guard duty. With the emergence of kennel clubs and \ndog shows during England’s Victorian era, these dog types were standardized \ninto breeds, with many new ones bred \npurely for appearance. Sadly, while all dog breeds are the \nproduct of artificial selection, some are healthier than others. Many of these aesthetic characteristics \ncome with congenital health problems, such as difficulty breathing \nor being prone to spinal injuries. Humanity’s longest experiment \nin controlled evolution has had other side effects as well. Generations of selection for tameness have favored more juvenile \nand submissive traits that were pleasing to humans. This phenomenon of selecting traits \nassociated with youth is known as neoteny, and can be seen in many domestic animals. Thousands of years of co-evolution \nmay even have bonded us chemically. Not only can canines understand \nour emotions and body language, but when dogs and humans interact, both our bodies release oxytocin; a hormone commonly associated with \nfeelings of love and protectiveness. It might be difficult to fathom how every\nPomeranian, Chihuahua, and Poodle are descended from fierce wolves. But the diversity of breeds today \nis the result of a relationship that precedes cities, agriculture, and even the disappearance \nof our Neanderthal cousins. And it’s heartening to know that given enough time, even our most dangerous rivals \ncan become our fiercest friends."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What canid species did modern domestic dogs descend from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Canis latrans"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Canis lupus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Canis dirus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Canis aureus"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What species are modern domestic dogs currently classified as?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Canis familiaris"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Canis lupus dingo"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vulpes Vulpes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Canis lupus familiaris"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What contributing factor led wolves and humans to easily cohabitate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Similar social structure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Similar diets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Similar habitat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of these factors"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "About how many years before the present do archaeologists start seeing dogs appear in the record?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "33,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "200,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "10,000"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What historical era did most modern dog breeds start appearing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Renaissance Era"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Classical Era"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Jeffersonian Era"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Victorian Era"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

So familiar, in fact, that for centuries we’ve had a single word to describe \nsuch characters: Machiavellian. But is it possible that we’ve been using \nthat word wrong this whole time? The early 16th century statesman Niccoló \nMachiavelli wrote many works of history, philosophy, \nand drama. But his lasting notoriety comes from a \nbrief political essay known as The Prince, framed as advice to current \nand future monarchs. Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this– in fact there was an entire tradition of \nworks known as “mirrors for princes” going back to antiquity. But unlike his predecessors, Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an \nideal government or exhort his audience to rule \njustly and virtuously. Instead, he focused on the \nquestion of power– how to acquire it, and how to keep it. And in the decades after it was published, The Prince gained a diabolical reputation. During the European Wars of Religion, both Catholics and Protestants \nblamed Machiavelli for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny\ncommitted by their opponents. By the end of the century, Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to \ndenote an amoral opportunist, leading directly to our popular use of \n“Machiavellian” as a synonym for manipulative villainy. At first glance, The Prince’s reputation as a manual for \ntyranny seems well-deserved. Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely \nunconcerned with morality, except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful \nto maintaining power. For instance, princes are told to \nconsider all the atrocities necessary to seize power, and to commit them in a single stroke to ensure future stability. Attacking neighboring territories and \noppressing religious minorities are mentioned as effective ways of \noccupying the public. Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the \nappearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon \nas one’s interests are threatened. Most famously, he notes that for a ruler, “it is much safer to be feared \nthan loved.” The tract even ends with an appeal to \nLorenzo de’ Medici, the recently installed ruler of Florence, urging him to unite the fragmented \ncity-states of Italy under his rule. Many have justified Machiavelli as \nmotivated by unsentimental realism and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by\ninternal and external conflict. According to this view, Machiavelli was the first to understand \na difficult truth: the greater good of political stability is worth whatever unsavory tactics \nare needed to attain it. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested \nthat rather than being amoral, The Prince hearkens back to \nancient Greek morality, placing the glory of the state above the \nChristian ideal of individual salvation. But what we know about Machiavelli might\nnot fit this picture. The author had served in his native \nFlorence for 14 years as a diplomat, staunchly defending its elected \nrepublican government against would-be monarchs. When the Medici family seized power, he not only lost his position, but was even tortured and banished. With this in mind, it’s possible to read the pamphlet \nhe wrote from exile not as a defense of princely rule, but a scathing description \nof how it operates. Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza saw it as warning free citizens of the various ways in which they can be\nsubjugated by aspiring rulers. In fact, both readings might be true. Machiavelli may have written a manual for \ntyrannical rulers, but by sharing it, he also revealed \nthe cards to those who would be ruled. In doing so, he revolutionized political philosophy, laying the foundations for Hobbes and \nfuture thinkers to study human affairs based on their \nconcrete realities rather than preconceived ideals. Through his brutal and shocking honesty, Machiavelli sought to shatter popular \ndelusions about what power really entails. And as he wrote to a friend \nshortly before his death, he hoped that people would “learn the way \nto Hell in order to flee from it.\""}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What does the word “Machiavellian” usually denote?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A person who uses underhanded scheming to achieve goals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A person who has excellent communication skills"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A person who overly complicates matters"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A person who wields a lot of power"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In which historical period did Machiavelli live?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Classical Antiquity"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elizabethan Era"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Napoleonic Era"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The Renaissance"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Machiavelli served in Florence as:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A general"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A priest"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A diplomat"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A baker"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is Machiavelli’s most famous written work?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The Book of the Courtier"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The Prince"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Leviathan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Richard the Third"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The Prince is part of what kind of tradition of works?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Games for Kings"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Riddles for Queens"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Memoirs for Magistrates"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mirrors for Princes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The Prince is most concerned with:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How to gain power and how to keep it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "How to gain land and use resources"}, {"label": "C", "text": "How to choose political advisors"}, {"label": "D", "text": "How to win friends and influence people"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
