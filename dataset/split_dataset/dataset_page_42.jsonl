Guerra", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-the-octopus-brain-is-so-extraordinary-claudio-l-guerra", "transcript": {"en": "What could octopuses possibly\nhave in common with us? After all, they don't have lungs, spines,\nor even a plural noun we can all agree on. But what they do have is the ability\nto solve puzzles, learn through observation, and even use tools, just like some other animals we know. And what makes octopus intelligence\nso amazing is that it comes \nfrom a biological structure completely different from ours. The 200 or so species of octopuses are mollusks \nbelonging to the order cephalopoda, Greek for head-feet. Those heads contain impressively\nlarge brains, with a brain to body ratio similar\nto that of other intelligent animals, and a complex nervous system with\nabout as many neurons as that of a dog. But instead of being \ncentralized in the brain, these 500 million neurons are spread out\nin a network of interconnected ganglia organized into three basic structures. The central brain only contains\nabout 10% of the neurons, while the two huge optic lobes\ncontain about 30%. The other 60% are in the tentacles, which for humans would be like\nour arms having minds of their own. This is where things \nget even more interesting. Vertebrates like us have a rigid skeleton\nto support our bodies, with joints that allow us to move. But not all types of movement are allowed. You can't bend your knee backwards, or bend your forearm in the middle,\nfor example. Cephalopods, on the other hand,\nhave no bones at all, allowing them to bend their limbs\nat any point and in any direction. So shaping their tentacles into any one of the virtually \nlimitless number of possible arrangements is unlike anything we are used to. Consider a simple task,\nlike grabbing and eating an apple. The human brain contains a neurological\nmap of our body. When you see the apple, your brain's motor center activates\nthe appropriate muscles, allowing you to reach out with your arm, grab it with your hand, bend your elbow joint, and bring it to your mouth. For an octopus, \nthe process is quite different. Rather than a body map, the cephalopod brain \nhas a behavior library. So when an octopus sees food, its brain doesn't activate \na specific body part, but rather a behavioral response to grab. As the signal travels through the network, the arm neurons pick up the message and jump into action \nto command the movement. As soon as the arm touches the food, a muscle activation wave travels\nall the way through the arm to its base, while the arm sends back another wave\nfrom the base to the tip. The signals meet halfway\nbetween the food and the base of the arm, letting it know to bend at that spot. What all this means is that each\nof an octopus's eight arms can essentially think for itself. This gives it amazing flexibility \nand creativity when facing a new situation or problem, whether its opening \na bottle to reach food, escaping through a maze, moving around in a new environment, changing the texture and the color\nof its skin to blend into the scenery, or even mimicking other creatures\nto scare away enemies. Cephalopods may have evolved \ncomplex brains long before our vertebrate relatives. And octopus intelligence isn't just useful\nfor octopuses. Their radically different nervous system\nand autonomously thinking appendages have inspired new research in developing flexible robots\nmade of soft materials. And studying how intelligence can arise\nalong such a divergent evolutionary path can help us understand more about\nintelligence and consciousness in general. Who knows what other forms \nof intelligent life are possible, or how they process the world around them."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following sentences is correct?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All mollusks have large brains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "There are other types of cephalopods besides octopus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cephalopods have large brains that contain most of their neurons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Octopuses have heads as large as a dog's"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "The majority of the octopod nervous system is composed of:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Brain, cerebellum and brainstem"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Central brain and arm brains"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ganglia spread throughout the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Ganglia organized in central brain, optic lobes and arms ganglia"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which of the following sentences is incorrect?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Octopuses are soft-bodied invertebrates"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cephalopod brains have a neurological map of the body"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Octopuses have a behavioral library in their brain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Motor commands are processed differently by humans and octopuses"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Octopuses are capable of incredible deeds.

Buying their goods, using their services, even wearing their names. Corporations and companies have become such a familiar part \nof the modern landscape that it's easy to forget they're \nartificial entities created to allow real people\nto do business. But there are some types of companies that aren't engaged \nin any business at all. Instead, these anonymous companies exist mainly to disguise \npeople doing things they'd rather not have \nthe public know about. And these people go to great lengths\nto hide any links between their names and the companies they own. The life of an anonymous company usually begins in what's known\nas a secrecy jurisdiction, a place whose laws allow \nnew companies to be registered with little disclosure about who owns\nor controls them. Some may simply not require\ncollecting that information. Others may collect it, but make it nearly inaccessible\nto anyone else. And the lack of incentive to verify\ncompanies' real owners makes it easy for people\nto cover their tracks. For example, someone may register\na company in the name of a relative, an associate, or even a nominee director who acts on instruction \nfrom the company's actual owner while keeping their name confidential. Once registered, a company can do many \nof the same things as a human being, like opening bank accounts, buying and owning assets, and transferring money. What's more, it can be listed as the owner\nof other companies, including ones opened in places\nwith stricter disclosure rules. This allows someone to create\na complex world-wide chain of ownership that can take years to unravel. A company based in the U.S. may be wholly owned by another one\nin Liechtenstein, which is owned in turn by one\nin the British Virgin Islands. And an anonymous company can be\ntransferred to a new owner at any time with no public record of the change. So why all the anonymity? Defenders of financial secrecy argue\nthat wealthy individuals need it to avoid intrusive media attention and threats to personal security. But while this may sometimes be justified, anonymous companies play a role\nin almost every type of economic crime, including many major corruption cases. They are used by corporations \nevading taxes, rogue governments skirting sanctions, terrorists buying arms, and dictators financing wars. Organized crime groups launder\ntheir profits through anonymous companies. Corrupt government officials award\nvaluable contracts to corporations they secretly own. International oligarchs with criminal\nconnections or questionable pasts have used anonymous companies\nto discretely buy luxury apartments in cities like London and New York City, keeping them as safe stores of wealth. And even when criminals are convicted, their anonymously held assets may be difficult for authorities \nto locate or seize, making it harder for victims \nto be compensated. Efforts are now underway to chip away \nat these crime-enabling mechanisms. International authorities and NGOs have called for requiring companies to\nstate who ultimately makes their decisions and benefits from their assets. But while progress is being made, international cooperation \nhas been difficult to achieve, as governments that profit from \nregistering anonymous companies are reluctant to lose business. And some of the most popular places\nfor this practice are located not on remote,\ntropical tax shelters, but within the same advanced nations\nwhich claim to be leading the fight for global financial transparency. But still, it's a fight worth fighting. Closing the legal loopholes that enable\nanonymous companies would help us cut down on corruption\nand illegal activity. It would also allow us, \nas the general public, to better understand the flow\nof enormous sums of money that impact politics, our daily lives,\nand the health of our world."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following things can a company NOT do?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Own other companies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Open bank accounts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Obtain a marriage license"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of the following things is NOT a common method for forming anonymous companies?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Registering it in a secrecy jurisdiction"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Registering it under a fake name"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Registering it under another anonymous company"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is an argument that people make in favor of anonymous companies?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They protect wealthy people's privacy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They enhance the brand image"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are more efficient than companies whose ownership is known"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Where do anonymous companies operate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "On remote tropical islands"}, {"label": "B", "text": "In rogue nations"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Globally"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the nominee director?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Someone nominated by the company's board of directors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Someone who nominates candidates to the board of directors"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Someone who registers the company in their name but is not the actual beneficiary"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Can you resist tackling a brain teaser written by one of the smartest \npeople in history? Let's give it a shot. The world's rarest fish has been\nstolen from the city aquarium. The police have followed the scent to a\nstreet with five identical looking houses. But they can't search \nall the houses at once, and if they pick the wrong one,\nthe thief will know they're on his trail. It's up to you, the city's best detective,\nto solve the case. When you arrive on the scene,\nthe police tell you what they know. One: each house's owner \nis of a different nationality, drinks a different beverage, and smokes a different type of cigar. Two: each house's interior walls\nare painted a different color. Three: each house contains a different animal,\none of which is the fish. After a few hours of expert sleuthing,\nyou gather some clues. It may look like a lot of information, but there's a clear logical path\nto the solution. Solving the puzzle will be\na lot like Sudoku, so you may find it helpful to organize\nyour information in a grid, like this. Pause the video on the following screen to\nexamine your clues and solve the riddle. Answer in: 3 2 1 To start, you fill in the information\nfrom clues eight and nine. Immediately, you also realize that since\nthe Norwegian is at the end of the street, there's only one house next to him, which must be the one with the blue walls\nin clue fourteen. Clue five says the green-walled\nhouse's owner drinks coffee. It can't be the center house since you\nalready know its owner drinks milk, but it also can't be the second house,\nwhich you know has blue walls. And since clue four says the green-walled house must be directly\nto the left of the white-walled one, it can't be the first \nor fifth house either. The only place left \nfor the green-walled house with the coffee drinker\nis the fourth spot, meaning the white-walled house\nis the fifth. Clue one gives you \na nationality and a color. Since the only column missing both\nthese values is the center one, this must be the Brit's red-walled home. Now that the only unassigned \nwall color is yellow, this must be applied to the first house, where clue seven says \nthe Dunhill smoker lives. And clue eleven tells you that\nthe owner of the horse is next door, which can only be the second house. The next step is to figure out what\nthe Norwegian in the first house drinks. It can't be tea, clue three tells you\nthat's the Dane. As per clue twelve, it can't be root beer\nsince that person smokes Bluemaster, and since you already \nassigned milk and coffee, it must be water. From clue fifteen, you know that the Norwegian's neighbor,\nwho can only be in the second house, smokes Blends. Now that the only spot in the grid\nwithout a cigar and a drink is in the fifth column, that must be the home of the person\nin clue twelve. And since this leaves only the second\nhouse without a drink, the tea-drinking Dane must live there. The fourth house is now the only one\nmissing a nationality and a cigar brand, so the Prince-smoking German\nfrom clue thirteen must live there. Through elimination, you can conclude\nthat the Brit smokes Pall Mall and the Swede lives in the fifth house, while clue six and clue two tell you that these two have a bird \nand a dog, respectively. Clue ten tells you that the cat owner\nlives next to the Blend-smoking Dane, putting him in the first house. Now with only one spot left on the grid, you know that the German in the \ngreen-walled house must be the culprit. You and the police burst into the house, catching the thief fish-handed. While that explanation \nwas straightforward, solving puzzles like this often\ninvolves false starts and dead ends. Part of the trick is to use \nthe process of elimination and lots of trial and error\nto hone in on the right pieces, and the more logic puzzles you solve, the better your intuition will be for when and where there's enough \ninformation to make your deductions. And did young Einstein \nreally write this puzzle? Probably not. There's no evidence he did, and some of the brands mentioned\nare too recent.

Luke Howard was a pharmacist\nby profession, but he was a meteorologist by inclination, having been obsessed by clouds\nand weather since childhood. As a school boy, he spent hours\nstaring out of the classroom window, gazing at the passing clouds. Like everyone else at the time,\nhe had no idea how clouds formed, or how they stayed aloft. But he enjoyed observing \ntheir endless transformations. By his own admission, Luke paid little\nattention to his lessons, but fortunately for the future\nof meteorology, he managed to pick up \na good knowledge of Latin. Compared to the other natural sciences, meteorology, the study of weather,\nwas a late developer, mainly because weather is elusive. You can't snap off a piece of rainbow or a section of cloud\nfor convenient study. You can, of course, collect rain water\nin calibrated containers, but all you really end up with\nare buckets of water. Understanding clouds required\na different approach, which is where Luke Howard's idea came in. His simple insight based \non years of observation was that clouds have \nmany individual shapes but they have few basic forms. In fact, all clouds belong \nto one of three principle types to which Howard gave the names: cirrus, Latin for tendril or hair, cumulus, heap or pile, and stratus, layer or sheet. But that wasn't the clever part. Clouds are constantly changing,\nmerging, rising, falling, and spreading throughout the atmosphere, rarely maintaining the same shapes\nfor more than a few minutes. Any successful naming system had to accommodate \nthis essential instability, as Howard realized. So, in addition to \nthe three main cloud types, he introduced a series of intermediate\nand compound types as a way of including the regular\ntransitions that occur among clouds. A high, whispy cirrus cloud\nthat descended and spread into a sheet was named cirrostratus, while groups of fluffy cumulus clouds\nthat joined up and spread were named stratocumulus. Howard identified seven cloud types, but these have since been expanded to ten, cloud nine being the towering \ncumulonimbus thunder cloud, which is probably why being on cloud nine\nmeans to be on top of the world. Howard's classification had an immediate\ninternational impact. The German poet and scientist\nJ.W. von Goethe wrote a series of poems \nin praise of Howard's clouds, which ended with the memorable lines, \"As clouds ascend, \nare folded, scatter, fall, Let the world think of thee \nwho taught it all,\" while Percy Shelley \nalso wrote a poem \"The Cloud,\" in which each of Howard's \nseven cloud types was characterized in turn. But perhaps the most impressive response\nto the naming of clouds was by the painter John Constable, who spent two summers on Hampstead Heath\npainting clouds in the open air. Once they had been named and classified, clouds became easier to understand as the visible signs of otherwise \ninvisible atmospheric processes. Clouds write a kind of journal on the sky that allows us to understand\nthe circulating patterns of weather and climate. Perhaps the most important breakthrough\nin understanding clouds was realizing that they are subject\nto the same physical laws as everything else on Earth. Clouds, for example, do not float, but fall slowly \nunder the influence of gravity. Some of them stay aloft due to upward convection\nfrom the sun-heated ground, but most are in a state of slow,\nballetic descent. \"Clouds are the patron goddesses\nof idle fellows,\" as the Greek dramatist Aristophanes\nwrote in 420 B.C. and nephology, the study of clouds,\nremains a daydreamer's science, aptly founded by a thoughtful young man whose favorite activity was staring\nout of the window at the sky."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The names of the clouds were derived from which language?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Latin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Greek"}, {"label": "C", "text": "French"}, {"label": "D", "text": "German"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Luke Howard's profession was:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Meteorologist"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Teacher"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Pharmacist"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Clergyman"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The name 'cirrus' means:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heap or pile"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Layer or sheet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Light or pale"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tendril or hair"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which famous poet wrote a poem called 'The Cloud':", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "William Wordsworth"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Lord Byron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Percy Shelley"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Henry W.

What is the difference \nbetween a theory and a law, and is one better? Scientific laws and theories\nhave different jobs to do. A scientific law predicts\nthe results of certain initial conditions. It might predict your unborn \nchild's possible hair colors, or how far a baseball travels\nwhen launched at a certain angle. In contrast, a theory tries to provide\nthe most logical explanation about why things happen as they do. A theory might invoke\ndominant and recessive genes to explain how brown-haired parents\nended up with a red-headed child, or use gravity to shed light \non the parabolic trajectory of a baseball. In simplest terms, a law predicts what happens\nwhile a theory proposes why. A theory will never grow up into a law, though the development of one\noften triggers progress on the other. In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler\ntheorized cosmic musical harmonies to explain the nature of planetary orbits. He developed three brilliant laws\nof planetary motion while he was studying decades \nof precise astronomical data in an effort to find support \nfor his theory. While his three laws \nare still in use today, gravity replaced his theory of harmonics\nto explain the planets' motions. How did Kepler get part of it wrong? Well, we weren't handed \na universal instruction manual. Instead, we continually propose,\nchallenge, revise, or even replace our scientific ideas \nas a work in progress. Laws usually resist change since they wouldn't have been adopted\nif they didn't fit the data, though we occasionally revise laws \nin the face of new unexpected information. A theory's acceptance, however,\nis often gladiatorial. Multiple theories may compete\nto supply the best explanation of a new scientific discovery. Upon further research, scientists tend to favor the theory \nthat can explain most of the data, though there may still \nbe gaps in our understanding. Scientists also like \nwhen a new theory successfully predicts previously unobserved phenomena, like when Dmitri Mendeleev's theory\nabout the periodic table predicted several undiscovered elements. The term scientific theory\ncovers a broad swath. Some theories are new ideas \nwith little experimental evidence that scientists eye with suspicion, or even ridicule. Other theories, like those involving the Big Bang, \nevolution, and climate change, have endured years \nof experimental confirmation before earning acceptance by the majority \nof the scientific community. You would need to learn more about\na specific explanation before you'd know how well \nscientists perceive it. The word theory\nalone doesn't tell you. In full disclosure, the scientific community has bet\non the wrong horse before: alchemy, the geocentric model, spontaneous generation, and the interstellar aether are just a few of many theories \ndiscarded in favor of better ones. But even incorrect theories \nhave their value. Discredited alchemy was the birthplace\nof modern chemistry, and medicine made great strides long before we understood the roles\nof bacteria and viruses. That said, better theories often lead\nto exciting new discoveries that were unimaginable \nunder the old way of thinking. Nor should we assume \nall of our current scientific theories will stand the test of time. A single unexpected result is enough\nto challenge the status quo. However, vulnerability to some potentially\nbetter explanation doesn't weaken \na current scientific theory. Instead, it shields science from becoming\nunchallenged dogma. A good scientific law \nis a finely-tuned machine, accomplishing its task brilliantly but ignorant of why it works\nas well as it does.

So earlier this morning, I was kayaking on\nthe White River. I came to an island that only exists when\nthe water is low, so I had to choose which stream to follow down. I thought as I always do in these situations\nof Robert Frost's poem, the Road Not Taken. You know, the one that ends in, \"two roads\ndiverged in a yellow wood, and I took the one less travelled by, and that has made all\nthe difference.\" So I followed the road that seemed the less\nobvious choice. It turns out that it was the less obvious\nfor a reason. So Hank, the road not taken is an interesting\npoem because 1. it's kind of responsible for the death of\nthe person it was written for and 2. what most people conclude from the poem is\nthe exact opposite of what Robert Frost intended to conclude. And also, 3. this dissonance points at something terrible\nabout poetry I think Hank. But let's start with 1 - that dead guy. So Robert Frost was inspired to write this\npoem by the many walks he took with his friend, the English poet, Edward Thomas. Thomas was very obsessive and indecisive person,\nand every time they'd come to a fork in the road, he wouldn't know which one to take. You know, like how if you're in the English\ncountryside and if you choose the wrong path, you might get eaten by a lion. But you can't know that until after you've\nmade the choice. I assume that there'd be lions in England,\nat least dandy lions. In Frost's mind, the poem was gently mocking\npeople who obsess over the importance of tiny, little decisions, right? But as often happens with people who are mocked\ntoo gently, Edward Thomas didn't get the joke and took the poem very, very seriously. And so even though Edward Thomas was too old\nto be expected to enlist, he went ahead and took the road less travelled, joining the\nBritish army to fight in WII, where upon he was promptly shot through the chest and killed. Since then Hank, pretty much everyone, including\nme, has adopted Edward Thomas' interpretation of the poem despite the fact that it, you\nknow, killed him. I think there's just something alluring about\nthe idea choosing the less travelled is always a good idea. It would be very helpful if there was some\noverarching guideline, like \"follow the path that others don't.\" Also, following the road less taken has the\nadded advantage of making everyone feel like a non-conformist, which is nice. But of course, there are a bunch of problems. For one thing, if everyone followed the road\nless travelled, it quickly becomes the road more travelled. Furthermore, there are many times when the\nroad more travelled is more travelled for a reason, because for instance, the road less\ntravelled leads to a kayak unfriendly marsh. Or because there's something kind of nice\nabout having a spouse and two kids and a mini-van. Anyways Hank, I've been thinking about this\na lot because over at our podcast, Dear Hank and John, we've been getting a lot of questions\nfrom listeners who are making huge life decisions, you know, should I go into the military? Which college should I attend? Should I attend college at all? As humans, we constantly have to make all\nthese big, big decisions, with very limited information. Like Hank, we are both incredibly blessed\nto have great marriages and great spouses, but I had no idea what I was agreeing to on\nmy wedding day. I thought I was saying, \"I want to be in a\nromantic relationship with you for the rest of my life.\" I did not realize that I was also saying,\n\"I want to be co-CEOs of a company that raises children and mows lawns and stuff.\" Anyways Hank, the other thing about Dear Hank\nand John is that I insist on beginning each episode with a short poem. And so in the last few weeks, we've had a\nbunch of discussions about poetry - whether poetry matters, what poetry does, etc. And I think we have the Road Not Taken as\none answer about what poetry can do. Because poetry is so often musical and rhythmic,\nit has a way of sticking in our heads, like I memorized it almost by accident. Frost thought that the poem was exploring\nhow people experience choice making rather than offering advice, but precisely because\nit sounds good Hank, it seems like good advice. And even though I know it isn't good advice,\nat least not consistently, I suspect that the next time I am facing a fork in the road\nor fork in the river, those iambic feet will wander back into my mind. And I will once again be biased, however minutely,\ntoward the road less travelled. I guess that's one example of how I think\npoetry can really matter in the real lives of real people, Hank, and why I think that\npoets and readers alike need to be very careful with language. After all Hank, we don't want to end up like\nEdward Thomas, but we also don't want to end up like the poet, who at least in a roundabout\nway, killed him. Hank, I'll see you on Friday."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What did the speaker (John Green) discover when he tool the road less traveled while in his kayak?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A beautiful stream"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An impassable marsh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He was lost"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What did Frost think the poem was exploring?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How people experience choice-making."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Offering advice on good choices."}, {"label": "C", "text": "How not to make a bad choice."}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What did the speaker (John Green) discover when he took the road less traveled while in his kayak?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A beautiful stream"}, {"label": "B", "text": "An impassable marsh"}, {"label": "C", "text": "He was lost"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What did Frost think the poem was exploring?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "How people experience choice-making."}, {"label": "B", "text": "Offering advice on good choices."}, {"label": "C", "text": "How not to make a bad choice."}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 42, "lesson": 13, "title": "The science behind the myth: Homer's \"Odyssey\" - Matt Kaplan", "category": "Social Studies", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-science-behind-the-myth-homer-s-odyssey-matt-kaplan", "transcript": {"en": "Homer's \"Odyssey\", one of the oldest works \nof Western literature, recounts the adventures \nof the Greek hero Odysseus during his ten-year journey home\nfrom the Trojan War. Though some parts \nmay be based on real events, the encounters with strange monsters,\nterrifying giants and powerful magicians are considered to be complete fiction. But might there be more to these myths\nthan meets the eye? Let's look at one famous episode \nfrom the poem. In the midst of their long voyage, Odysseus and his crew find themselves\non the mysterious island of Aeaea. Starving and exhausted, some of the men\nstumble upon a palatial home where a stunning woman welcomes them\ninside for a sumptuous feast. Of course, this all turns out to be \ntoo good to be true. The woman, in fact, \nis the nefarious sorceress Circe, and as soon as the soldiers\nhave eaten their fill at her table, she turns them all into animals\nwith a wave of her wand. Fortunately, one of the men escapes, finds Odysseus \nand tells him of the crew's plight. But as Odysseus rushes to save his men, he meets the messenger god, Hermes, who advises him to first consume\na magical herb. Odysseus follows this advice, and when he finally encounters Circe,\nher spells have no effect on him, allowing him to defeat her\nand rescue his crew. Naturally, this story of witchcraft\nand animal transformations was dismissed as nothing more \nthan imagination for centuries. But in recent years, the many mentions\nof herbs and drugs throughout the passage have piqued the interest of scientists, leading some to suggest the myths might have been \nfictional expressions of real experiences. The earliest versions of Homer's text say that Circe mixed baneful drugs\ninto the food such that the crew might utterly forget\ntheir native land. As it happens, one of the plants growing\nin the Mediterranean region is an innocent sounding herb\nknown as Jimson weed, whose effects include pronounced amnesia. The plant is also loaded with compounds\nthat disrupt the vital neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Such disruption can cause \nvivid hallucinations, bizarre behaviors, and general difficulty distinguishing\nfantasy from reality, just the sorts of things which might make people believe \nthey've been turned into animals, which also suggests that Circe\nwas no sorceress, but in fact a chemist who knew how\nto use local plants to great effect. But Jimson weed is only half the story. Unlike a lot of material in the Odyssey, the text about the herb that Hermes\ngives to Odysseus is unusually specific. Called moly by the gods, it's described as being found\nin a forest glen, black at the root \nand with a flower as white as milk. Like the rest of the Circe episode, moly was dismissed \nas fictional invention for centuries. But in 1951, Russian pharmacologist\nMikhail Mashkovsky discovered that villagers \nin the Ural Mountains used a plant with a milk-white flower\nand a black root to stave off paralysis \nin children suffering from polio. The plant, called snowdrop, turned out to contain a compound\ncalled galantamine that prevented the disruption\nof the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, making it effective in treating\nnot only polio but other disease, such as Alzheimer's. At the 12th World Congress of Neurology, Doctors Andreas Plaitakis \nand Roger Duvoisin first proposed that snowdrop was, in fact,\nthe plant Hermes gave to Odysseus. Although there is not much direct\nevidence that people in Homer's day would have known about \nits anti-hallucinatory effects, we do have a passage from 4th century\nGreek writer Theophrastus stating that moly \nis used as an antidote against poisons. So, does this all mean that Odysseus, Circe, and other characters\nin the Odyssey were real? Not necessarily. But it does suggest that ancient stories\nmay have more elements of truth to them than we previously thought. And as we learn more\nabout the world around us, we may uncover some of the same knowledge hidden within the myths \nand legends of ages passed."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why is Odysseus's crew so desperate to enter Circe's palatial home?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They are very cold"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are starving"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They are lonely"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They have not showered in weeks"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What do the earliest versions of the story say Circe did to the food she served?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "She scatters magical seeds into it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "She casts a spell on it with her wand"}, {"label": "C", "text": "She mixes in drugs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "She adds three drops of her own enchanted blood"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What happens when acetylcholine is disrupted?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "People fall asleep and have vivid dreams of becoming animals"}, {"label": "B", "text": "People suffer amnesia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "People experience panic attacks"}, {"label": "D", "text": "People begin to fight like animals"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Why would a flower that can help stave off polio and Alzheimer's disease be of any use against Jimson weed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Polio, Alzheimer's and Jimson weed all attack the same neurotransmitter and the flower protects it"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Polio, Alzheimer's and Jimson weed all interfere with galantamine circulation and the flower helps the body to produce more of this vital compound"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Polio, Alzheimer's and Jimson weed sabotage activity in the parietal lobe of the brain and the flower increases blood flow to this important area"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Polio, Alheimer's and Jimson weed sabotage activity in the parietal lobe of the brain and the flower increases blood flow to this important area"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How do the writings of the Greek scholar Theophrastus help us to make sense of the \"Odyssey\"?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They point out that Odysseus's home island of Ithaca is a real place"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They reveal that jimsonweed was often used to poison people long ago"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They present a catalogue of plants that would have been useful for causing amnesia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They describe the flower that Hermes gives Odysseus as valuable as an antitoxin"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

I was a kid my parents would tell me you can make a mess but you have to clean up after yourself so freedom came with responsibility but my imagination will take me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible so I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I should say because I wrote who lied to us to protect us from the ugly truth and growing up I found out that adults make a mess and they're not very good at cleaning up after themselves fast forward I'm an adult now and I teach citizen science and invention at the Hong Kong harbor school and it doesn't take too long before my students walk on a beach and stumble upon piles of trash so as good citizens we clean up the beaches and no he's not drinking alcohol and if he is I didn't give it to him and so it's sad to say but today more than 80% of the oceans have plastic in them it's a horrifying fact and for the past decades we've been taking those big ships out and those big nets and we collect those plastic bits that we look under a microscope and we sort them and then we put this data on to him up but that takes forever it's very expensive and so quite risky to take those big boats out so with my students aged 6 to 15 we've been dreaming of inventing a better way so we've transformed our tiny Hong Kong classroom into a workshop and so we started building this small workbench with different height so even really short kids can participate and let me tell you kids and power tools are awesome and safe not really but so back to plastic we collect this plastic and we grind it to the size we find it in the ocean which is very small because it breaks down and so this is how we work I let the imagination of my students run wild and my job is to try to collect the best of each kids idea and trying to combine it into something that hopefully would work and so we have agreed that instead of collecting plastic bits we are going to collect only the data so we're going to get an image of the plastic with a robot so robots kids very very excited and the next thing we do we do what we call rapid prototyping we are so rapid at prototyping that the lunch is still in the lunch box when we're hacking it and we hack table lamps and webcams into plumbing fixture and we assemble that into a floating robot that be slowly moving through water into the plastic that we have there and this is the image we get in the robot so we see the plastic pieces floating slowly through the sensor and the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of each particles and so we have a rough estimate of how much plastic there is in the water so we documented this invention step by step on a website for inventors call Instructables in the hope that somebody will make it even better what was really cool about this project is that the students saw a local problem and boom they are trying to immediately address it but math students in Hong Kong are Harper connected kids and they watch the news they watch the Internet and they came across this image this was a child probably under 10 cleaning up in OSP or barehanded in the Sunderbans which is the world largest mangrove forest in Bangladesh so they were very shocked but because this is the water they drink this was the water they bathe and this is the water the fish and this is their the place where they live and also you can see the water is brown mud is brown and oil is brown so one or everything is mixed up it's really hard to see what's in the water but there's a technology that's rather simple that's called spectrometry that allows you to see what's in the water so we build a rough prototype of a spiritual meter and you can shine light through different substances that produce different spectrums so that can help you identify what's in the water so we packed this prototype of a sensor and we shipped it to Bangladesh so what was cool about this project is that beyond you know addressing a local problem or looking a local problem my students use the empathy and the sense of being creative to help other kids so I was very compelled by doing the second experiment and I wanted to take it even further maybe addressing a even harder problem and that's also closer to my heart so I'm half Japanese and half French and maybe you remember in 2011 there was a massive earthquake in Japan it was so violent that it triggered several giant waves that they are called tsunami and those le'me destroyed many cities on the eastern coast of Japan more than 14,000 people died in an instant also it damaged the nuclear power plant of Fukushima binnacle power plant just by the water and today I read the reports and an average of 300 tons are leaking from the nuclear power plant into the Pacific Ocean and today the whole Pacific Ocean has traces of contamination of caesium-137 if you go outside on the west coast you can measure Kashima everywhere but if you look at the map it could look like most of the relativity has been washed away from the Japanese coast and most of it is now it looks like it's safe it's blue well reality is a bit more complicated than this so I've been going to Fukushima every year since the accident and I measure independently and with other scientists on land in the river and this time we wanted to take the kids so of course we didn't take the kids the parents would have that will happen but but every night we will report to Mission Control at different masks they're wearing it could look like they didn't take the work seriously but they really did because they're going to have to live with radioactivity there the whole life and so what we deal with them is that we're discussing the data I've collected that day and talk about where we should be going next strategy its inner area etc and to do this we build a very rough topographical map of the region around a nuclear power plant and so build the elevation map we sprinkled pigments to represent real-time data for radioactivity and we spread water to simulate the rainfall and like this we could see that the radioactive dust is washing from the top of the mountain into the river system and leaking into the ocean so it's a rough rough estimate but with this in mind we've organized this expedition which was the closest to civilian have been to the nuclear power plant we are sailing 1.5 kilometers away from the nuclear power plant and with the help of the local fishermen we are collecting sediment from the seabed with a custom sediment sampler we've invented and built we packed the sediment into small bags we then dispatched them into hundreds of small bags that we sent to different universities and we produced a map of the seabed where the activity especially in estuaries where the fish will reproduce and I will hope that you will help improve the safety of the local fishermen and of your favorite sushi you can see a progression here we've gone from a local problem to remote problem to a global problem and it's being super exciting to work at this different scale with also very simple open source and technologies but the same time it's been increasingly frustrating because we have only starting to measure the damage that we have done we haven't even started to try to solve the problems and so even wonder if we should just take a leap and trying to invent better ways to do all these things and so the classroom starts to feel a little bit small so we found an industrial site in Hong Kong and we turned into the largest makerspace focused on social and environmental impact it's in Central Hong Kong and it's a place we can work with wood metal chemistry a bit of biology a bit about takes basically to deal pretty much everything there and it's a place where adults and kids can play together it's a place where kids dreams can come true with the help of adults and where adults can be kids again we're asking questions such as can we invent the future of mobility with renewable energies for example or can we help the mobility of the aging population by transforming very standard wheelchair into cool electric vehicles so plastic oil and reactivity are horrible horrible legacies but the very worst legacy that we can leave our children are our lives we can no longer afford to shield the kids from the ugly truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions so citizen scientists makers dreamers we must prepare the next generation that care about the environment and people and that can actually do something about it thank you"},

{"page": 42, "lesson": 15, "title": "Why can’t some people stop fidgeting?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/s6ZFgX5B", "transcript": {"en": "Many of my friends, teachers, romantic partners\nand even my parents have all told me to stop fidgeting, \"TRACE STOP SHAKING YOUR LEG.\" But I didn't even know I was doing it MOM,\ngeez! fidgeting friends\nOnce upon a time, Psychologist Sir Francis Galton was sitting in a lecture, got bored\nand decided to watch the audience instead of listen to the speaker. (been there!) According to him, these elderly Victorian\nlecture-goers were, \"swaying from side-to-side\" at about \"1 fidget a minute.\" When the audience's attention was aroused,\nhe noticed their fidgeting would lessen. In his paper, published in Nature, titled\n\"The Measure of Fidget\" Galton determined people must fidget out of boredom! This was before discussions about hyperactivity\nor sugar, or before the television RUINED our attention span. This was 1885! 130 years ago, people fidgeted. It's definitely not caused by over-caffeinated,\nADHD-prone, coddled millennials. Instead, fidgeting seems to be part of human\nnature. The dictionary defines fidgeting as \"small\nmovements, especially of the hands and feet, caused by nervousness or impatience,\" but\nscience has another explanation; it's a way to keep my brain active and focused. Yep, you heard me, fidgeting may equal focus. HASHTAG SCIENCE, YO. When brains are stressed we don't pay as close\nattention, and we don't learn as much! Cognitive Load Theory says to think of the\nbrain like a CPU; when too much is going on the brain can't focus. So, to offload some of that stress, the brain\nmight trigger our fidgeting! Lower stress is highly associated with better\nlearning and memory performance, so fidgeting can help us learn! Though science isn't sure… because maybe\nit's just men… For some reason men fidget twice as often\nas women, and a 2005 study from the University of Hertfordshire found fidgeting can reduce\nlevels of the stress hormone cortisol, which should lower stress. A study in PLoS ONE, however, that benefit\nseems to fall on men who fidgeted. The fidgeting men they tested performed better\non cognitive tests and had lower stress, but fidgeting women did neither. Another study with ADHD kids further muddies\nthe fidgeting waters, as fidgeting doesn't help everyone all the time. A study in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology\nassessed the working memory of young fidgeting boys. When ADHD kids were put in a swivel chair\nand allowed to spin, they performed better on memory tests. However, kids without ADHD performed worse\nwhen they were allowed to spin, and better when they stayed still. It would seem, though fidgeting may lower\nstress and help learning, there's a level where the benefits to our attention and learning\ndisappear. For example, drawing random doodles, kicking\nfeet, or shaking legs may be fine, but drawing specific pictures or walking around the room\nis too distracting and benefits are lost. So, perhaps boys with ADHD need to fidget? What about girls? Do they get ANY benefit? Well, a study from September 2015 in the American\nJournal of Preventive Medicine, looked at 13,000 UK women 12 years apart and found adults\nwho fidgeted, also burned calories! Their results found fidgeters had quote \"better\nhealth outcomes,\" than their still counterparts. And another study in Medicine & Science in\nSports & Exercise found fidgeting can burn up to 144 calories a day! That's more than a can of pop! Some researchers believe fidgeting seems to\nbe an adaptation to our more sedentary lifestyle. But a study in Frontiers in Psychology looking\nat memory retention of lectures, and fidgeting… found almost the same as Galton in 1885. If you track the number of fidgets per minute,\nit's a good indicator of audience boredom. Fidgeting seems to be a representation of\nour animal brains working hard to keep on task and learning. It can be irksome, but as long as it's not\ndistracting to others, it's not necessarily bad, and is (at least) burning some calories! Sometimes we're just… fidgety widgety. Do you fidget? How? Pen clicker? Leg shaker? Finger tapper? Nail biter? Whatchoo got? Tell us your fidgeting functions down below. Fidgeting might be annoying to some, but sitting\nis killing you. Yep. Your chair.

But what is it, and what does it do\nbesides making you miserable? Your body produces more than a liter\nof mucus every day, and all the wet surfaces of your body\nthat are not covered by skin, like your eyes, nose, mouth, lungs, and stomach get a liberal coating. That's why they're known \nas mucus membranes. Mucus plays lots of roles\nin your body. It keeps delicate tissues \nfrom drying out and cracking, which would expose them to infection. It lubricates your eyes so you can blink. It protects your stomach lining\nfrom acid. It neutralizes threats by removing\nor trapping substances that could make you sick. And finally, it houses and keeps your\nbody's trillions of bacterial inhabitants, your microbiota, under control. Mucus contains lots \nof different compounds, including proteins, fats, and salts. But a key component of mucus versatility\nis a set of proteins called mucins. Mucins are the primary \nlarge molecules in mucus and are essential \nfor giving mucus its slippery feel. They belong to a class of proteins\ncalled glycoproteins which are built out of both amino acids\nand sugars. In mucin, long chains of sugars\nare attached to specific amino acids in the protein backbone. The hydrophilic sugar chains help mucin\ndissolve in your body's watery fluids. Mucus, which is up to 90% water, stays hydrated thanks \nto these sugar chains. Some of these mucins can interact\nwith other mucin molecules to create a complex network\nthat establishes a barrier against pathogens and other invaders. That's why mucus is the body's first line\nof defense against foreign objects, like bacteria and dust. It's continuously produced to clear them\nfrom the respiratory tract, like a slimy conveyor belt. This keeps bacteria from getting\na solid purchase on delicate lung tissue, or making it to the blood stream,\nwhere they could cause a major infection. Many of those harmful bacteria\nalso cause diseases when they cluster into slimy growths\ncalled biofilms. But mucus contains mucins, antimicrobial peptides, antibodies, and even bacteria-hungry viruses\ncalled bacteriophages that all work together to prevent\nbiofilms from forming. If microbes do become harmful \nand you get sick, the body ramps up mucus production\nto try to quickly flush out the offenders, and the immune system floods your mucus\nwith extra white blood cells. In fact, the greenish mucus often\nassociated with infections gets its color from an enzyme\nproduced by those white blood cells. This multi-pronged approach \nto bacterial management is one of the main reasons \nwhy we're not sick all the time. Even though mucus protects against\nthe infectious bacteria, the vast majority of your body's bacterial\ntenants are not harmful, and many are actually beneficial. That's particularly true \nwhen they live in mucus, where they can perform \nimportant functions, like synthesizing vitamins, suppressing harmful inflammation, and controlling the growth \nof more harmful species. So even though you probably associate\nmucus with being ill, it's really helping you stay healthy. Sure, it might seem gross, but can you think of any other substance\nthat can lubricate, keep your body clean, fight infection, and domesticate a teeming \nbacterial population?

Not play with it, \nbut play it like a piano? That question doesn't \nmake a lot of sense at first, but an abstract mathematical field\ncalled group theory holds the answer, if you'll bear with me. In math, a group is a particular \ncollection of elements. That might be a set of integers, the face of a Rubik's Cube, or anything, so long as they follow \nfour specific rules, or axioms. Axiom one: all group operations must be closed\nor restricted to only group elements. So in our square, \nfor any operation you do, like turn it one way or the other, you'll still wind up with \nan element of the group. Axiom two: no matter where we put parentheses\nwhen we're doing a single group operation, we still get the same result. In other words, if we turn our square\nright two times, then right once, that's the same as once, then twice, or for numbers, one plus two \nis the same as two plus one. Axiom three: for every operation, there's an element\nof our group called the identity. When we apply it \nto any other element in our group, we still get that element. So for both turning the square\nand adding integers, our identity here is zero, not very exciting. Axiom four: every group element has an element \ncalled its inverse also in the group. When the two are brought together\nusing the group's addition operation, they result in the identity element, zero, so they can be thought of \nas cancelling each other out. So that's all well and good,\nbut what's the point of any of it? Well, when we get beyond \nthese basic rules, some interesting properties emerge. For example, let's expand our square\nback into a full-fledged Rubik's Cube. This is still a group \nthat satisfies all of our axioms, though now \nwith considerably more elements and more operations. We can turn each row \nand column of each face. Each position is called a permutation, and the more elements a group has,\nthe more possible permutations there are. A Rubik's Cube has more \nthan 43 quintillion permutations, so trying to solve it randomly \nisn't going to work so well. However, using group theory\nwe can analyze the cube and determine a sequence of permutations\nthat will result in a solution. And, in fact, that's exactly \nwhat most solvers do, even using a group theory notation\nindicating turns. And it's not just good for puzzle solving. Group theory is deeply embedded \nin music, as well. One way to visualize a chord\nis to write out all twelve musical notes and draw a square within them. We can start on any note,\nbut let's use C since it's at the top. The resulting chord is called\na diminished seventh chord. Now this chord is a group\nwhose elements are these four notes. The operation we can perform on it\nis to shift the bottom note to the top. In music that's called an inversion, and it's the equivalent \nof addition from earlier. Each inversion changes \nthe sound of the chord, but it never stops being\na C diminished seventh. In other words, it satisfies axiom one. Composers use inversions to manipulate\na sequence of chords and avoid a blocky, \nawkward sounding progression. On a musical staff, \nan inversion looks like this. But we can also overlay it onto our square\nand get this. So, if you were to cover your entire\nRubik's Cube with notes such that every face of the solved cube\nis a harmonious chord, you could express the solution\nas a chord progression that gradually moves \nfrom discordance to harmony and play the Rubik's Cube,\nif that's your thing."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The field of _____ theory is an abstract mathematical field which studies symmetry.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Group"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Set"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rubik's"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Game"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A(n) _____ chord is a chord that has been rearranged but contains the same notes", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Introverted"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Permutation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inverted"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Inverse"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "There are _____ possible permutations in a Rubik's cube puzzle", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "More than 500,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "57 million"}, {"label": "C", "text": "An infinite number of"}, {"label": "D", "text": "43 quintillion"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A group can be made of anything as long as the elements follow _____ rules", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "8"}, {"label": "B", "text": "4"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2"}, {"label": "D", "text": "5"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In a group containing the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3 and using addition as the operation, 3 + 3 = _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "6"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1"}, {"label": "D", "text": "3"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Shrink all that down so that it fits\nin the palm of your hand, and you'd have something equivalent\nto a modern hard drive, an object that can likely hold\nmore information than your local library. So how does it store so much information\nin such a small space? At the heart of every hard drive\nis a stack of high-speed spinning discs with a recording head \nflying over each surface. Each disc is coated with a film\nof microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data doesn't live there\nin a form you can recognize. Instead, it is recorded \nas a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grains. In each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have \ntheir magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes and ones. Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits \ninto electrical current fed through an electromagnet. This magnet generates a field\nstrong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's magnetization. Once this information is written \nonto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic reader\nto turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle\ntranslates a record's grooves into music. But how can you get so much information\nout of just zeroes and ones? Well, by putting lots of them together. For example, a letter is represented\nin one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo \ntakes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits. Because each bit must be written onto\na physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase\nthe disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed\ninto one square inch. The areal density of a modern hard drive\nis about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that\nof IBM's first hard drive from 1957. This amazing advance in storage capacity wasn't just a matter \nof making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations. A technique called the thin film\nlithography process allowed engineers \nto shrink the reader and writer. And despite its size, \nthe reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in\nmagnetic and quantum properties of matter. Bits could also be packed closer together\nthanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise\nfrom magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences\nfrom each chunk of read-back signal. And thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater \nunder the magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than\nfive nanometers above the disc's surface, about the width of two strands of DNA. For the past several decades, the exponential growth in computer\nstorage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern \nknown as Moore's Law, which, in 1975, predicted that information\ndensity would double every two years. But at around 100 gigabits \nper square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further\nor cramming them closer together posed a new risk\ncalled the superparamagnetic effect. When a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed\nby heat energy and can cause bits \nto switch unintentionally, leading to data loss. Scientists resolved this limitation\nin a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of recording\nfrom longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach\none terabit per square inch. Recently, the potential limit has been\nincreased yet again through heat assisted magnetic recording. This uses an even more thermally\nstable recording medium, whose magnetic resistance \nis momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot \nwith a laser and allowing data to be written. And while those drives are currently\nin the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential\ntrick up their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged \nin separate, nano-sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities\nof twenty terabits per square inch or more. So it's thanks to the combined efforts\nof generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power\nand precision can spin in the palm of your hand."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What components are in hard drives?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Magnetic disk"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Electromagnet writer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Magnetic sensor"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In this lesson, what causes data loss?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Heat energy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fly height"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Electrical noises"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Moore's law"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is not one of the innovations that help increasing areal density of hard drives?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Thin film lithography"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Thermal fly height control"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Mathematical algorithm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Superparamagnetic effect"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "It is predicted that perpendicular recording will push the areal density up to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100Gbit/in2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "600Gbit/in2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1Tbit/in2"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20Tbit/in2"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which technology is currently in the prototyping stage that will supersede perpendicular recording:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Longitudinal recording"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Solid state drive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Heat assisted magnetic recording"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bit-patterned media"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

The short answer is that no one\nwants to watch a starship crew spend years compiling an alien dictionary. But to keep things consistent, the creators of Star Trek\nand other science-fiction worlds have introduced the concept\nof a universal translator, a portable device that can instantly\ntranslate between any languages. So is a universal translator \npossible in real life? We already have many programs\nthat claim to do just that, taking a word, sentence, \nor entire book in one language and translating it into almost any other, whether it's modern English\nor Ancient Sanskrit. And if translation were just a matter\nof looking up words in a dictionary, these programs would run circles\naround humans. The reality, however, \nis a bit more complicated. A rule-based translation program\nuses a lexical database, which includes all the words \nyou'd find in a dictionary and all grammatical forms they can take, and set of rules to recognize the basic\nlinguistic elements in the input language. For a seemingly simple sentence like,\n\"The children eat the muffins,\" the program first parses its syntax,\nor grammatical structure, by identifying the children \nas the subject, and the rest of the sentence \nas the predicate consisting of a verb \"eat,\" and a direct object \"the muffins.\" It then needs to recognize\nEnglish morphology, or how the language can be broken down\ninto its smallest meaningful units, such as the word muffin and the suffix \"s,\" \nused to indicate plural. Finally, it needs to understand \nthe semantics, what the different parts of the sentence\nactually mean. To translate this sentence properly, the program would refer to a different set\nof vocabulary and rules for each element of the target language. But this is where it gets tricky. The syntax of some languages\nallows words to be arranged in any order, while in others, doing so could make\nthe muffin eat the child. Morphology can also pose a problem. Slovene distinguishes between\ntwo children and three or more using a dual suffix absent \nin many other languages, while Russian's lack of definite articles\nmight leave you wondering whether the children are eating \nsome particular muffins, or just eat muffins in general. Finally, even when the semantics\nare technically correct, the program might miss their finer points, such as whether the children \n\"mangiano\" the muffins, or \"divorano\" them. Another method is \nstatistical machine translation, which analyzes a database \nof books, articles, and documents that have already \nbeen translated by humans. By finding matches between source\nand translated text that are unlikely to occur by chance, the program can identify corresponding\nphrases and patterns, and use them for future translations. However, the quality \nof this type of translation depends on the size \nof the initial database and the availability of samples \nfor certain languages or styles of writing. The difficulty that computers have\nwith the exceptions, irregularities and shades of meaning\nthat seem to come instinctively to humans has led some researchers to believe\nthat our understanding of language is a unique product \nof our biological brain structure. In fact, one of the most famous\nfictional universal translators, the Babel fish from \n\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", is not a machine at all\nbut a small creature that translates the brain waves\nand nerve signals of sentient species through a form of telepathy. For now, learning a language\nthe old fashioned way will still give you better results than\nany currently available computer program. But this is no easy task, and the sheer number \nof languages in the world, as well as the increasing interaction\nbetween the people who speak them, will only continue to spur greater\nadvances in automatic translation.

You'd probably think that absurd,\nand, don't worry, it's completely wrong. Yet that's actually what people thought\ncaused diseases for several centuries. They called it miasma theory, and everyone from the public\nto the medical establishment accepted it. But by the 1840s, in the midst of\ndevastating cholera outbreaks in London, a small group of scientists \nhad grown skeptical. Early microscopes had revealed\nthe existence of tiny microorganisms, and they proposed that it was actually\nthese germs that cause diseases, hence the name germ theory. Though most people held \nonto their assumptions and strongly resisted this theory, its supporters were determined \nto prove them wrong by collecting compelling data. Leading the charge was a physician\nnamed Dr. John Snow. Dr. Snow observed that \ncholera-infected patients experienced severe vomiting and diarrhea, symptoms of the gut \nas opposed to the lungs, and thought that perhaps the disease\nwas transmitted through food or drink, not the air. After investigating previous outbreaks, he became convinced that cholera was spread\nthrough contaminated water sources. Then, late in the summer of 1854 when cholera suddenly struck\nthe Soho district, a neighborhood in London\nvery close to his own, Dr. Snow was hot on its trail. He requested the records for the deceased, and within the first week,\nthere had already been 83 deaths. He mapped out where each \nof the deceased had lived and found that 73 of them resided\nclose to the water pump on Broad Street. Dr. Snow strongly recommended \nshutting down the pump, and because he knew how unpopular\ngerm theory was, he suggested that cholera was spread\nthrough a poison in the water instead of microorganisms, when presenting his case\nto governmental officials. They were unconvinced, but agreed to shut down the pump\nas an extra precaution. Almost immediately, \nnew cases of infection subsided. Bolstered by his success, Dr. Snow was determined to connect\nthe contaminated pump water to the disease. He found the story of a widow \nwho had died of cholera and lived far away from Soho, but had a servant bring her water\nfrom the Broad Street pump daily because she liked the taste. He also discovered a workhouse located around the corner \nfrom the Broad Street pump that housed hundreds of people,\nbut only a handful had become infected, which Dr. Snow attributed to the fact that the workhouse \nhad its own private well. Finally, Dr. Snow heard of an infant who may have been one \nof the earliest victims of the outbreak. He learned that the child's dirty diapers had been thrown into a cesspool right next to the public water pump\non Broad Street. Again, Dr. Snow presented his case, but even then, \ncity officials spurned his theory, not wanting to admit that there \nwas human waste in London's water supply, or that they were wrong \nabout miasma theory, which was, after all, \nhundreds of years old. It wasn't until 1884 \nthat Dr. Snow's efforts were vindicated by Dr. Robert Koch, who isolated \nthe cholera-causing bacterium. Koch developed a technique \nto grow pure cultures, and through a series of experiments, definitively proved \nthat a specific bacterium directly cause disease. Major contributions to germ theory also came from prolific scientist \nLouis Pasteur, whose study of microorganisms led\nto the development of the first vaccines. By challenging assumptions \nwith data-driven research, these scientists discredited\nan age-old theory and sparked a revolution that was\nincredibly beneficial to public health. But all of this raises the question, what are the widely held \nscientific beliefs of today that our descendants will find ridiculous?

{"page": 42, "lesson": 24, "title": "Why do women have periods?", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-women-have-periods", "transcript": {"en": "A handful of species on Earth \nshare a seemingly mysterious trait: a menstrual cycle. We're one of the select few. Monkeys, apes, bats, humans,\nand possibly elephant shrews are the only mammals on Earth\nthat menstruate. We also do it more than any other animal, even though its a waste of nutrients\nand can be a physical inconvenience. So where's the sense in this\nuncommon biological process? The answer begins with pregnancy. During this process, the body's resources\nare cleverly used to shape a suitable environment for a fetus, creating an internal haven for a mother\nto nurture her growing child. In this respect, \npregnancy is awe-inspiring, but that's only half the story. The other half reveals that pregnancy\nplaces a mother and her child at odds. As for all living creatures, the human body evolved to promote\nthe spread of its genes. For the mother, that means\nshe should try to provide equally for all her offspring. But a mother and her fetus don't share\nexactly the same genes. The fetus inherits genes\nfrom its father, as well, and those genes can promote their own\nsurvival by extracting more than their fair share \nof resources from the mother. This evolutionary conflict of interests places a woman and her unborn child\nin a biological tug-of-war that plays out inside the womb. One factor contributing \nto this internal tussle is the placenta, the fetal organ that\nconnects to the mother's blood supply and nourishes the fetus while it grows. In most mammals, the placenta is confined\nbehind a barrier of maternal cells. This barrier lets the mother control\nthe supply of nutrients to the fetus. But in humans and a few other species, the placenta actually penetrates right\ninto the mother's circulatory system to directly access her blood stream. Through its placenta, the fetus\npumps the mother's arteries with hormones that keep them open to provide a permanent\nflow of nutrient-rich blood. A fetus with such unrestricted access\ncan manufacture hormones to increase the mother's blood sugar,\ndilate her arteries, and inflate her blood pressure. Most mammal mothers can expel\nor reabsorb embryos if required, but in humans, once the fetus is\nconnected to the blood supply, severing that connection \ncan result in hemorrhage. If the fetus develops poorly or dies, the mother's health is endangered. As it grows, a fetus's ongoing need\nfor resources can cause intense fatigue, high blood pressure, and conditions \nlike diabetes and preeclampsia. Because of these risks, pregnancy is always a huge, \nand sometimes dangerous, investment. So it makes sense that the body \nshould screen embryos carefully to find out which ones \nare worth the challenge. This is where menstruation fits in. Pregnancy starts with a process\ncalled implantation, where the embryo embeds itself\nin the endometrium that lines the uterus. The endometrium evolved to make\nimplantation difficult so that only the healthy embryos\ncould survive. But in doing so, it also selected for the most \nvigorously invasive embryos, creating an evolutionary feedback loop. The embryo engages in a complex,\nexquisitely timed hormonal dialogue that transforms the endometrium \nto allow implantation. What happens when \nan embryo fails the test? It might still manage to attach, or even get partly \nthrough the endometrium. As it slowly dies, it could leave \nits mother vulnerable to infection, and all the time, it may be emitting\nhormonal signals that disrupt her tissues. The body avoids this problem\nby simply removing every possible risk. Each time ovulation doesn't result\nin a healthy pregnancy, the womb gets rid \nof its endometrial lining, along with any unfertilized eggs,\nsick, dying, or dead embryos. That protective process \nis known as menstruation, leading to the period. This biological trait, \nbizarre as it may be, sets us on course \nfor the continuation of the human race."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which animals listed below have a menstrual cycle?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Apes and monkeys"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Humans"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bats"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The fetal organ that connects the mother's blood supply and nourishes the fetus while it grows is the:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stomach"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Placenta"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Vagina"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Uterus"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which body system does the placenta penetrate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Circulatory"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nervous"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Endocrine"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lymphatic"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The hormones the fetus pumps into the mother's blood can:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increase the mother's blood sugar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dilate the mother's arteries"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Inflate the mother's blood pressure"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "As the fetus in the human mother grows, its intense need for nutrients can cause:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "High blood pressure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fatigue"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Preeclampsia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Each time ovulation does not result in a healthy pregnancy, what occurs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The endometrial lining is shed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Unfertilized eggs and unhealthy embryos are removed"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Both A and B"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}
