I’m Anna Rothschild, and this is Gross Science. Every poop is a nugget of information. Poop records what we eat, where we live, even\nhow we died. So when archaeologists find the fossilized\npoop of ancient humans, they get kind of excited. These poop fossils are called coprolites,\nand they’re pretty rare. Although we make a lot of them, feces are\ntough to preserve. But there are a few ways poop manages to stick\naround for posterity. It can dry out—in caves or in a mummy’s\ndesiccated intestines. Particularly impressive poops can leave dents\nin the earth that get filled in—creating a cast and mold of the ancient bowel movement. And a turd can also turn to stone, when minerals\nin water slowly permeate and replace the molecules in the turd. Whatever else was in the poop gets mineralized\nas well. Take this nearly 8-inch, 1000-year-old Viking\nmonstrosity discovered in England. The poor Viking who created this treasure\nwas infested with tons of intestinal parasites like whipworms, which were preserved along\nwith the giant poo, illustrating just how squalid everyday life was back then. And this guy wasn’t an anomaly—archaeologists\nhave also found cesspits (essentially Viking sewers) that were filled with parasite eggs. Poop can also tell us who was living where. In Puerto Rico, the contents of 1-2 millennia-old\ncoprolites backed up the archaeological evidence that native populations on the island at the\ntime were two distinct cultural groups, with different diets, and different parasites. Fossilized turds can even shed light on ancient\nmurder mysteries. In Medieval Verona, the warlord Cangrande\ndella Scala—patron of the poet Dante Alighieri—died at the age of 38 after a severe bout of vomiting\nand diarrhea. Rumors of foul-play spread, though at the\ntime no one could prove it. But nearly 700 years later, researchers dug\nup the body and analyzed the feces that were preserved in the corpse’s rectum. They found out that he had ingested a poisonous\nplant before he died. And from the chamomile and mulberry pollen\npreserved in the poop as well, the researchers surmised that he drank a poisoned tea that\nkilled him. So the next time you grab your newspaper and\nhead to the bathroom, think about it not so much as going number 2, but as contributing\nto the archaeological record.
