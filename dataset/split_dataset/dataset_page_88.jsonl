Pate", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-fascinating-science-of-phantom-limbs-joshua-w-pate", "transcript": {"en": "The vast majority of people \nwho’ve lost a limb can still feel it— not as a memory or vague shape,\nbut in complete lifelike detail. They can flex their phantom fingers and sometimes even feel \nthe chafe of a watchband or the throb of an ingrown toenail. And astonishingly enough, occasionally even people born \nwithout a limb can feel a phantom. So what causes phantom limb sensations? The accuracy of these apparitions suggests that we have a map \nof the body in our brains. And the fact that it’s possible for someone who’s never had a limb \nto feel one implies we are born with at least \nthe beginnings of this map. But one thing sets the phantoms\nthat appear after amputation apart from their flesh \nand blood predecessors: the vast majority of them are painful. To fully understand phantom limbs \nand phantom pain, we have to consider the entire pathway \nfrom limb to brain. Our limbs are full of sensory neurons\nresponsible for everything from the textures we feel \nwith our fingertips to our understanding \nof where our bodies are in space. Neural pathways carry this sensory input\nthrough the spinal cord and up to the brain. Since so much of this path \nlies outside the limb itself, most of it remains \nbehind after an amputation. But the loss of a limb alters the way signals travel \nat every step of the pathway. At the site of an amputation, severed nerve endings can thicken \nand become more sensitive, transmitting distress signals \neven in response to mild pressure. Under normal circumstances, these signals would be curtailed \nin the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. For reasons we don’t fully understand,\nafter an amputation, there is a loss of this inhibitory\ncontrol in the dorsal horn, and signals can intensify. Once they pass through the spinal cord,\nsensory signals reach the brain. There, the somatosensory cortex \nprocesses them. The entire body is mapped in this cortex. Sensitive body parts \nwith many nerve endings, like the lips and hands, are represented by the largest areas. The cortical homunculus is a model \nof the human body with proportions based on the size of each\nbody part’s representation in the cortex, The amount of cortex devoted \nto a specific body part can grow or shrink based on how much sensory input \nthe brain receives from that body part. For example, representation of the left\nhand is larger in violinists than in non-violinists. The brain also increases \ncortical representation when a body part is injured in order to heighten sensations \nthat alert us to danger. This increased representation \ncan lead to phantom pain. The cortical map is also \nmost likely responsible for the feeling of body parts \nthat are no longer there, because they still \nhave representation in the brain. Over time, this representation may shrink\nand the phantom limb may shrink with it. But phantom limb sensations \ndon’t necessarily disappear on their own. Treatment for phantom pain \nusually requires a combination of physical therapy, medications for pain management, prosthetics, and time. A technique called mirror box therapy can be very helpful in developing \nthe range of motion and reducing pain in the phantom limb. The patient places the phantom limb \ninto a box behind a mirror and the intact limb \nin front of the mirror. This tricks the brain \ninto seeing the phantom rather than just feeling it. Scientists are developing \nvirtual reality treatments that make the experience \nof mirror box therapy even more lifelike. Prosthetics can also \ncreate a similar effect— many patients report pain primarily when they remove \ntheir prosthetics at night. And phantom limbs may in turn help patients conceptualize\nprosthetics as extensions of their bodies and manipulate them intuitively. There are still many questions \nabout phantom limbs. We don’t know why some amputees\nescape the pain typically associated \nwith these apparitions, or why some don’t have phantoms at all. And further research into phantom limbs isn’t just applicable to the people \nwho experience them. A deeper understanding \nof these apparitions will give us insight into the work\nour brains do every day to build the world as we perceive it.

To get some time alone together, the scholar and the wife \nplay various tricks that involve feigning madness, staging a biblical flood, and exposing themselves in public. But the parish clerk \nis also lusting after the wife, and comes by every night \nto sing outside her house. This becomes so tiresome \nthat she tries to scare him away by hanging her rear end out the window \nfor him to kiss. When this appears not to work, her scholar decides \nto try farting in the same position, but this time, the clerk \nis waiting with a red-hot poker. This might all sound like a bawdy joke, but it’s part of one of the most esteemed \nworks of English literature ever created: The Canterbury Tales, which seamlessly blends the lofty \nand the lowly. The work consists of 24 stories, each told by one \nof Chaucer’s spirited characters. Narrators include \nfamiliar Medieval figures such as a Knight, a Clerk, and a Nun, and the less recognizable Reeve, and Mancible, and others. The Tales are written in Middle English, which often looks entirely different \nfrom the language spoken today. It was used between the 12th \nand 15th centuries, and evolved from Old English due to increased contact \nwith European romantic languages after the Norman Conquest of 1066. Most of the Middle English alphabet \nis still familiar today, with the inclusion \nof a few archaic symbols, such as yogh, which denotes the y, j, or gh sound. The loquacious cast of the Tales \nfirst meet at the Tabard Inn in Southwark. They have a journey in common: a pilgrimage to Canterbury \nto visit the shrine of St. Thomas Beckett, a martyred archbishop who was murdered \nin his own Cathedral. Eager and nosy\nfor some personal details, the host of the Inn \nproposes a competition: whoever tells the best tale \nwill be treated to dinner. If not for their pilgrimage, many of these figures would never \nhave had the chance to interact. This is because Medieval society followed \na feudal system that divided the clergy and nobility \nfrom the working classes, made up of peasants and serfs. By Chaucer’s time, a professional class of merchants \nand intellectuals had also emerged. Chaucer spent most of his life \nas a government official during the Hundred Years' War, traveling throughout Italy and France,\nas well as his native England. This may have influenced\nthe panoramic vision of his work, and in the Tales,\nno level of society is above mockery. Chaucer uses the quirks \nof the characters’ language – the ribald humor of the Cook, the solemn prose of the Parson, and the lofty notions of the Squire – to satirize their worldviews. The varied dialects, genres, \nand literary tropes also make the work a vivid record of the different ways Medieval audiences \nentertained themselves. For instance, the Knight’s tale \nof courtly love, chivalry, and destiny riffs on romance, while the tales of working-class narrators\nare generally comedies filled with scatological language, sexual deviance, and slapstick. This variation \nincludes something for everyone, and that’s one reason why readers\ncontinue to delight in the work in both Middle English and translation. While the narrative runs \nto over 17,000 lines, it's apparently unfinished, as the prologue ambitiously \nintroduces 29 pilgrims and promises four stories apiece, and the innkeeper never crowns a victor. It’s possible that Chaucer was\nso caught up in his sumptuous creations that he delayed picking a winner - or perhaps he was so fond \nof each character that he just couldn’t choose. Whatever the reason, this means that every reader\nis free to judge; the question of who wins is up to you."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The Canterbury Tales is written in _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Ancient English"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Old English"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Middle English"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Modern English"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "The 24 tales are narrated by _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A knight"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Harry Bailey"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chaucer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Different characters"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The characters are together because of _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A funeral"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A battle"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A pilgrimage"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A banquet"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Characters include _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A reeve"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A nun"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A king"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A knight"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A reeve, a nun, and a knight"}], "correct_option": "E"}, {"question": "The Canterbury Tales is a finished work.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

Less than a century later, people \nrepeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. Each had their own host of detractors. Even some experts \ninsisted they wouldn’t catch on. Of course, we can’t predict exactly \nwhat the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict \nthat the technologies of the present will change the future. And recent research has revealed \na similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change \nin ourselves. Three psychologists documented\nour inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper \ncalled, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist \nFrancis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy \nwas the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way \nwe see ourselves as finished products at any given moment. The researchers recruited over \n7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. They asked half of these participants to\nreport their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics \nhad been ten years before. The other half described those features \nin their present selves, and predicted what \nthey would be ten years in the future. Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated \nthe degree of change each participant reported or predicted. For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes \nto the reported changes. So they compared the degree to which \n18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds \nreported they had changed. Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change \ncame up short compared to the changes \ntheir older counterparts recalled. 20-year-olds expected \nto still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer \nhad the same tastes. 30-year-olds predicted they’d still \nhave the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds \nhad lost touch with theirs. And 40-year-olds predicted \nthey’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. While older people changed less \nthan younger people on the whole, they underestimated \ntheir capacity for change just as much. Wherever we are in life,\nthe end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk \nof our personal change is behind us. One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest \nin future choices based on present preferences. On average, people are willing \nto pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician \nten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their \nfavorite musician from ten years ago. While the stakes involved\nin concert-going are low, we’re susceptible \nto similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. At the same time, \nthere’s no real way to predict what our preferences \nwill be in the future. Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult \nto make any long-term plans. So the end of history illusion \napplies to our individual lives, but what about the wider world? Could we be assuming that how things \nare now is how they will continue to be? If so, fortunately,\nthere are countless records to remind us that the world does change,\nsometimes for the better. Our own historical moment \nisn’t the end of history, and that can be just as much a source\nof comfort as a cause for concern."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When was the research paper discussed in this lesson published?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1983"}, {"label": "B", "text": "1993"}, {"label": "C", "text": "2003"}, {"label": "D", "text": "2013"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How many participants did this research involve?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "7"}, {"label": "B", "text": "70"}, {"label": "C", "text": "700"}, {"label": "D", "text": "7000"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which age group is the least susceptible to changes?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Young people"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Middle aged people"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Elderly people"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No difference"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the End of History Illusion about?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The relation between actual and perceived past changes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The relation between actual and expected future changes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The relation between past and future changes"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Liberal democracy"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Suppose that you would pay 50 dollars to see your favorite musician now.

{"page": 88, "lesson": 4, "title": "Why should you read Edgar Allan Poe? - Scott Peeples", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-should-you-read-edgar-allan-poe-scott-peeples", "transcript": {"en": "A high forehead topped \nby disheveled black hair, a sickly pallor, and a look of deep intelligence \nand deeper exhaustion in his dark, sunken eyes. Edgar Allan Poe’s image \nis not just instantly recognizable – it’s perfectly suited to his reputation. From the prisoner strapped \nunder a descending pendulum blade, to a raven who refuses \nto leave the narrator’s chamber, Poe’s macabre and innovative stories \nof gothic horror have left a timeless mark on literature. But just what is it that makes\nEdgar Allan Poe one of the greatest American authors? After all, horror was a popular\ngenre of the period, with many practitioners. Yet Poe stood out thanks to his\ncareful attention to form and style. As a literary critic, he identified two cardinal rules \nfor the short story form: it must be short enough \nto read in one sitting, and every word \nmust contribute to its purpose. By mastering these rules, Poe commands the reader’s attention and rewards them with an intense \nand singular experience – what Poe called the unity of effect. Though often frightening,\nthis effect goes far beyond fear. Poe’s stories use violence and horror\nto explore the paradoxes and mysteries of love, grief, and guilt, while resisting simple interpretations \nor clear moral messages. And while they often hint \nat supernatural elements, the true darkness they explore\nis the human mind and its propensity for self-destruction. In “The Tell-Tale Heart,”\na ghastly murder is juxtaposed with the killer’s \ntender empathy towards the victim – a connection that soon \nreturns to haunt him. The title character of \"Ligeia\"\nreturns from the dead through the corpse \nof her husband’s second wife – or at least the opium-addicted \nnarrator thinks she does. And when the protagonist \nof “William Wilson” violently confronts a man \nhe believes has been following him, he might just be staring \nat his own image in a mirror. Through his pioneering use \nof unreliable narrators, Poe turns readers into active participants who must decide when a storyteller\nmight be misinterpreting or even lying about the events \nthey’re relating. Although he’s best known \nfor his short horror stories, Poe was actually one of the most versatile and experimental writers \nof the nineteenth century. He invented the detective story \nas we know it, with “The Murders in the Rue Morgue,” followed by “The Mystery of Marie Roget” and “The Purloined Letter.” All three feature \nthe original armchair detective, C. Auguste Dupin, who uses his genius and unusual powers \nof observation and deduction to solve crimes that baffle the police. Poe also wrote satires of social \nand literary trends, and hoaxes that in some cases \nanticipated science fiction. Those included an account of \na balloon voyage to the moon, and a report of a dying patient \nput into a hypnotic trance so he could speak from the other side. Poe even wrote an adventure novel \nabout a voyage to the South Pole and a treatise on astrophysics, all while he worked as an editor, producing hundreds of pages \nof book reviews and literary theory. An appreciation of Poe’s career \nwouldn’t be complete without his poetry: haunting and hypnotic. His best-known poems are songs of grief, \nor in his words, “mournful and never-ending remembrance.” “The Raven,” in which the speaker \nprojects his grief onto a bird who merely repeats a single sound, made Poe famous. But despite his literary success, Poe lived in poverty \nthroughout his career, and his personal life was often \nas dark as his writing. He was haunted by the loss of his mother \nand his wife, who both died of tuberculosis \nat the age of 24. Poe struggled with alcoholism and frequently antagonized \nother popular writers. Much of his fame came from posthumous –\nand very loose – adaptations of his work. And yet, if he could’ve known \nhow much pleasure and inspiration his writing would bring to generations\nof readers and writers alike, perhaps it may have brought \na smile to that famously brooding visage."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which phrase best sums up Poe’s guiding principle for writing fiction?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Shock and awe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Unity of effect"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The iceberg principle"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Deep hidden meaning"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In which of these literary genres did Poe not publish?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Epic poem"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Adventure novel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Satire"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Detective fiction"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which of these figures is a character created by Poe?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Robinson Crusoe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "C.

With settlements on every continent, we can be found in the most isolated \ncorners of Earth’s jungles, oceans, and tundras. Our impact is so profound,\nmost scientists believe humanity has left a permanent mark \non Earth’s geological record. So what would happen if suddenly, \nevery human on Earth disappeared? With no one maintaining them, some\nof our creations backfire immediately. Hours after we disappear,\noil refineries malfunction, producing month-long blazes at\nplants like the ones in western India, the southern United States, and South Korea. In underground rail systems \nlike those in London, Moscow, and New York City, hundreds of drainage pumps are abandoned,\nflooding the tunnels in just three days. By the end of the first week,\nmost emergency generators have shut down, and once the fires have gone out, the earth goes dark \nfor the first time in centuries. After the first catastrophic month,\nchanges come more gradually. Within 20 years, sidewalks have been \ntorn apart by weeds and tree roots. Around this time, flooded tunnels erode \nthe streets above into urban rivers. In temperate climates, the cycle of seasons freezes \nand thaws these waterways, cracking pavement \nand concrete foundations. Leaking pipes cause the same reaction \nin concrete buildings, and within 200 winters, most skyscrapers \nbuckle and tumble down. In cities built in river deltas \nlike Houston, these buildings \neventually wash away completely - filling nearby tributaries \nwith crushed concrete. Rural and suburban areas \ndecay more slowly, but in largely unsurprising ways. Leaks, mold, bug \nand rodent infestations - all the usual enemies of the homeowner- now go uncontested. Within 75 years, most houses' \nsupporting beams have rotted and sagged, and the resulting collapsed heap \nis now home to local rodents and lizards. But in this post-human world, \n“local” has a new meaning. Our cities are full of imported plants, which now run wild across \ntheir adopted homes. Water hyacinth coat the waterways \nof Shanghai in a thick green carpet. Poisonous giant hogweeds overgrow\nthe banks of London’s Thames River. Chinese Ailanthus trees burst\nthrough New York City streets. And as sunken skyscrapers add\ncrumbled concrete to the new forest floor, the soil acidity plummets, potentially allowing \nnew plant life to thrive. This post-human biodiversity \nextends into the animal kingdom, as well. Animals follow the unchecked \nspread of native and non-native plants, venturing into new habitats \nwith the help of our leftover bridges. In general, our infrastructure \nsaves some animals and dooms others. Cockroaches continue to thrive \nin their native tropical habitats, but without our heating systems, their urban cousins likely freeze\nand die out in just two winters. And most domesticated animals \nare unable to survive without us – save for a handful of resourceful pigs, \ndogs, and feral housecats. Conversely, the reduced light pollution \nsaves over a billion birds each year whose migrations were disrupted \nby blinking communication tower lights and high-tension wires. And mosquitos multiply endlessly in one\nof their favorite manmade nurseries – rubber tires, which last \nfor almost a thousand years. As fauna and flora flourish, Earth’s climate slowly recovers \nfrom millennia of human impact. Within 35,000 years, the plant cycle removes\nthe last traces of lead left by the Industrial Revolution \nfrom Earth’s soil, and it may take \nup to 65,000 years beyond that for CO2 to return pre-human levels. But even after several million years,\nhumanity’s legacy lives on. Carved in unyielding granite, America’s Mt. Rushmore \nsurvives for 7.2 million years. The chemical composition \nof our bronze sculptures keeps them recognizable \nfor over 10 million. And buried deep underground, the remnants of cities \nbuilt on floodplains have been preserved in time \nas a kind of technofossil.

That’s hardly news--we’ve known \nabout the dangers of smoking for decades. But how exactly do cigarettes harm us? Let’s look at what happens \nas their ingredients make their way through our bodies, and how we benefit physically \nwhen we finally give up smoking. With each inhalation, smoke brings its more than 5,000 \nchemical substances into contact with the body’s tissues. From the start, tar, \na black, resinous material, begins to coat the teeth and gums, damaging tooth enamel, \nand eventually causing decay. Over time, smoke also damages \nnerve-endings in the nose, causing loss of smell. Inside the airways and lungs, smoke increases \nthe likelihood of infections, as well as chronic diseases\nlike bronchitis and emphysema. It does this by damaging the cilia, tiny hairlike structures whose job it is \nto keep the airways clean. It then fills the alveoli, tiny air sacs that enable the exchange \nof oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and blood. A toxic gas called carbon monoxide \ncrosses that membrane into the blood, binding to hemoglobin and displacing the oxygen it would usually have transported\naround the body. That’s one of the reasons smoking \ncan lead to oxygen deprivation and shortness of breath. Within about 10 seconds, the bloodstream carries a stimulant \ncalled nicotine to the brain, triggering the release of dopamine \nand other neurotransmitters including endorphins that create the pleasurable sensations \nwhich make smoking highly addictive. Nicotine and other chemicals \nfrom the cigarette simultaneously cause constriction \nof blood vessels and damage their delicate \nendothelial lining, restricting blood flow. These vascular effects lead \nto thickening of blood vessel walls and enhance blood platelet stickiness, increasing the likelihood \nthat clots will form and trigger heart attacks and strokes. Many of the chemicals inside cigarettes \ncan trigger dangerous mutations in the body’s DNA that make cancers form. Additionally, ingredients like arsenic \nand nickel may disrupt the process of DNA repair, thus compromising the body’s ability \nto fight many cancers. In fact, about one of every three \ncancer deaths in the United States is caused by smoking. And it’s not just lung cancer. Smoking can cause cancer \nin multiple tissues and organs, as well as damaged eyesight and weakened bones. It makes it harder \nfor women to get pregnant. And in men,\nit can cause erectile dysfunction. But for those who quit smoking, there’s a huge positive upside with almost immediate \nand long-lasting physical benefits. Just 20 minutes after \na smoker’s final cigarette, their heart rate and blood pressure\nbegin to return to normal. After 12 hours, \ncarbon monoxide levels stabilize, increasing the blood’s \noxygen-carrying capacity. A day after ceasing, heart attack risk begins to decrease as\nblood pressure and heart rates normalize. After two days, the nerve endings responsible \nfor smell and taste start to recover. Lungs become healthier \nafter about one month, with less coughing \nand shortness of breath.

Their target: England, \nhome to more than a million people. Theirs was a short voyage\nwith massive consequences. And around the same period of time, other groups of Normans\nwere setting forth all across Europe, going on adventures that would reverberate\nthroughout that continent’s history. So who were these warriors and how did they leave \ntheir mark so far and wide? Our story begins \nover 200 years earlier, when Vikings began to settle \non the shores of northern France as part of a great Scandinavian exodus \nacross northern Europe. The French locals called \nthese invaders Normans, named for the direction they came from. Eventually, Charles, \nthe king of the Franks, negotiated peace with \nthe Viking leader Rollo in 911, granting him a stretch of land \nalong France’s northern coast that came to be known as Normandy. The Normans proved adaptable\nto their newly settled life. They married Frankish women, adopted the French language, and soon started converting \nfrom Norse paganism to Christianity. But though they adapted, they maintained the warrior tradition and conquering spirit \nof their Viking forebears. Before long, ambitious Norman knights \nwere looking for new challenges. The Normans’ best-known achievement \nwas their conquest of England. In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, disputed the claim of \nthe new English king, Harold Godwinson. Soon after landing in England, William and his knights met Harold’s army \nnear the town of Hastings. The climactic moment in the battle is immortalized in \nthe 70-meter-long Bayeux Tapestry, where an arrow striking Harold \nin the eye seals the Norman victory. William consolidated his gains \nwith a huge castle-building campaign and a reorganization of English society. He lived up to his nickname \n\"William the Conqueror\" through a massive survey\nknown as the Domesday Book, which recorded the population\nand ownership of every piece of land in England. Norman French became the language \nof the new royal court, while commoners continued \nto speak Anglo-Saxon. Over time, the two merged \nto give us the English we know today, though the divide between lords \nand peasants can still be felt in synonym pairs such as cow and beef. By the end of the 12th century, the Normans had further expanded \ninto Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Meanwhile, independent groups \nof Norman knights traveled to the Mediterranean, inspired by tales of pilgrims \nreturning from Jerusalem. There, they threw themselves \ninto a tangled mass of conflicts among the established powers \nall over that region. They became highly prized mercenaries, and during one of these battles, they made the first recorded \nheavy cavalry charge with couched lances, a devastating tactic that soon became \nstandard in medieval warfare. The Normans were also central \nto the First Crusade of 1095-99, a bloody conflict that re-established\nChristian control in certain parts of the Middle East. But the Normans did more than just fight. As a result of their victories, leaders like William Iron-Arm \nand Robert the Crafty secured lands throughout Southern Italy, eventually merging them\nto form the Kingdom of Sicily in 1130. Under Roger II, the kingdom became a beacon of\nmulticultural tolerance in a world torn apart \nby religious and civil wars. Muslim Arab poets and scholars \nserved in the royal court alongside Byzantine Greek sailors \nand architects. Arabic remained an official language along\nwith Latin, Greek, and Norman French. The world’s geographical knowledge \nwas compiled in The Book of Roger, whose maps of the known world would remain the most accurate \navailable for 300 years. And the churches built in Palermo\ncombined Latin-style architecture, Arab ceilings, and Byzantine domes, all decorated with\nexquisite golden mosaics. So if the Normans were so successful,\nwhy aren’t they still around? In fact, this was a key part of\ntheir success: not just ruling the societies \nthey conquered, but becoming part of them. Although the Normans eventually \ndisappeared as a distinct group, their contributions remained. And today, from the castles and\ncathedrals that dot Europe’s landscape to wherever \nthe English language is spoken, the Norman legacy lives on."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where did the original Normans come from?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Normandy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Scandinavia"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Norway"}, {"label": "D", "text": "England"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When did the Normans invade England?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "911 AD"}, {"label": "B", "text": "966 AD"}, {"label": "C", "text": "1066 AD"}, {"label": "D", "text": "1086 AD"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What was the purpose of the Domesday Book?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "To carry out a census of all the conquered English peoples"}, {"label": "B", "text": "To reorganize the English legal system along Norman lines"}, {"label": "C", "text": "To record the details of how the Normans won the battle of Hastings"}, {"label": "D", "text": "To record the population and ownership of every piece of land in England"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Why was the Norman kingdom of Sicily considered a beacon of tolerance?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "King Roger II employed Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, and Normans in his government"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It was illegal to discriminate against other races"}, {"label": "C", "text": "King Roger II signed treaties with all leading powers of the medieval era"}, {"label": "D", "text": "King Roger II encouraged exploration of the New World"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What happened to the Normans in the end?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They were eventually defeated in battle"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They surrendered to the authority of the Pope"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They merged into the societies that they conquered"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They retreated back to their homeland"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

(hint: facts aren't always enough) - Hugo Mercier", "category": "Literature & Language", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-can-you-change-someone-s-mind-spoiler-facts-don-t-work-so-well-hugo-mercier", "transcript": {"en": "Three people are at a dinner party. Paul, who’s married, is looking at Linda. Meanwhile, Linda is looking at John, \nwho’s not married. Is someone who’s married looking \nat someone who’s not married? Take a moment to think about it. Most people answer that there’s \nnot enough information to tell. And most people are wrong. Linda must be either married \nor not married—there are no other options. So in either scenario, someone married \nis looking at someone who’s not married. When presented with the explanation, \nmost people change their minds and accept the correct answer, despite being very confident \nin their first responses. Now let’s look at another case. A 2005 study by Brendan Nyhan \nand Jason Reifler examined American attitudes regarding \nthe justifications for the Iraq War. Researchers presented participants \nwith a news article that showed no weapons \nof mass destruction had been found. Yet many participants not only continued \nto believe that WMDs had been found, but they even became more convinced \nof their original views. So why do arguments change people’s minds \nin some cases and backfire in others? Arguments are more convincing when they \nrest on a good knowledge of the audience, taking into account \nwhat the audience believes, who they trust, and what they value. Mathematical and logical arguments \nlike the dinner party brainteaser work because even when people \nreach different conclusions, they’re starting from \nthe same set of shared beliefs. In 1931, a young, unknown mathematician \nnamed Kurt Gödel presented a proof that a logically complete\nsystem of mathematics was impossible. Despite upending decades of\nwork by brilliant mathematicians like Bertrand Russell and David Hilbert, the proof was accepted because it relied on axioms that \neveryone in the field already agreed on. Of course, many disagreements involve \ndifferent beliefs that can’t simply be reconciled\nthrough logic. When these beliefs involve \noutside information, the issue often comes down to\nwhat sources and authorities people trust. One study asked people to estimate \nseveral statistics related to the scope of climate change. Participants were asked questions, such as “how many of the years \nbetween 1995 and 2006 were one of the hottest 12 years \nsince 1850?” After providing their answers, they were presented with data from the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in this case showing that the answer \nwas 11 of the 12 years. Being provided with these reliable \nstatistics from a trusted official source made people more likely to accept \nthe reality that the earth is warming. Finally, for disagreements that \ncan’t be definitively settled with statistics or evidence, making a convincing argument may depend on engaging \nthe audience’s values. For example, researchers have conducted \na number of studies where they’ve asked people \nof different political backgrounds to rank their values. Liberals in these studies, \non average, rank fairness— here meaning whether everyone is treated \nin the same way—above loyalty. In later studies, researchers attempted \nto convince liberals to support military spending with \na variety of arguments. Arguments based on fairness— like that the military provides employment and education to people \nfrom disadvantaged backgrounds— were more convincing than arguments \nbased on loyalty— such as that the military \nunifies a nation. These three elements— beliefs, trusted sources, and values— may seem like a simple formula \nfor finding agreement and consensus. The problem is that our initial \ninclination is to think of arguments that rely on our own beliefs, \ntrusted sources, and values. And even when we don’t, it can be challenging to correctly \nidentify what’s held dear by people who don’t already agree with us. The best way to find out\nis simply to talk to them. In the course of discussion, you’ll be exposed to counter-arguments\nand rebuttals. These can help you make your own \narguments and reasoning more convincing and sometimes, you may even end up \nbeing the one changing your mind."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Frequently, what elements must an argument take into account to be convincing?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A person's beliefs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Trusted sources"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A person's values"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "In one study, why were some people willing to change their opinion on climate change?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They received free ice cream"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They were presented with reliable statistics from a trusted official source"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They watched an ice cap melt"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No one changed their mind"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What happened in a study that examined American attitudes regarding the justifications for the Iraq War?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Participants changed their minds when presented with new information"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Participants refused to read the article"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Participants became more convinced of their original views"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Participants never showed up to the study"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Why are mathematical arguments more likely to change people’s minds?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They start from the same set of shared beliefs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They are entertaining and easy to understand"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They confuse people"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Why are arguments a worthy form of debate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Arguments should be avoided at all costs"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They expose you to counterarguments, which help make your own arguments and reasoning more convincing—and sometimes change your mind"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They allow you to yell at someone"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They are only worthy if the other person agrees with you"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

As the sunlight brightens the Nile, \nPeseshet checks her supplies. Honey, garlic, cumin, acacia leaves, cedar oil. She’s well stocked with the essentials \nshe needs to treat her patients. Peseshet is a swnw, or a doctor. In order to become one, she had to train as a scribe and study the medical papyri stored \nat the Per Ankh, the House of Life. Now, she teaches her own students there. Before teaching, \nPeseshet has a patient to see. One of the workers at the temple \nconstruction site has injured his arm. When Peseshet arrives, the laborer’s arm is clearly broken, and worse, the fracture is a sed, \nwith multiple bone fragments. Peseshet binds and immobilizes the injury. Her next stop is the House of Life. On her way, a woman intercepts \nPeseshet in the street. The woman’s son \nhas been stung by a scorpion. Peseshet has seen many similar stings \nand knows exactly what to do. She must say an incantation \nto cast the poison out. She begins to recite the spell, invoking Serqet, patron of physicians \nand goddess of venomous creatures. Peseshet recites the spell \nas if she is Serqet. This commanding approach \nhas the greatest chance at success. After she utters the last line, she tries to cut the poison out \nwith a knife for good measure. Peseshet packs up to leave,\nbut the woman has another question. She wants to find out if she is pregnant. Peseshet explains \nher fail-safe pregnancy test: plant two seeds: one barley, one emmer. Then, urinate on the seeds every day. If the plants grow, she’s pregnant. A barley seedling predicts a baby boy, while emmer foretells a girl. Peseshet also recommends a prayer\nto Hathor, goddess of fertility. When Peseshet finally arrives \nat the House of Life, she runs into the doctor-priest Isesi. She greets Isesi politely, but she thinks\npriests are very full of themselves. She doesn’t envy Isesi’s role \nas neru pehut, which directly translates to herdsman \nof the anus to the royal family, or, guardian of the royal anus. Inside, the House of Life is bustling \nas usual with scribes, priests, doctors, and students. Papyri containing all kinds of records, \nnot just medical information, are stored here. Peseshet’s son Akhethetep is hard \nat work copying documents as part of his training \nto become a scribe. He’s a particularly promising student, but he was admitted to study \nbecause Peseshet is a scribe, as was her father before her. Without family in the profession, it’s very difficult for boys, \nand impossible for girls, to pursue this education. Peseshet oversees all the female \nswnws and swnws-in-training in Memphis. The men have their own overseer, as the male doctors \nwon’t answer to a woman. Today, Peseshet teaches anatomy. She quizzes her students on the metu, the body’s vessels that transport blood, air, urine, and even bad spirits. Peseshet is preparing to leave when a pale, thin woman accosts her \nat the door and begs to be examined. The woman has a huge, \nsore lump under her arm. Peseshet probes the growth \nand finds it cool to the touch and hard like an unripe hemat fruit. She has read about ailments \nlike this, but never seen one. For this tumor there is no treatment, \nmedicine or spell. All the texts give the same advice: \ndo nothing. After delivering the bad news, \nPeseshet goes outside. She lingers on the steps\nof the House of Life, admiring the city at dusk. In spite of all her hard work, there will always be patients \nshe can’t help, like the woman with the tumor.

Now imagine trying to do it using \nonly the numbers 1 and 0. Every time you use the Internet\nto watch a movie, listen to music, or check directions, that’s exactly what your device is doing, using the language of binary code. Computers use binary because \nit's a reliable way of storing data. For example, a computer's main\nmemory is made of transistors that switch between either high \nor low voltage levels, such as 5 volts and 0 volts. Voltages sometimes oscillate,\nbut since there are only two options, a value of 1 volt \nwould still be read as \"low.\" That reading is done by \nthe computer’s processor, which uses the transistors’ states \nto control other computer devices according to software instructions. The genius of this system \nis that a given binary sequence doesn't have a pre-determined meaning \non its own. Instead, each type of data\nis encoded in binary according to a separate \nset of rules. Let’s take numbers. In normal decimal notation,  each digit is multiplied by 10 raised \nto the value of its position, starting from zero on the right. So 84 in decimal form is 4x10⁰ + 8x10¹. Binary number notation works similarly, but with each position \nbased on 2 raised to some power. So 84 would be written as follows: Meanwhile, letters are interpreted \nbased on standard rules like UTF-8, which assigns each character to a specific\ngroup of 8-digit binary strings. In this case, 01010100 corresponds \nto the letter T. So, how can you know whether \na given instance of this sequence is supposed to mean T or 84? Well, you can’t from seeing \nthe string alone – just as you can’t tell what the sound\n\"da\" means from hearing it in isolation. You need context to tell whether you're\nhearing Russian, Spanish, or English. And you need similar context to tell whether you’re looking \nat binary numbers or binary text. Binary code is also used for \nfar more complex types of data. Each frame of this video, for instance, is made of hundreds \nof thousands of pixels. In color images, every pixel is represented \nby three binary sequences that correspond to the primary colors. Each sequence encodes a number that determines\nthe intensity of that particular color. Then, a video driver program transmits \nthis information to the millions of liquid crystals \nin your screen to make all the different hues \nyou see now. The sound in this video \nis also stored in binary, with the help of a technique \ncalled pulse code modulation. Continuous sound waves are digitized by taking \"snapshots\" of their \namplitudes every few milliseconds. These are recorded as numbers \nin the form of binary strings, with as many as 44,000\nfor every second of sound. When they’re read by \nyour computer’s audio software, the numbers determine how quickly \nthe coils in your speakers should vibrate to create sounds of different frequencies. All of this requires billions \nand billions of bits. But that amount can be reduced \nthrough clever compression formats. For example, if a picture has 30 adjacent \npixels of green space, they can be recorded as \"30 green\" instead\nof coding each pixel separately - a process known as run-length encoding. These compressed formats are themselves \nwritten in binary code. So is binary the end-all-be-all \nof computing? Not necessarily. There’s been research \ninto ternary computers, with circuits in three possible states, and even quantum computers, whose circuits can be\nin multiple states simultaneously. But so far, none of these has provided as much physical stability \nfor data storage and transmission. So for now, everything you see, hear, and read through your screen comes to you as the result \nof a simple \"true\" or \"false\" choice, made billions of times over."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many different \"quantities\" can be expressed with a binary sequence of 8 bits?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Only 2"}, {"label": "B", "text": "26, the letters of the alphabet"}, {"label": "C", "text": "256, equivalent to 2^8"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Infinite"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do you know if a binary sequence corresponds to a number, text, color, or audio?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Machine-learning techniques can infer the type of the binary data"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The programmer who created the data will provide the context necessary to define it, similar to a user that creates a file with an appropriate extension"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There is absolutely no way to know"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which sentence best describes the way a color is represented in binary when considering the RGB system?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Each color is associated with three numbers and the binary representation of the color is given by those numbers' binary representation"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The binary representation of a color is equivalent to the energy of its associated photons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The characters that compose the name of the color in English define its representation in binary"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The wave corresponding to a color is registered at 40 MHz and the intensity of each sample is stored in memory"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the frequency of an audio recording?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "22 Hz"}, {"label": "B", "text": "44Hz"}, {"label": "C", "text": "44 kHz"}, {"label": "D", "text": "220 kHz"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How can one compress a picture encoded in binary into a smaller file without loss of information?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Half of the information stored in binary is not actually needed to store it, so it can simply be suppressed"}, {"label": "B", "text": "We can store more data in smaller devices because of the recent advances in technology that follow Moore's law"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When you compress a picture, you are actually creating a shortcut to some region of the main memory; since the shortcut takes less memory than the file, we have the impression it is compressed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Pictures usually have pixels that are very similar to their surrounding pixels; instead of storing every single one of them, the compressor software can store only the first one, as well as the number of times it must be repeated"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

They’re not at the top of Mount Everest or buried in a glacier. They’re in physics labs: clouds of gases held just fractions\nof a degree above absolute zero. That’s 395 million times colder \nthan your refrigerator, 100 million times colder \nthan liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder\nthan outer space. Temperatures this low give scientists a\nwindow into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build \nincredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in \nthe farthest reaches of the universe. How do we create such \nextreme temperatures? In short, by slowing down \nmoving particles. When we’re talking about temperature,\nwhat we’re really talking about is motion. The atoms that make up solids, liquids, and gases are moving all the time. When atoms are moving more rapidly,\nwe perceive that matter as hot. When they’re moving more\nslowly, we perceive it as cold. To make a hot object \nor gas cold in everyday life, we place it in a colder environment, \nlike a refrigerator. Some of the atomic motion in the hot\nobject is transferred to the surroundings, and it cools down. But there’s a limit to this: even outer space is too warm\nto create ultra-low temperatures. So instead, scientists figured out a way \nto slow the atoms down directly – with a laser beam. Under most circumstances, the energy in a laser beam \nheats things up. But used in a very precise way, the beam’s momentum can stall \nmoving atoms, cooling them down. That’s what happens in a device \ncalled a magneto-optical trap. Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber, and a magnetic field \ndraws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed \nat the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb\na photon of the laser beam and slow down. The slow down effect comes from\nthe transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon. A total of six beams, \nin a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling \nin all directions will be intercepted. At the center, where the beams intersect, the atoms move sluggishly, \nas if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it \ndescribed as “optical molasses.” A magneto-optical trap like this can cool atoms down \nto just a few microkelvins — about -273 degrees Celsius. This technique was developed in the 1980s, and the scientists \nwho'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997\nfor the discovery. Since then, laser cooling has been \nimproved to reach even lower temperatures. But why would you want \nto cool atoms down that much? First of all, cold atoms can make\nvery good detectors. With so little energy, they’re incredibly sensitive \nto fluctuations in the environment. So they’re used in devices that find \nunderground oil and mineral deposits, and they also make \nhighly accurate atomic clocks, like the ones used \nin global positioning satellites. Secondly, cold atoms hold \nenormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. Their extreme sensitivity \nmakes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves \nin future space-based detectors. They’re also useful for the study \nof atomic and subatomic phenomena, which requires measuring incredibly \ntiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms. Those are drowned out \nat normal temperatures, when atoms speed around \nat hundreds of meters per second.

{"page": 88, "lesson": 12, "title": "The physics of roller coasters", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/Acrfo8Xj", "transcript": {"en": "Imagine being strapped into a big chunk\nof metal raised over a hundred twenty meters into the sky and then dropped\nwhizzing over hills and even looping upside down. When you put it that way roller coasters can seem a little\nterrifying but they're also exhilarating and involve some really interesting\nphysics make all those speedy gut dropping thrills work. Most roller\ncoasters start off with something called a lift hill, which mechanically lifts you to\nthe top of the first and tallest hill. But other roller coasters start a little\nmore suddenly. They're rapidly propelled forward thanks the hydraulics - the branch\nof physics that deals with fluids and how different mechanical forces affect\nthem. Hydraulic launch systems work by using a cable that's attached to two\nimportant pieces: a catch-car which connects to the bottom of\nthe roller coaster train and a giant winch which is basically a huge spool\nthat winds the cable when it's turned by some motor. So, to launch the train this\ncable pulls it down the tracks like reeling in a fish really fast. After a\nfew seconds the Catch-car releases the train so it can zoom up the big hill. It's\nkind of a complex mechanism but we'll go over the basics. The hydraulic fluid and some\nnitrogen gas are separated by a piston inside this chamber called the hydraulic\naccumulator. And the key to these launch systems is the fact that liquids, like\nhydraulic fluid, are incompressible. So the hydraulic fluid is pumped into the\naccumulator and compresses the nitrogen gas so there's more gas molecules\nbouncing around in a smaller space, which increases the pressure. Nitrogen gas is\ncheap, easy to get, and won't react dangerously to heat and high pressure.\nBasically no huge explosions. And once the pressure is high enough, a valve is\nopened and the hydraulic fluid rushes out to power a bunch of motors, which\nturn the winch, which pulls the cable and accelerates the train. Just like that,\nwithin a couple seconds you're speeding along at hundreds of kilometers per hour.\nSo now that the ride started you've made it to the top of the first hill and you\nstart to head over the other side you might feel something weird. Like besides\nthe adrenaline or other chemicals that give you that exciting rush. There's that\nsinking feeling in your stomach and you might feel weightless. That's because\nyou're in freefall - meaning that gravity is the only force acting on your body.\nNormally throughout the day you're able to feel your weight because something\nlike the ground or a chair is pushing back on your body from your feet to your\nbones and organs. But when you're in freefall you're not being supported by\nanything, so there isn't a force pushing upward on you. You're just accelerating toward\nthe earth at 9.8 meters per second squared like any other falling object.\nNow all good or slightly terrifying things have to come to an end so the\nroller coaster train needs to stop somehow. Traditionally roller coasters\nuse breaks that coming contact with a speeding train like\nsomething that skids along the bottom or clamps that close round metal fins on\nthe cars. These breaks rely on friction which causes the kinetic energy, the\nenergy of motion, to be converted into heat energy and stops the train. And\nthese brakes work but they get worn out from all this contact. But there are some\nbreaks that don't involve friction. They work by moving a conductor like the\nmetal pins sticking out from the train through a magnetic field. A magnetic\nfield can be produced by electric currents, like the currents running\nthrough a wire or the microscopic currents formed by electrons moving\nwithin atoms, which is kinda helped permanent magnets work. So on the tracks\nof some roller coasters there are rows of permanent magnets that create a\nmagnetic field. And when the metal fins pass through the magnetic field it\ninduces a ring-like current called an eddy current. This has to do with Lenz's\nlaw which essentially tells us that conductors like these metal fins don't\nlike change. So when the fins enter a magnetic field that wasn't there before,\nthey'll create a current that makes its own magnetic field that opposes this\nchange. The train will slow down because the kinetic energy of the moving train\nis dissipated as heat by the eddy currents flowing through the metal. And\neventually the train comes to a stop all without friction. So whether you love 'em\nor hate 'em, hopefully knowing some of the physics behind roller coasters can\nmake you appreciate them a little more.

But do these expressions look the same and communicate the same\nmeaning around the world, regardless of culture? Is one person’s smile another’s grimace? Charles Darwin theorized that emotional \nexpression was a common human feature. But he was in the minority. Until the mid-20th century, many researchers believed \nthat the specific ways we show emotion were learned behaviors \nthat varied across cultures. Personality theorist Silvan Tomkins \nwas one of the few to insist otherwise. Tomkins claimed that certain affects— emotional states and their associated \nfacial expressions— were universal. In the 1960s, psychologist Paul Ekman \nset about testing this theory by examining hundreds \nof hours of film footage of remote tribes isolated \nfrom the modern world. Ekman found the native peoples’ \nexpressions to be not only familiar, but occurring in precisely \nthe situations he would expect. Conversely, he ran tests with tribes who\nhad no prior exposure to Western culture. They were able to correctly match photos\nof different facial expressions with stories designed \nto trigger particular feelings. Over the next few decades, further research has\ncorroborated Darwin’s idea that some of our most important emotional\nexpressions are in fact universal. The degrees of expression appropriate \nto a given situation can, however, vary greatly across cultures. For instance, researchers \nhave studied facial expression in people who are born blind, hypothesizing that \nif expressions are universal, they would be displayed \nin the same way as sighted people. In one study, both blind \nand sighted athletes displayed the same expressions of emotion\nwhen winning or losing their matches. Further evidence can be found \nin our evolutionary relatives. Comparisons of facial expression\nbetween humans and non-human mammals have found similarities in the structure \nand movement of facial muscles. Chimpanzee laughter \nlooks different from ours, but uses some of the same \nmuscle movements. Back in the 60s, Ekman identified \nsix core expressions. Anger is accompanied by lowered\neyebrows drawn together, tense and narrowed eyes, and tight lips; disgust, by the lips pulled up\nand the nose crinkling. In fear, the upper white of the eyes \nare revealed as the eyebrows raise and the mouth stretches open, while surprise looks similar, but with rounded eyebrows \nand relaxed lips. Sadness is indicated by the inner corners \nof the eyebrows being drawn inwards and upwards, drooping eyes, and a downturned mouth. And of course there’s happiness: lips drawn up and back, and raised cheeks causing wrinkling \naround the eyes. More recently, researchers \nhave proposed additional entries such as contempt, shame, and disapproval, but opinions vary \non how distinct boundaries between these categories can be drawn. So if Ekman and other researchers \nare correct, what makes certain expressions universal? And why are they expressed \nin these particular ways? Scientists have a lot of theories rooted \nin our evolutionary history. One is that certain expressions \nare important for survival. Fear and surprise could signal \nto others an immediate danger. Studies of humans and some other primates have found that we pay more attention \nto faces that signal threats over neutral faces, particularly when we’re already \non high alert. Expressions also could \nhelp improve group fitness by communicating our internal states \nto those around us. Sadness, for example, signals to the group\nthat something’s wrong. There’s some evidence that expressions might be even more directly linked \nto our physiology. The fear expression, for instance, could directly improve survival \nin potentially dangerous situations by letting our eyes absorb more light and our lungs take in more air, \npreparing us to fight or flee. There’s still much research to be done \nin understanding emotional expression, particularly as we learn more about \nthe inner workings of the brain.

Behind the scenes, the endocrine system works \nconstantly to orchestrate these changes. Alongside growth and sexual maturity, this system regulates everything \nfrom your sleep to the rhythm of your beating heart, exerting its influence over each \nand every one of your cells. The endocrine system relies \non interactions between three features to do its job: glands, hormones, and trillions of cell receptors. Firstly, there are several\nhormone-producing glands: three in your brain, and seven in the rest of your body. Each is surrounded by \na network of blood vessels, from which they extract ingredients \nto manufacture dozens of hormones. Those hormones are then\npumped out in tiny amounts, usually into the bloodstream. From there, each hormone needs \nto locate a set of target cells in order to bring about a specific change. To find its targets, \nit’s helped along by receptors, which are special proteins inside \nor on the cell’s surface. Those receptors recognise\nspecific hormones as they waft by, and bind to them. When this happens, that hormone-receptor combination \ntriggers a range of effects that either increase or decrease \nspecific processes inside the cell to change the way that cell behaves. By exposing millions of cells at a time to hormones\nin carefully-regulated quantities, the endocrine system drives \nlarge-scale changes across the body. Take, for instance, the thyroid \nand the two hormones it produces, triiodothyronine and thyroxine. These hormones travel to most \nof the body’s cells, where they influence how quickly \nthose cells use energy and how rapidly they work. In turn, that regulates everything \nfrom breathing rate to heartbeat, body temperature, and digestion. Hormones also have some of their most\nvisible—and familiar—effects during puberty. In men, puberty begins when \nthe testes start secreting testosterone. That triggers the gradual development \nof the sexual organs, makes facial hair sprout, and causes the voice to deepen and height to increase. In women, estrogen secreted from the\novaries signals the start of adulthood. It helps the body develop, makes the hips widen, and thickens the womb’s lining, preparing the body \nfor menstruation or pregnancy. An enduring misconception around \nthe endocrine system is that there are exclusively male \nand female hormones. In fact, men and women \nhave estrogen and testosterone, just in different amounts. Both hormones play a role \nin pregnancy, as well, alongside more than 10 other hormones\nthat ensure the growth of the fetus, enable birth, and help the mother feed her child. Such periods of hormonal change are also\nassociated with fluctuations in mood. That’s because hormones can influence the production of certain chemicals \nin the brain, like serotonin. When chemical levels shift,\nthey may cause changes in mood, as well. But that’s not to say that hormones \nhave unlimited power over us. They’re frequently viewed as the main \ndrivers of our behavior, making us slaves to their effects,\nespecially during puberty. But research shows that our behavior \nis collectively shaped by a variety of influences, including the brain \nand its neurotransmitters, our hormones, and various social factors. The primary function \nof the endocrine system is to regulate our bodily processes, \nnot control us. Sometimes disease, stress, and even diet can disrupt \nthat regulatory function, however, altering the quantity of hormones \nthat glands secrete or changing the way that cells respond. Diabetes is one of the most \ncommon hormonal disorders, occurring when the pancreas \nsecretes too little insulin, a hormone that manages blood sugar levels. And hypo- and hyperthyroidism occur when the thyroid gland makes\ntoo little or too much thyroid hormone. When there’s too little thyroid hormone,\nthat results in a slowed heart rate, fatigue, and depression, and when there’s too much \nthyroid hormone, weight loss, sleeplessness, and irritability. But most of the time, the endocrine system manages to keep \nour bodies in a state of balance. And through its constant regulation, it drives the changes that ultimately\nhelp us become who we are."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Diabetes is a disease triggered by hormone imbalance, occurring when ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Adrenaline levels are imbalanced"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The liver secretes too much insulin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There is too much insulin in the blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The pancreas secretes too little insulin"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The main elements of the endocrine system are ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The glands, hormones, and cell receptors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The glands, nerves, and blood vessels"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The blood, tissue, and brain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The hormones, blood, and brain"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Hormones cause specific effects by ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Flooding the entire body"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Targeting specific parts of the brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Targeting specific groups of cells in the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Spreading through the nervous system"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "There are ______ main hormone-producing glands in the body.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "7"}, {"label": "B", "text": "16"}, {"label": "C", "text": "10"}, {"label": "D", "text": "8"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Diabetes is a disease triggered by hormone imbalance, occurring when ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Adrenaline levels are imbalanced"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The liver secretes too much insulin"}, {"label": "C", "text": "There is too much insulin in the blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The pancreas secretes too little insulin"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Men and women have completely different hormones.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}

(Explosion) All right, all right. So more than just explosions, chemistry is everywhere. Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over? Some people nodding yes. Recently, I showed this to my students, and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened. The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating. Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening. (Clang) (Laughs) Now obviously, as Maddie's chemistry teacher, I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class. But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level. If you look inside that beaker, you might see a candle. Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario. You know, questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers, and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education. But if we place these technologies before student inquiry, we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers: our students' questions. For example, flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time, but if it is the focus of our students' experience, it's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing. But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students, perplex them, and evoke real questions, through those questions, we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction. So, 21st-century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside, the truth is, I've been teaching for 13 years now, and it took a life-threatening situation to snap me out of 10 years of pseudo-teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning, not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information. In May of 2010, at 35 years old, with a two-year-old at home and my second child on the way, I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta. This led to open-heart surgery. This is the actual real email from my doctor right there. Now, when I got this, I was -- press Caps Lock -- absolutely freaked out, okay? But I found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied. Where did this guy get this confidence, the audacity of it? So when I asked him, he told me three things. He said first, his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure, about what worked and what didn't work. Second, he embraced, and didn't fear, the messy process of trial and error, the inevitable process of trial and error. And third, through intense reflection, he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure, and then, with a steady hand, he saved my life. Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom, and before I went back into the classroom that fall, I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today. Rule number one: Curiosity comes first. Questions can be windows to great instruction, but not the other way around. Rule number two: Embrace the mess. We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly. And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section 1.2 of chapter one of the one that we all skip, okay, trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room 206. And rule number three: Practice reflection. What we do is important. It deserves our care, but it also deserves our revision. Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms? As if what we are doing one day will save lives. Our students our worth it. And each case is different. (Explosion) All right. Sorry. The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on. So these are my daughters. On the right we have little Emmalou -- Southern family. And, on the left, Riley. Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here. She's going to be four years old, and anyone who knows a four-year-old knows that they love to ask, \"Why?\" Yeah. Why. I could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything. We all were at that age. But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers, the ones she has yet to meet. How will they grow this curiosity? You see, I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids, and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms -- to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom. But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry, we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day, and spark their imagination. Thank you very much. (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}

Before the year was out, she would begin a fight that would \nsave thousands of lives, though no one knew it at the time. Although she was new to the FDA,\nKelsey was no novice as a scientist. After graduating \nfrom high school at age 15, she enrolled \nat McGill University in Montreal and earned both undergraduate \nand master’s degrees in pharmacology. From there, she applied\nfor a research post at the University of Chicago’s\npharmacology department. Her acceptance letter was addressed \nto Mr. Oldham. Kelsey later joked that had her name \nbeen Elizabeth or Mary Jane, her career might have ended there. Fortunately, it didn’t. She earned her doctorate\nin pharmacology and accepted Chicago’s invitation \nto stay as faculty, where she undertook pioneering\nresearch on drugs and fetal safety. In 1950, she earned an MD, \nher fourth and final degree. By the time she joined the FDA, Frances Kelsey was one of the most\neducated, experienced scientists around. Yet, as the newest member\nof the team, Kelsey was assigned what everyone \nthought would be an easy review: an application from the\nUS drug company Merrell to sell a drug called thalidomide. Thalidomide was a sedative \ndeveloped in Germany that was already being widely used \nin dozens of countries to treat insomnia and workplace stress. Thalidomide’s anti-nausea properties also made it a popular remedy for pregnant\nwomen with morning sickness. Reviewing Merrell’s application, Kelsey found its data on thalidomide’s\nabsorption and toxicity inadequate. Today, the FDA classifies drugs based \non their safety for a fetus. But in 1960, many experts believed \nthat the placental barrier shielded a fetus from harm. Kelsey's earlier animal-based research demonstrated the opposite: drugs could pass from mother \nto fetus through the placenta. Like other drug companies at this time, Merrell had not tested its drug \non pregnant animals. Kelsey later said Merrell’s evidence \nfor thalidomide’s safety seemed “more like testimonials than\nthe results of well-designed studies.” Kelsey rejected Merrell’s application and asked them to submit a second \nbacked by better evidence. Her FDA colleagues \nsupported this decision. Merrell had expected a quick, \naffirmative reply so it could launch thalidomide\nfor the holiday season, when sedative sales soar. Instead of supplying Kelsey\nwith the data she requested they first tried to convince her\nto approve the drug over a series of calls and visits. When these failed to sway her, Merrell executives complained that stubborn and nit-picking \nKelsey was the problem, not thalidomide. The FDA backed Kelsey, forcing Merrell to file \nanother application, and another, and another. As Kelsey reviewed \nand rejected each new application, news of thalidomide’s adverse \nside effects began to surface. Doctors reported cases of nerve damage \nin early 1961, and by fall,\nthey’d unmasked a more horrible truth. Thalidomide, widely used by pregnant\nwomen, caused severe birth defects. Thousands of babies died in utero, and tens of thousands more \nwere born with extra appendages, shorter limbs, or no limbs at all. In November 1961, thalidomide \nwas pulled from the German market. Nonetheless, Merrell continued trying \nto get it approved in the US for several months before withdrawing \ntheir sixth and final application. While Kelsey wasn’t the only scientist \nto identify the risks of thalidomide, she sounded the alarm that kept it off the multi-billion-dollar \nAmerican drug market. As public awareness \nof the thalidomide tragedy grew, the quiet scientist \nbecame a media sensation. Headlines in newspapers \nand magazines heralded her heroism while a smiling President John F. Kennedy presented her an award \non the White House lawn. After the thalidomide scare, Congress passed laws that expanded \nthe FDA’s authority and toughened requirements \nfor new drug applications. Kelsey was tapped to head \nthe agency’s drug investigation branch. Working at the FDA in\ndifferent capacities into her 90s, Kelsey was able to witness the changes \nher actions helped inspire. Her visibility may have dimmed since,\nbut her legacy endures. Privileging facts over opinions, \nand patience over shortcuts, she made evidence-based medicine\nthe foundation of reforms that continue to protect people today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why did Frances Kelsey reject Merrell’s application?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It lacked concrete results"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It lacked well-designed studies"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It centered mainly on “testimonials”"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Thalidomide was ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A sedative used to treat insomnia, workplace stress, and nausea"}, {"label": "B", "text": "A stimulant used to increase dopamine"}, {"label": "C", "text": "A depressant used to calm nerves and relax muscles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An alcoholic beverage"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "In the 1960s, Frances Kelsey worked at the ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "CIA"}, {"label": "B", "text": "FDA"}, {"label": "C", "text": "EPA"}, {"label": "D", "text": "National Archives"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "In 1960, many experts believed that ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The placental barrier did not shield a fetus from harm"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The placenta grew outside the uterus"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The placental barrier did shield a fetus from harm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The placenta did not provide the fetus with oxygen, blood, and nutrients"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "After the thalidomide scare, Congress passed laws that ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Dismantled the FDA’s authority"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Expanded the FDA’s authority and toughened requirements for new drug applications"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Withdrew support for anti-nausea medication"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Pregnant women in the U.S. today ________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Are prescribed medications based on evaluations of a drug’s safety for a fetus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Can take thalidomide if they sign a consent form"}, {"label": "C", "text": "No longer experience morning sickness"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Are less aware of a drug’s risks than pregnant women in the 1950s"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Outside, it’s pitch black - just as \nit’s been for the last 12 days. This isn’t some post-apocalyptic scenario;\nit’s just another day of life on the moon. And with the European Space Agency’s idea to establish a functioning \n\"moon camp\" by the 2020s, that day may be\ncloser than we think. Of course, living on \nthe moon won’t be easy. The camp envisioned is not so much\na village as an inhabited research base similar to those \nin places like Antarctica. But there are far greater obstacles to\nliving on the moon than just cold weather. The biggest is cosmic radiation. Unlike the Earth, the moon has \nno atmosphere and no magnetic field. A person on its surface can receive \nover 400 times the maximum safe dosage of heavy ion radiation, enough to be fatal within ten hours, \neven in a spacesuit. The first step would likely involve robots and 3D printers constructing \ncovered habitats from lunar soil, or building shelters inside caves formed by lava tubes \nfrom the moon’s volcanic past. But what would the inhabitants live on? Supplies would need to be transported \nfrom Earth at first. Growing plants requires greenhouse soil \nand air rich in carbon dioxide, a gas that’s rare on the moon, but could be synthesized \nfrom recycled materials. A water treatment plant could be supplied \nby ice mined from the polar regions using a specialized drill that can bore \ntwo meters beneath the lunar surface. Friendly bacteria and viruses necessary \nto the human microbiome and immune system would also have to be imported \nor synthesized on site. And lunar inhabitants would have \nto exercise for hours a day to maintain bone and muscle mass. That’s because the moon’s gravity \nis just one-sixth that of the Earth, and the everyday strain of working \nagainst gravity is part of what keeps our bodies healthy. It might seem strange to go \nto all this trouble to build a base on a dead rock \nwe’ve already visited. But NASA’s Apollo missions only explored \nsmall portions of the moon. We’ve made many discoveries since then, such as ice near the poles and particles \nof solar wind gases that date back billions of years. They collectively show that the moon \nhas much more to teach us about the history of our solar system. A radio telescope on its far side could \nobserve the cosmos, shielded from the Earth’s electromagnetic\ninterference. And the lunar surface is rich in minerals,\nlike silicon, aluminum, and magnesium, creating great economic \npotential for mining. But the biggest benefit of the moon camp \nmay not lie on the moon but beyond it. With the nearest possibly habitable \nworld light-years away, and the International Space Station \nto be retired in about a decade, a moon base would be our first foothold towards becoming \nan interplanetary species. And proposals such as \nthe Deep Space Gateway envision launching future \nmissions from lunar orbit. The smaller gravitational pull \nwould require less fuel to overcome, allowing for larger ships and more cargo. Meanwhile, the base on the surface \ncould serve as a testing ground for future space operations, a refueling station, and a supply depot all in one. With Europe, Russia, China, and the US \nexpressing interest in the project, the moon camp may come to involve the space agencies of all major nations, \nas well as private companies. Within a few decades, the moon may be bustling \nwith mining operations, research stations, and tourist routes alongside a construction yard \nunder an orbiting space port.

Entering from the northwest, you pass through the city gates \nand the welcome center, where you’re given a map and a brochure. The map reveals that the town consists\nof 16 blocks, formed by five streets that \nrun west to east, intersecting five more \nthat run north to south. You’re standing on the\nnorthernmost street facing east, with the two blocks containing the gate \nand the welcome center behind you. The temple’s only entrance lies \nat the very southeast corner. It’s not a long walk, \nbut there’s a problem. As you learn from the brochure, Duonia imposes a unique tax \non all visitors, which must be paid when they arrive \nat their destination within the city. The tax begins at zero, increases by two silver \nfor every block you walk east, and doubles for every block \nyou walk south. However, a recent reform \nto make the tax fairer halves your total bill for\nevery block you walk north and subtracts two silver \nfor every block you walk west. Just passing through the gate \nand the welcome center means you already owe four silver. As a pilgrim you carry no money \nand have no way of earning any. What’s more, the rules \nof your pilgrimage forbid you from walking over any stretch of\nground more than once during your journey— though you can cross your own path. Can you figure out a way to reach \nthe temple without owing any tax or walking the same block twice \nin any direction? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You look at the map \nto consider your options. Walking towards the temple \nalways increases the tax, and walking away decreases it, so it seems like you can never reach it\nwithout owing silver. But what happens when you walk \naround a single block? If you start out owing four silver\nand go clockwise starting east, your tax bill becomes six, then 12, then 10, then five. If you looped again, you’d owe seven, 14, 12, and six. It seems that each clockwise loop leaves \nyou owing one extra silver. What about a counterclockwise loop then? Starting owing four again \nand going south first, your bill changes to eight, 10, five, and three. Looping again you’d owe six, eight, four, and two. Each counterclockwise loop actually earns \nyou one silver. That’s because any tax doubled, plus two, halved, and minus two, always ends up one smaller \nthan it started. The key here is that while the different \ntaxes for opposite directions may seem to balance each other out, the order in which they’re applied \nmakes a huge difference. You start off owing four silver, so four counterclockwise loops would \nget you down to zero. Unfortunately, it’s not that simple, \nsince you can’t walk the same block twice. But there’s another way\nto reduce your bill: walking one large counterclockwise loop\nthrough the city. From your starting position, \nwalk three blocks south. You need to leave the southernmost \nstreet clear for the final stretch, so continuing counterclockwise \nmeans going east. Walk two blocks to the eastern wall \nand you owe a whopping 36 silver. But now you can start reducing your bill. Three blocks north and one block west \ncuts it to 2.5. You can’t go west from here \n—that would leave you with no way out. So you go one block south, \nand the remaining three blocks west, leaving you with a debt \nof -1 silver. And since doubling a negative number \nstill gives you a negative number, walking the three blocks to the south wall\nmeans the city owes you eight. Fortunately, that’s exactly enough to get you through the final blocks \nto the temple. As you enter, you realize what \nyou’ve learned from your pilgrimage: sometimes an indirect route \nis the best way to reach your destination."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "If the pilgrim traveled east, east, south, south, south, south to reach the temple, what would his tax be?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100"}, {"label": "B", "text": "64"}, {"label": "C", "text": "128"}, {"label": "D", "text": "256"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If the pilgrim traveled east, east, south, south, south, south to reach the temple, what would his tax be?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "100"}, {"label": "B", "text": "64"}, {"label": "C", "text": "128"}, {"label": "D", "text": "256"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If the pilgrim went south, south, south, south, east, east, what would her tax be?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "64"}, {"label": "B", "text": "68"}, {"label": "C", "text": "128"}, {"label": "D", "text": "136"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If the pilgrim looped back to where she started, she would owe the same tax.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How many blocks does the town consist of?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "4"}, {"label": "B", "text": "8"}, {"label": "C", "text": "16"}, {"label": "D", "text": "20"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Duonia imposes a unique tax on _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All visitors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "All pets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "All residents"}, {"label": "D", "text": "No one"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Gradually, he lost the ability to walk, use his hands, move his face, and even swallow. But throughout it all,\nhe retained his incredible intellect, and in the more\nthan 50 years that followed, Hawking became one of history’s most \naccomplished and famous physicists. However, his condition went uncured and he passed away in 2018 \nat the age of 76. Decades after his diagnosis, ALS still ranks as one \nof the most complex, mysterious, and devastating \ndiseases to affect humankind. Also called motor neuron disease \nand Lou Gehrig’s Disease, ALS affects about two out of every\n100,000 people worldwide. When a person has ALS, their motor neurons, the cells responsible for all voluntary \nmuscle control in the body, lose function and die. No one knows exactly why\nor how these cells die and that’s part of what \nmakes ALS so hard to treat. In about 90% of cases, the disease arises suddenly, \nwith no apparent cause. The remaining 10% of cases are hereditary, where a mother or father with ALS passes \non a mutated gene to their child. The symptoms typically first appear \nafter age 40. But in some rare cases, like Hawking’s,\nALS starts earlier in life. Hawking’s case was also a medical marvel \nbecause of how long he lived with ALS. After diagnosis, most people with \nthe disease live between 2 to 5 years before ALS leads to respiratory problems \nthat usually cause death. What wasn’t unusual in Hawking’s case\nwas that his ability to learn, think, and perceive with his senses \nremained intact. Most people with ALS do not experience\nimpaired cognition. With so much at stake \nfor the 120,000 people who are diagnosed with ALS annually, curing the disease has become one of \nour most important scientific and medical challenges. Despite the many unknowns, we do have some insight into how ALS \nimpacts the neuromuscular system. ALS affects two types of nerve cells \ncalled the upper and lower motor neurons. In a healthy body, \nthe upper motor neurons, which sit in the brain’s cortex, transmit messages\nfrom the brain to the lower motor neurons, situated in the spinal cord. Those neurons then transmit \nthe message into muscle fibers, which contract or relax in response, resulting in motion. Every voluntary move we make occurs because of messages transmitted \nalong this pathway. But when motor neurons degenerate in ALS, their ability to transfer \nmessages is disrupted, and that vital signaling system \nis thrown into chaos. Without their regular cues, \nthe muscles waste away. Precisely what makes \nthe motor neurons degenerate is the prevailing \nmystery of ALS. In hereditary cases, parents pass genetic \nmutations on to their children. Even then, ALS involves multiple genes with multiple possible impacts \non motor neurons, making the precise triggers\nhard to pinpoint. When ALS arises sporadically,\nthe list of possible causes grows: toxins, viruses, lifestyle, or other environmental factors \nmay all play roles. And because there are \nso many elements involved, there’s currently no single test that\ncan determine whether someone has ALS. Nevertheless, our hypotheses \non the causes are developing. One prevailing idea is that certain\nproteins inside the motor neurons aren’t folding correctly, and are instead forming clumps. The misfolded proteins and clumps \nmay spread from cell to cell. This could be clogging up normal\ncellular processes, like energy and protein production, \nwhich keep cells alive. We’ve also learned that along with \nmotor neurons and muscle fibers, ALS could involve other\ncell types. ALS patients typically have inflammation \nin their brains and spinal cords. Defective immune cells may also play \na role in killing motor neurons. And ALS seems to change the\nbehavior of specific cells that provide support for neurons. These factors highlight \nthe disease’s complexity, but they may also give us a fuller\nunderstanding of how it works, opening up new avenues for treatment. And while that may be gradual,\nwe’re making progress all the time. We’re currently developing new drugs, new stem cell therapies \nto repair damaged cells, and new gene therapies \nto slow the advancement of the disease. With our growing arsenal of knowledge, we look forward to discoveries\nthat can change the future for people living with ALS."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is also called _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Multiple sclerosis"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Motor neuron disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lou Gehrig’s disease"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Motor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig's disease"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "About how many people are diagnosed with ALS worldwide per year?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "About 30,000"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About 100,000"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About 120,000"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About 1,000,000"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What percentage of ALS is not hereditary?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "About 10%"}, {"label": "B", "text": "About 40%"}, {"label": "C", "text": "About 50%"}, {"label": "D", "text": "About 90%"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "After diagnosis, most people with ALS live for _______ years.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1-2 years"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2-5 years"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5-10 years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "50 years"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Most people with ALS _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lose the ability to voluntarily move their muscles"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Are cognitively impaired"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lose the ability to see"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lose the ability to hear"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

It was only 10 days away from Pluto, \nafter flying for 9.5 years, when it suddenly dropped out of contact. But let’s back up a little. As of 1989, mankind had successfully sent craft \nto every known planet in the solar system except one—Pluto. You may have heard that astronomers \ndon’t consider Pluto or its brethren to be planets. However, most planetary \nscientists still do, which is why we're using \nthat terminology here. There’s a limited amount \nwe can learn about Pluto from Earth because it’s so far from us. Pluto, however, is a scientific goldmine. It’s located in a region \ncalled the Kuiper Belt, home to many small planets, hundreds of thousands \nof ancient icy objects, and trillions of comets. This mysterious region holds clues \nto the formation of our solar system, and it was long, \ntantalizingly beyond our reach. Until New Horizons. Its objectives: explore Pluto, collect as much scientific \ndata as possible, transmit it back to Earth, then explore farther out \nin the Kuiper Belt. To achieve this, the New Horizons team \noutfitted their craft with seven state-of-the-art \nscientific instruments. Those included Ralph, a set of cameras powerful enough to capture features the size \nof city blocks in Manhattan from tens of thousands of kilometers away. And REX, designed to use radio waves to measure Pluto’s atmospheric pressure \nand temperature. All of the onboard equipment had to be\nbuilt to be both reliable and lightweight because New Horizons had an\nadditional challenge; it had to reach its target \nas fast as possible. Why? Around 2020, Pluto will reach \na point in its orbit where its atmosphere could freeze. And due to the tilt of its axis, more and more of Pluto’s surface \nis shrouded in darkness every year. Pluto completes a full orbit\nonce every 248 Earth years, so it would be a long wait \nfor the next prime opportunity to visit. To see how New Horizons \ngot to Pluto in time, let’s jump to its launch. Its three rocket stages accelerated \nNew Horizons to such great speeds that it crossed the 400,000 kilometers \nto the moon in just nine hours. About a year later, \nthe craft reached Jupiter and got what’s called a gravity assist. That’s where it flies close enough\nto the gas giant to receive a gravitational\nslingshot effect. New Horizons was then flying \nat around 50,000 kilometers per hour, as it would for the next eight years \nto cross the remaining gulf to Pluto. Going at such an astonishing speed meant that slowing down \nto get into orbit or land would’ve been impossible. That’s why New Horizons was on \na flyby mission, where it would get just one chance to\nscream by Pluto and make its observations. The flyby would have \nto be fully automated, since at that distance, any signals \nto guide it from Earth would take 4.5 hours to reach it. So the team loaded the ship’s computer \nwith a series of thousands of commands, called the core load, that would begin to execute \nwhen the craft was 6.5 days from Pluto. But when New Horizons \nwas just ten days out, disaster almost struck. Ground control lost contact \nwith the spacecraft. After two nerve-wracking hours,\nNew Horizons came back online, but mission control discovered \nthat its main computer had rebooted, losing the entire core load \nand other critical data. Without that, it would soon \nwhizz by Pluto with virtually nothing \nto show for the mission. Alice Bowman, \nthe mission’s Operations Manager, led a team for 72 sleepless hours \nto get the instructions loaded back into New Horizons in time. Without room for a single error,\nshe and her team pulled it off, and New Horizons began taking \nand broadcasting breathtaking images. Those observations have revealed \na delightfully varied world, with ground fogs, high altitude hazes, possible clouds, canyons, towering mountains, faults, craters, polar caps, glaciers, apparent dune fields, suspected ice volcanoes, evidence for past flowing liquids, and more. One of the most exciting discoveries is the 1000-kilometer-wide\nSputnik Planitia glacier. Sputnik Planitia is mainly composed \nof slowly churning frozen nitrogen, and we’ve never seen anything \nlike it in our solar system. The exploration of Pluto \nwas a great success, but New Horizons isn’t done yet. On January 1, 2019, it’ll break its own record for \nfurthest explored object when it visits a Kuiper Belt Object \ncalled 2014 MU69, which is orbiting the sun another billion\nkilometers farther away than Pluto.

{"page": 88, "lesson": 21, "title": "Why do we sweat? - John Murnan", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-we-sweat-john-murnan", "transcript": {"en": "The finish line's in sight\nand you put on an extra burst of speed. As your legs pick up the pace,\nyour breathing gets deeper, your heart pounds faster, and sweat pours over your skin. How does this substance\nsuddenly materialize and what exactly is its purpose? There are a number of scenarios\nthat can make us sweat: eating spicy foods, nervousness, and when we're sick. But exercise is probably the most familiar\nand common. In that case, sweating happens \nas a response to movement triggered deep inside your cells. As you increase your pace,\nyour muscles work harder, increasing their demand for energy. A process called cellular respiration consumes glucose \nand oxygen to form ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Much of this process takes place\nin structures called mitochondria. The more you move, the harder mitochondria work\nto supply your body with energy. All this work comes at a cost, though. As the cells break down the ATP,\nthey release heat. The heat stimulates temperature sensors\nthroughout your body. Those receptors detect the excess heat\nbeing produced by your muscle cells and communicate that information\nto the hypothalamus, which regulates body temperature. The hypothalamus responds by sending signals out through \nthe sympathetic nervous system to the sweat glands in your skin. These are distributed all over the body with especially high concentrations\non the palms of your hands, the soles of your feet, and on your head. When a sweat gland first receives\nthe signal, the fluid surrounding the cells\nin its coiled base contains high amounts \nof sodium and chloride. The cells pump these ions\ninto a hollow tube that runs through the sweat gland. Then, because it's saltier inside\nthe tube than outside, water moves into the tube by osmosis. As what's called the primary secretion\nbuilds up in the bottom of the tube, water pressure pushes it up\ninto the long straight part of the duct. Before it seeps onto the skin, cells lining the tube will reclaim\nas much salt as possible so the process can continue. The water in sweat absorbs \nyour body's heat energy and then evaporates off of you\nwhen it reaches the surface, which in turn lowers your temperature. This process, \nknown as evaporative cooling, was an important adaptation \nfor our ancestors. This cooling effect isn't only helpful\nduring exercise. We sweat in many other scenarios, too. Eating particularly spicy food makes some\npeople sweat profusely from their faces. That happens because spices trigger\nthe same neural response in the brain that activates temperature receptors,\nwhich usually respond to increased heat. Sweating is also part of \nthe fight or flight response stimulated by stressful scenarios,\nlike asking someone on a date or interviewing for a job. This happens because adrenaline\nstimulates muscle activity and causes blood vessels to widen, two responses that increase heat\nand trigger the sweating response. And sweating also occurs \nwhen we get sick. When we're feverish,\nwe sweat because infections stimulate the hypothalamus \nto increase muscle activity, which in turn releases \nmore energy as heat. That increases your overall temperature, a protective mechanism that makes your\nbody less habitable for infectious agents. Like with running, sweating helps\nyour body vent that heat. When the fever's over \nor you've won your race, your temperature receptors \nsense the decrease in heat and the hypothalamus brings \nyour sweating response to an end. In some cases, like after a run, the hypothalamus also signals\nto your body that you need to replenish the water\nthat you've oozed out. So, when you're pushing yourself\nto reach that next goal, you can think of sweat as your body's\nvery own calibrator, enabling you to go that extra mile."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which of the following scenarios will you not sweat?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Exercise"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Eating spicy food"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Overhydrating"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nervousness"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What is the source of your body’s temperature?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Digestion of food"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The breakdown of ATP to do work in cells"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Friction when your muscle fibers move against each other"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The burning of fat for energy"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is the part of the brain that is responsible for regulating your temperature?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Frontal lobe"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Cerebellum"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Parietal lobe"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hypothalamus"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What is the immediate source of water for the sweat that the sweat gland produces?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The fluid surrounding the cells of the gland"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The fluid inside the cells of the gland"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The plasma from the blood"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The fluid from the kidneys"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Besides exercise, what other activity might trigger the sweat response?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Drinking too much water"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Getting a brain freeze from eating ice cream"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Eating spicy food"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Watching a romantic comedy"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

This is a familiar scene \nin many sci-fi films, but could humans ever actually \nhibernate in real life? Researchers interested in this question \nturn to the animal kingdom, where hibernation is commonplace, occurring in over 200 species \nthat we know of. Take the Arctic ground squirrel. Native to the North American tundra \nand northern Russia, this animal burrows \nbeneath the permafrost and slips into a state \nof suspended animation, its body temperature plummeting \nto a frigid -2.9 degrees Celsius. Others, like the female black bear, \ncan multitask, giving birth and lactating while they’re\nhibernating through the winter. The fat-tailed dwarf lemur prepares \nfor its long dormancy by gorging on food and storing the \nmajority of its fat reserves in its tail, doubling its body weight. After hibernation, it emerges looking \nas svelte as ever. So why do these animals \ngo to such extremes? Hibernation is a necessity, a survival tactic for making it \nthrough the harsh winter months when dwindling food \nand water reserves threaten survival. For many years, experts believed \nhibernation happened only in arctic and temperate environments. But more recently, they’ve discovered \nanimals hibernating even in arid deserts \nand tropical rainforests. As hibernation kicks in, animals’ heartbeats usually slow to\nabout 1 to 3% of their original speed, like the dwarf lemur’s, which drops from its usual \nroughly 180 beats per minute to just around four. Breathing also declines dramatically to just one breath every 10 to 21 minutes \nin the lemur’s case. And black bears, like most hibernators, don’t urinate \nor defecate the entire hibernation season. Hibernating animals appear to stay alive by having just enough blood\nand oxygen moving around their bodies. And scans of hibernating animals \nreveal that their brain activity has just about flat-lined. But hibernation isn’t a long winter’s nap. As far as researchers know, in lemurs and\nground squirrels anyway, the animals aren’t even \nsleeping for most of it. Hibernation is actually made up of regular\nbouts of reduced metabolic rate and body temperature known as torpor. Animals can be in torpor \nfor a few days to five weeks, after which they resume normal \nmetabolic rate and body temperature for about 24 hours, before going back into torpor again. The phenomenon is known \nas an interbout arousal, and why it occurs is still a mystery. The behaviors inherent in hibernation, like going five weeks without sleep, or dropping to \nnear-freezing body temperatures would be potentially fatal \nto non-hibernating species like us. To find out how hibernators \nare able to do this, researchers turned their attention\nto those animal’s genomes. So far, they’ve discovered that\nhibernation is controlled by genes that turn off and on in\nunique patterns throughout the year, fine-tuning the hibernator’s physiology \nand behavior. For example, ground squirrel, bear \nand dwarf lemur studies have revealed that these\nanimals are able to turn on the genes that control fat metabolism precisely when they need to use \ntheir fat stores as fuel to survive \nlong periods of fasting. And the genes in question \nare present in all mammals, which means that researchers could\nstudy hibernating mammals to see how their unique control \nof physiology might help humans. Understanding how hibernators deal \nwith reduced blood flow could lead to better treatments \nfor protecting the brain during a stroke. Figuring out how these animals avoid\nmuscle deterioration might improve the lives \nof bedridden patients. And studying how hibernating animals \ncontrol their weight with ease could illuminate the relationship between\nmetabolism and weight gain in humans. And yes, more research in this area might someday make \nhuman hibernation a real possibility. Imagine our surprise if the key to\nintergalactic travel turns out to be ground squirrels, \nblack bears, and dwarf lemurs."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How many species are known to hibernate?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "1"}, {"label": "B", "text": "30"}, {"label": "C", "text": "100"}, {"label": "D", "text": "200"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Where can hibernators be found?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Arctic areas"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Arid deserts"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tropical rainforests"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A dwarf lemur’s normal heart rate is 180 beats per minute.

{"page": 88, "lesson": 23, "title": "How do we study living brains? - John Borghi and Elizabeth Waters", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-do-we-study-living-brains-john-borghi-and-elizabeth-waters", "transcript": {"en": "As far as we know, there’s only one thing in our solar system\nsophisticated enough to study itself: the human brain. But this self-investigation \nis incredibly challenging; a living brain is shielded \nby a thick skull, swaddled in layers of protective tissue, and made up of billions of tiny,\nconnected cells. That’s why it’s so difficult to isolate, \nobserve, and understand diseases like Alzheimer’s. So how do we study living brains \nwithout harming their owners? We can use a trio of techniques \ncalled EEG, fMRI, and PET. Each measures something different \nand has its own strengths and weaknesses, and we’ll look at each in turn. First is EEG, or electroencephalography, which measures electrical \nactivity in your brain. As brain cells communicate, \nthey produce waves of electricity. Electrodes placed on the skull pick\nup these waves, and differences in the signals detected \nbetween electrodes provide information \nabout what’s happening. This technique was invented \nalmost 100 years ago, and it’s still used to diagnose conditions\nlike epilepsy and sleep disorders. It’s also used to investigate what areas \nof the brain are active during learning or paying attention. EEG is non-invasive, relatively inexpensive, and fast: it can measure changes that occur \nin just milliseconds. Unfortunately, it’s hard to determine exactly where any particular \npattern originates. Electrical signals are generated \nconstantly all over the brain and they interact with each other to\nproduce complex patterns. Using more electrodes or sophisticated \ndata-processing algorithms can help. But in the end, while EEG can tell you \nprecisely when certain activity occurs, it can’t tell you precisely where. To do that, you’d need another technique, such as functional magnetic \nresonance imaging, or fMRI. fMRI measures how quickly oxygen \nis consumed by brain cells. Active areas of the brain use\noxygen more quickly. So watching an fMRI scan while a person\ncompletes cognitive or behavioral tasks can provide information about which \nregions of the brain might be involved. That allows us to study everything\nfrom how we see faces to how we understand what we’re feeling. fMRI can pinpoint differences in brain\nactivity to within a few millimeters, but it’s thousands \nof times slower than EEG. Using the two techniques together can help show when,\nand where, neural activity is occurring. The third, even more precise, technique\nis called positron emission tomography and it measures radioactive elements \nintroduced into the brain. That sounds much scarier \nthan it actually is; PET scans, like fMRI and EEG, \nare completely safe. During a PET scan, a small amount\nof radioactive material called a tracer is injected into the bloodstream, and doctors monitor its\ncirculation through the brain. By modifying the tracer\nto bind to specific molecules, researchers can use PET to study \nthe complex chemistry in our brains. It’s useful for studying \nhow drugs affect the brain and detecting diseases like Alzheimer’s. But this technique has \nthe lowest time resolution of all because it takes minutes for the tracer \nto circulate and changes to show up. These techniques collectively \nhelp doctors and scientists connect what happens in the\nbrain with our behavior. But they’re also limited \nby how much we still don't know. For example, let's say researchers are\ninterested in studying how memory works. After asking 50 participants to memorize \na series of images while in MRI scanners, the researchers might analyze the results and discover a number \nof active brain regions. Making a link between memory \nand specific parts of the brain is an important step forward. But future research would be necessary to better understand \nwhat’s happening in each region, how they work together, and whether the activity is because \nof their involvement in memory or another process \noccurring simultaneously. More advanced imaging \nand analysis technology might one day provide \nmore accurate results and even distinguish the activity of individual neurons. Until then, our brains will\nkeep measuring, analyzing, and innovating in pursuit of that quest to understand one of the most remarkable things \nwe’ve ever encountered."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Why is it so difficult to study the living brain?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The brain is protected by layers of bone and tissue"}, {"label": "B", "text": "We don’t want to damage the brain by using invasive techniques"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The brain is made up of billions of interconnected cells"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which imaging technology directly measures brain activity?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "EEG"}, {"label": "B", "text": "PET"}, {"label": "C", "text": "fMRI"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Of the three techniques mentioned in the video, which one provides the most precise information about when brain activity occurs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "PET"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fMRI"}, {"label": "C", "text": "EEG"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Of the three techniques mentioned in the video, which one can provide the most precise information about WHERE brain activity occurs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "EEG"}, {"label": "B", "text": "fMRI"}, {"label": "C", "text": "PET"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "If a researcher observes activity in a specific part of the brain while a person does a specific task (such as remembering a face), what can they conclude?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "There is some link between activity in that specific part of the brain and that specific task"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Any activity observed in that specific part of the brain means a person is doing that specific task"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That specific part of the brain works by itself to help a person do that specific task"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
