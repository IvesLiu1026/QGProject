This type of bodily damage,\ncaused by rapid changes in pressure, is called barotrauma. Under the sea, pressure increases\nby 14.7 pounds per square inch for every 33 foot increase in depth. So, take the yelloweye rockfish, which can live as deep as 1800 feet, where there's over 800 pounds of pressure\non every square inch. That's equivalent to the weight of a\npolar bear balancing on a quarter. Now, Boyle's gas law states that the volume of a gas\nis inversely related to pressure. So, any air-filled spaces,\nlike a rockfish's swim bladder, or human lungs, will compress as they descend deeper and expand as they ascend. After a fish bites a fisherman's hook\nand is quickly reeled up to the surface, the air in its swim bladder \nbegins to expand. Its rapid expansion actually forces\nthe fish's stomach out of its mouth, while the increased internal pressure\npushes its eyes out of their sockets, a condition called exophthalmia. Sometimes rockfish eyes will even have\na crystallized appearance from corneal emphysemas, little gas bubbles \nthat build up inside the cornea. Thankfully, a scuba diver doesn't have\na closed swim bladder to worry about. A diver can regulate pressure in her lungs\nby breathing out as she ascends, but must be wary of other laws of physics\nthat are at play under the sea. Henry's law states that the amount \nof a gas that dissolves in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure. The air a diver breathes is 78% nitrogen. At a higher pressure under the sea, the nitrogen from the air in a scuba tank diffuses into a diver's tissues in greater\nconcentrations than it would on land. If the diver ascends too quickly, this built up nitrogen \ncan come out of solution and form microbubbles in her tissues,\nblood and joints, causing decompression sickness,\naka the bends. This is similar to the fizz \nof carbon dioxide coming out of your soda. Gas comes out of solution \nwhen the pressure's released. But for a diver, the bubbles\ncause severe pain and sometimes even death. Divers avoid falling victim to the bends\nby rising slowly and taking breaks along the way,\ncalled decompression stops, so the gas has time to diffuse \nback out of their tissues and to be released through their breath. Just as a diver needs decompression, for a fish to recover, \nit needs recompression, which can be accomplished \nby putting it back in the sea. But that doesn't mean that fish\nshould just be tossed overboard. An inflated body will float and get scooped up by a hungry sea lion\nor pecked at by seagulls. There's a common myth that piercing its stomach \nwith a needle will let air escape, allowing the fish to swim \nback down on its own. But that is one balloon\nthat shouldn't be popped. To return a fish properly to its habitat, fisherman can use \na descending device instead to lower it on a fishing line\nand release it at the right depth. As it heads home and recompression\nreduces gas volume, its eyes can return \nto their sockets and heal, and its stomach can move back into place. This fish will live to see another day, once more free to swim, eat, reproduce\nand replenish the population."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Under the sea pressure increases by 14.7 pounds per square inch for every _____ foot increase in depth.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "63"}, {"label": "B", "text": "800"}, {"label": "C", "text": "33"}, {"label": "D", "text": "14"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does Boyle's gas law state?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The volume of a gas is inversely related to its pressure"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The amount of a gas that dissolves in a liquid is proportional to its partial temperature"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The volume of a gas is proportional to its temperature"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The amount of a gas that dissolves in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is the name of the air-filled organ that has the most potential to cause bodily harm due to rapid expansion when a rockfish is reeled to the surface?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Esophagus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stomach"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Swimbladder"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lungs"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What causes 'the bends' by forming microbubbles in tissues, blood and joints?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nitrogen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hydrogen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Niobium"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "How can a diver avoid getting decompression sickness?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rising slowly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Taking decompression stops"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Releasing the nitrogen through their breath"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

You've just won the lottery, only the prize isn't cash\nor a luxury cruise. It's a position in your country's\nnational legislature. And you aren't the only lucky winner. All of your fellow lawmakers \nwere chosen in the same way. This might strike you as a strange\nway to run a government, let alone a democracy. Elections are the epitome \nof democracy, right? Well, the ancient Athenians\nwho coined the word had another view. In fact, elections only played\na small role in Athenian democracy, with most offices filled by random lottery\nfrom a pool of citizen volunteers. Unlike the representative \ndemocracies common today, where voters elect leaders to make laws\nand decisions on their behalf, 5th Century BC Athens was \na direct democracy that encouraged wide participation through the principle of ho boulomenos,\nor anyone who wishes. This meant that any of its approximately\n30,000 eligible citizens could attend the ecclesia, a general assembly meeting\nseveral times a month. In principle, any of the 6,000 or so\nwho showed up at each session had the right to address \ntheir fellow citizens, propose a law, or bring a public lawsuit. Of course, a crowd of 6,000 people\ntrying to speak at the same time would not have made \nfor effective government. So the Athenian system also relied on\na 500 member governing council called the Boule, to set the agenda\nand evaluate proposals, in addition to hundreds of jurors\nand magistrates to handle legal matters. Rather than being elected or appointed, the people in these positions\nwere chosen by lot. This process of randomized selection\nis know as sortition. The only positions filled by elections were those recognized \nas requiring expertise, such as generals. But these were considered aristocratic,\nmeaning rule by the best, as opposed to democracies,\nrule by the many. How did this system come to be? Well, democracy arose in Athens after long\nperiods of social and political tension marked by conflict among nobles. Powers once restricted to elites, such as speaking in the assembly\nand having their votes counted, were expanded to ordinary citizens. And the ability of ordinary citizens\nto perform these tasks adequately became a central feature\nof the democratice ideology of Athens. Rather than a privilege, civic participation \nwas the duty of all citizens, with sortition and strict term limits\npreventing governing classes or political parties from forming. By 21st century standards, Athenian rule by the many\nexcluded an awful lot of people. Women, slaves and foreigners\nwere denied full citizenship, and when we filter out \nthose too young to serve, the pool of eligible Athenians drops\nto only 10-20% of the overall population. Some ancient philosophers, \nincluding Plato, disparaged this form of democracy\nas being anarchic and run by fools. But today the word \nhas such positive associations, that vastly different regimes \nclaim to embody it. At the same time, some share Plato's\nskepticism about the wisdom of crowds. Many modern democracies \nreconcile this conflict by having citizens elect \nthose they consider qualified to legislate on their behalf. But this poses its own problems, including the influence of wealth, and the emergence \nof professional politicians with different interests \nthan their constituents. Could reviving election by lottery\nlead to more effective government through a more diverse and representative\ngroup of legislatures? Or does modern political office,\nlike Athenian military command, require specialized knowledge and skills? You probably shouldn't hold your breath to win a spot \nin your country's government. But depending on where you live, you may still be selected \nto participate in a jury, a citizens' assembly, or a deliberative poll, all examples of how the democratic\nprinciple behind sortition still survives today."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Who could attend the Athenian assembly, or ekklesia?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All members of the community"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Only elected representatives"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only citizens chosen by lot"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Any adult male citizen who wished"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "How was the Council of 500, or boule, selected?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By election"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By lottery"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anyone who wished could attend"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Members were appointed"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Which office was filled by election?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Member of the assembly"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Member of the jury"}, {"label": "C", "text": "General"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Member of the Council of 500"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who was eligible to hold political office?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Women"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Slaves"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Adult men"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Resident aliens (foreigners)"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "What does \"democracy\" mean?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Rule by the few"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Rule by children"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Rule by the best"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Rule by the many"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

It covers over 70% of the Earth, cycling from the oceans and rivers\nto the clouds and back again. It even makes up about 60% of our bodies. With all this water around and inside us, it's easy to take \nits presence for granted. But in the rest of the solar system,\nliquid water is almost impossible to find. So how did our planet end\nup with so much of this substance and where did it come from? As you probably know, a water molecule consists \nof two basic parts. Hydrogen, the simplest of all elements, has been around since close \nto the beginning of our universe. Oxygen entered the scene \nseveral hundred million years later after stars began to form. The massive pressure at the center\nof these fiery infernos was so great that hydrogen atoms \nfused together to form helium. Helium, in turn, fused \nto form heavier elements, like beryllium, carbon, and oxygen\nin a process known as nucleosynthesis. When stars eventually collapsed\nand exploded into supernovas, these new elements \nwere spread across the universe and combined into new compounds,\nlike the now familiar H2O. These water molecules \nwere present in the dusty cloud that formed our solar system and more collided with our planet\nafter its formation. But there's a big question \nthat we don't have the answer to: how much water arrived on Earth, and when? If, as one theory goes, relatively small amounts of water were\npresent on Earth when the rock formed, the high temperatures \nand lack of any surrounding atmosphere would have caused it \nto evaporate back into space. Water would have been unable \nto remain on the planet until hundreds of millions of years later when our first atmosphere formed\nthrough a process called outgassing. This occurred when \nmolten rock in the Earth's core released volcanic gasses to the surface, creating a layer \nthat could then trap escaping water. So how then did water \nget back to the planet? Scientists have long suspected that much of it was brought\nby ice-bearing comets, or more likely asteroids that bombarded\nthe Earth over millions of years. Recent research \nhas challenged this theory. In examining carbonaceous \nchondrite meterorites that formed shorty after the birth\nof our solar system, scientists have found \nthat not only did they contain water, but their mineral chemical composition\nmatched rocks on Earth and samples from an asteroid that \nformed at the same time as our planet. This suggests that the Earth \nmay have accumulated a substantial amount of water\nearly on that was able to stay put, despite the lack of an atmosphere, though asteroids may \nhave brought more over the eons. If this turns out to be true, life may have formed much earlier\nthan previously thought. So we do not yet definitively know\nwhether the water on Earth came from its initial formation, later impacts, or some combination of the two. Regardless, the water that runs from our\nshowers, drinking fountains, and faucets is something that didn’t just come\nfrom a nearby lake or river, but first underwent a cosmic \nand chaotic journey to get here."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the oldest and most abundant of the elements?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Beryllium"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Iron"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Oxygen"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Hydrogen"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Which piece of evidence does not support the theory that water came much earlier in Earth's history than once suspected?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Examination of fossil remains"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Examination of carbonaceous chondrites"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Examination of rocks on earth"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Examination of asteroids"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What is not a likely scenario of how water was initially delivered to Earth?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Meteors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ice bearing comets"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Outgassing"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Asteroids"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which two reasons were thought to have rid Earth of its early water?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Lack of an atmosphere"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Collisions with space debris"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lack of gravity"}, {"label": "D", "text": "High surface temperatures"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The process that originally created the element Oxygen is known as _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Outgassing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Nucleosynthesis"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Asteroid impact"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Photosynthesis"}, {"label": "E", "text": "Outgassing"}, {"label": "F", "text": "Nucleosynthesis"}, {"label": "G", "text": "Asteroid impact"}, {"label": "H", "text": "Photosynthesis"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 96, "lesson": 4, "title": "Can robots be creative? - Gil Weinberg", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/can-robots-be-creative-gil-weinberg", "transcript": {"en": "How does this music make you feel? Do you find it beautiful? Is it creative? Now, would you change your answers if you learned \nthe composer was this robot? Believe it or not, people have been grappling with\nthe question of artificial creativity, alongside the question \nof artifcial intelligence, for over 170 years. In 1843, Lady Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician considered\nthe world's first computer programmer, wrote that a machine could not have\nhuman-like intelligence as long as it only did what humans\nintentionally programmed it to do. According to Lovelace, a machine must be able \nto create original ideas if it is to be considered intelligent. The Lovelace Test, formalized in 2001,\nproposes a way of scrutinizing this idea. A machine can pass this test\nif it can produce an outcome that its designers cannot explain \nbased on their original code. The Lovelace Test is, by design,\nmore of a thought experiment than an objective scientific test. But it's a place to start. At first glance, the idea of a machine creating \nhigh quality, original music in this way might seem impossible. We could come up with an extremely\ncomplex algorithm using random number generators,\nchaotic functions, and fuzzy logic to generate a sequence of musical notes in a way that would be \nimpossible to track. But although this would yield countless\noriginal melodies never heard before, only a tiny fraction of them\nwould be worth listening to. With the computer having no way\nto distinguish between those which\nwe would consider beautiful and those which we won't. But what if we took a step back and tried to model a natural process\nthat allows creativity to form? We happen to know of at least\none such process that has lead to original, valuable,\nand even beautiful outcomes: the process of evolution. And evolutionary algorithms, or genetic algorithms\nthat mimic biological evolution, are one promising approach to making machines generate original\nand valuable artistic outcomes. So how can evolution make \na machine musically creative? Well, instead of organisms, we can start with an initial\npopulation of musical phrases, and a basic algorithm that mimics reproduction \nand random mutations by switching some parts, combining others, and replacing random notes. Now that we have \na new generation of phrases, we can apply selection using \nan operation called a fitness function. Just as biological fitness is determined\nby external environmental pressures, our fitness function can be determined\nby an external melody chosen by human musicians, or music fans, to represent the ultimate \nbeautiful melody. The algorithm can then compare\nbetween our musical phrases and that beautiful melody, and select only the phrases\nthat are most similar to it. Once the least similar sequences\nare weeded out, the algorithm can reapply mutation\nand recombination to what's left, select the most similar, or fitted ones,\nagain from the new generation, and repeat for many generations. The process that got us there has so much\nrandomness and complexity built in that the result might \npass the Lovelace Test. More importantly, thanks to the presence \nof human aesthetic in the process, we'll theoretically generate melodies\nwe would consider beautiful. But does this satisfy our intuition\nfor what is truly creative? Is it enough to make something\noriginal and beautiful, or does creativity require intention\nand awareness of what is being created? Perhaps the creativity in this case\nis really coming from the programmers, even if they don't understand the process. What is human creativity, anyways? Is it something more than a system\nof interconnected neurons developed by biological \nalgorithmic processes and the random experiences \nthat shape our lives? Order and chaos,\nmachine and human. These are the dynamos at the heart\nof machine creativity initiatives that are currently making music, \nsculptures, paintings, poetry and more. The jury may still be out as to whether it's fair to call \nthese acts of creation creative.

Big topics you might tackle figuratively explaining existence as a journey \ndown a road or across an ocean, a climb, a war, a book, a thread, a game,\na window of opportunity, or an all-too-short-lived \nflicker of flame. 2,400 years ago, one of history's famous thinkers said\nlife is like being chained up in a cave, forced to watch shadows \nflitting across a stone wall. Pretty cheery, right? That's actually what Plato suggested\nin his Allegory of the Cave, found in Book VII of \"The Republic,\" in which the Greek philosopher\nenvisioned the ideal society by examining concepts \nlike justice, truth and beauty. In the allegory, a group of prisoners\nhave been confined in a cavern since birth, with no knowledge of the outside world. They are chained, facing a wall,\nunable to turn their heads, while a fire behind them\ngives off a faint light. Occasionally, people pass by the fire, carrying figures of animals and other objects\nthat cast shadows on the wall. The prisoners name \nand classify these illusions, believing they're perceiving\nactual entities. Suddenly, one prisoner is freed\nand brought outside for the first time. The sunlight hurts his eyes and he finds\nthe new environment disorienting. When told that the things \naround him are real,` while the shadows were mere reflections,\nhe cannot believe it. The shadows appeared much clearer to him. But gradually, his eyes adjust until he can look \nat reflections in the water, at objects directly, and finally at the Sun, whose light is the ultimate source\nof everything he has seen. The prisoner returns to the cave\nto share his discovery, but he is no longer used to the darkness, and has a hard time \nseeing the shadows on the wall. The other prisoners think the journey\nhas made him stupid and blind, and violently resist \nany attempts to free them. Plato introduces this passage\nas an analogy of what it's like to be a philosopher\ntrying to educate the public. Most people are not just comfortable\nin their ignorance but hostile to anyone who points it out. In fact, the real life Socrates\nwas sentenced to death by the Athenian government \nfor disrupting the social order, and his student Plato \nspends much of \"The Republic\" disparaging Athenian democracy, while promoting rule by philosopher kings. With the cave parable, Plato may be arguing that the masses\nare too stubborn and ignorant to govern themselves. But the allegory has captured\nimaginations for 2,400 years because it can be read in far more ways. Importantly, the allegory is connected\nto the theory of forms, developed in Plato's other dialogues, which holds that \nlike the shadows on the wall, things in the physical world are flawed\nreflections of ideal forms, such as roundness, or beauty. In this way, the cave leads to many\nfundamental questions, including the origin of knowledge, the problem of representation, and the nature of reality itself. For theologians, the ideal forms\nexist in the mind of a creator. For philosophers of language\nviewing the forms as linguistic concepts, the theory illustrates the problem\nof grouping concrete things under abstract terms. And others still wonder whether\nwe can really know that the things outside the cave\nare any more real than the shadows. As we go about our lives, can we be confident \nin what we think we know? Perhaps one day, a glimmer of light may punch a hole\nin your most basic assumptions. Will you break free to struggle\ntowards the light, even if it costs you \nyour friends and family, or stick with comfortable\nand familiar illusions? Truth or habit? Light or shadow?

In over 70 million HIV cases, \nthat was a first and, so far, a last. We don't yet understand exactly\nhow he was cured. We can cure people of various diseases,\nsuch as malaria and hepatitis C, so why can't we cure HIV? Well, first let's examine \nhow HIV infects people and progresses into AIDS. HIV spreads through \nexchanges of bodily fluids. Unprotected sex and contaminated needles\nare the leading cause of transmission. It, fortunately, cannot spread\nthrough air, water, or casual contact. Individuals of any age,\nsexual orientation, gender and race can contract HIV. Once inside the body, HIV infects cells\nthat are part of the immune system. It particularly targets helper T cells, which help defend the body against \nbacterial and fungal infections. HIV is a retrovirus, which means it can write its genetic code\ninto the genome of infected cells, co-opting them into making \nmore copies of itself. During the first stage of HIV infection, the virus replicates \nwithin helper T cells, destroying many of them in the process. During this stage, patients often \nexperience flu-like symptoms, but are typically \nnot yet in mortal danger. However, for a period ranging \nfrom a few months to several years, during which time the patient may look\nand feel completely healthy, the virus continues to replicate\nand destroy T cells. When T cell counts drop too low, patients are in serious danger\nof contracting deadly infections that healthy immune systems\ncan normally handle. This stage of HIV infection\nis known as AIDS. The good news is there are drugs\nthat are highly effective at managing levels of HIV and preventing T cell counts \nfrom getting low enough for the disease to progress to AIDS. With antiretroviral therapy, most HIV-positive people can expect\nto live long and healthy lives, and are much less likely to infect others. However, there are two major catches. One is that HIV-positive patients \nmust keep taking their drugs for the rest of their lives. Without them, the virus can make \na deadly comeback. So, how do these drugs work? The most commonly prescribed ones\nprevent the viral genome from being copied and incorporated into a host cell's DNA. Other drugs prevent the virus\nfrom maturing or assembling, causing HIV to be unable \nto infect new cells in the body. But HIV hides out somewhere\nour current drugs cannot reach it: inside the DNA of healthy T cells. Most T cells die shortly after \nbeing infected with HIV. But in a tiny percentage, the instructions for building more HIV\nviruses lies dormant, sometimes for years. So even if we could wipe out every\nHIV virus from an infected person's body, one of those T cells could activate\nand start spreading the virus again. The other major catch is that not everyone\nin the world has access to the therapies that could save their lives. In Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts\nfor over 70% of HIV patients worldwide, antiretrovirals reached only about one\nin three HIV-positive patients in 2012. There is no easy answer to this problem. A mix of political, economic \nand cultural barriers makes effective prevention \nand treatment difficult. And even in the U.S., HIV still claims\nmore than 10,000 lives per year. However, there is ample cause for hope. Researchers may be closer than ever\nto developing a true cure.

It's called the thyroid. Like the operations manager in a company, its role is to make sure that the cells\nin your body are working properly. It does that by using hormones to deliver\nmessages to every single one of them. This high-ranking organ \nis made up of lobules that each contains smaller cells\ncalled follicles, which store the hormones \nthe thyroid sends out into your blood. Two of the most important \nhormones it produces are thyroxine and triiodothyronine,\nor T3 and T4. As messengers, the hormone's job is to instruct every cell in the body\nwhen to consume oxygen and nutrients. That maintains the body's metabolism, the series of reactions our cells perform\nto provide us with energy. This hormonal notification \nfrom the thyroid gets the heart pumping more efficiently, and makes our cells \nbreak down nutrients faster. When you need more energy, the thyroid helps by sending out \nhormones to increase metabolism. Ultimately, the thyroid allows our cells\nto use energy, grow and reproduce. The thyroid is controlled by\nthe pituitary gland, a hormonal gland deep in the brain\nthat oversees the thyroid's tasks, making sure it knows \nwhen to send out its messengers. The pituitary's role is to sense \nif hormone levels in the blood are too low or too high, in which case it sends out instructions in the form of the thyroid-\nstimulating hormone. Even in this tightly \ncontrolled system, however, management sometimes slips up. Certain diseases, growths in the thryoid or chemical imbalances in the body\ncan confuse the organ and make it deaf \nto the pituitary's guiding commands. The first problem this causes \nis hyperthyroidism, which happens when the organ sends out\ntoo many hormones. That means the cells \nare overloaded with instructions to consume nutrients and oxygen. They become overactive as a result, meaning a person with hyperthyroidism\nexperiences a higher metabolism signaled by a faster heartbeat,\nconstant hunger, and rapid weight loss. They also feel hot, sweaty, anxious,\nand find it difficult to sleep. The opposite problem is hypothyroidism, which happens when the thyroid \nsends out too few hormones, meaning the body's cells don't have\nas many messengers to guide them. In response, cells grow listless\nand metabolism slows. People with hypothyroidism\nsee symptoms in weight gain, sluggishness, sensitivity to cold, \nswollen joints and feeling low. Luckily, there are medical treatments that can help trigger \nthe thyroid's activities again, and bring the body back \nto a steady metabolic rate. For such a little organ,\nthe thyroid wields an awful lot of power. But a healthy thyroid \nmanages our cells so effectively that it can keep us running smoothly\nwithout us even noticing it's there."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Where is the thyroid situated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Near the appendix"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Behind the lungs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "In the brain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "In the neck tissue"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The pituitary controls the thyroid.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "True"}, {"label": "B", "text": "False"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The thyroid secretes hormones that:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tell the cells in the body to consume oxygen and nutrients"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Control levels of salt in the body"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Help keep the body's fat levels in check"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Keep the body's temperature stable"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The pituitary gland _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stops our bodies from becoming overloaded with sugar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Senses hormone levels in the blood"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Circulates hormones throughout the body"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Tells parts of the brain what to do"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Sadness, feeling irritated, sleepiness"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Overeating, feeling cold"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Excess energy, attention problems, swollen joints"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Weight loss, feeling hot and sweaty, constant hunger"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

This rock? That cow? Your heart? Not the things themselves, mind you,\nbut what they're made of: the atoms that are \nthe fabric of all things. To answer that question, we look to\nthe law of conservation of mass. This law says take an isolated system defined by a boundary that matter\nand energy cannot cross. Inside this system, mass, \na.k.a. matter and energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. The universe, to the best \nof our knowledge, is an isolated system. But before we get to that, let's look\nat a much smaller and simpler one. Here we have six carbon atoms, \n12 hydrogen atoms, and 18 oxygen atoms. With a little energy, \nour molecules can really get moving. These atoms can bond together\nto form familiar molecules. Here's water, and here's carbon dioxide. We can't create or destroy mass. We're stuck with what we've got,\nso what can we do? Ah, they have a mind of their own. Let's see. They've formed more \ncarbon dioxide and water, six of each. Add a little energy, and we can get them\nto reshuffle themselves to a simple sugar, and some oxygen gas. Our atoms are all accounted for:\n6 carbon, 12 hydrogen, and 18 oxygen. The energy we applied is now stored\nin the bonds between atoms. We can rerelease that energy by breaking that sugar back \ninto water and carbon dioxide, and still, same atoms. Let's put a few of our atoms aside\nand try something a little more explosive. This here is methane, most commonly \nassociated with cow flatulence, but also used for rocket fuel. If we add some oxygen\nand a little bit of energy, like you might get from a lit match, it combusts into carbon dioxide, \nwater and even more energy. Notice our methane started \nwith four hydrogen, and at the end we still have four hydrogen\ncaptured in two water molecules. For a grand finale, here's propane,\nanother combustible gas. We add oxygen, light it up,\nand boom. More water and carbon dioxide. This time we get three CO2s because the propane molecule \nstarted with three carbon atoms, and they have nowhere else to go. There are many other reactions\nwe can model with this small set of atoms, and the law of conservation of mass\nalways holds true. Whatever matter and energy \ngo into a chemical reaction are present and accounted \nfor when it's complete. So if mass can't be created or destroyed, where did these atoms \ncome from in the first place? Let's turn back the clock and see. Further, further, further, too far. Okay, there it is. The Big Bang. Our hydrogen formed from \na high-energy soup of particles in the three minutes that followed\nthe birth of our universe. Eventually, clusters of atoms accumulated\nand formed stars. Within these stars, nuclear reactions \nfused light elements, such as hydrogen and helium, to form heavier elements,\nsuch as carbon and oxygen. At first glance, these reactions \nmay look like they're breaking the law because they release \nan astounding amount of energy, seemingly out of nowhere. However, thanks to \nEinstein's famous equation, we know that energy is equivalent to mass. It turns out that the total mass \nof the starting atoms is very slightly more \nthan the mass of the products, and that loss of mass perfectly \ncorresponds to the gain in energy, which radiates out from the star as light,\nheat and energetic particles. Eventually, this star went supernova and scattered its elements across space. Long story short, they found each other\nand atoms from other supernovas, formed the Earth, and 4.6 billion years later\ngot scooped up to play their parts in our little isolated system. But they're not nearly as interesting as\nthe atoms that came together to form you, or that cow, or this rock.

{"page": 96, "lesson": 9, "title": "Did Shakespeare write his plays? - Natalya St. Clair and Aaron Williams", "category": "Performing Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/did-shakespeare-write-his-plays-natalya-st-clair-and-aaron-williams", "transcript": {"en": "\"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust\nupon them\", quoth William Shakespeare. Or did he? Some people question whether Shakespeare\nreally wrote the works that bear his name, or whether he even existed at all. They speculate that Shakespeare\nwas a pseudonym for another writer, or a group of writers. Proposed candidates \nfor the real Shakespeare include other famous playwrights, \npoliticians and even some prominent women. Could it be true that the greatest writer\nin the English language was as fictional as his plays? Most Shakespeare scholars \ndismiss these theories based on historical \nand biographical evidence. But there is another way to test\nwhether Shakespeare's famous lines were actually written by someone else. Linguistics, the study of language, can tell us a great deal about the way\nwe speak and write by examining syntax, grammar, \nsemantics and vocabulary. And in the late 1800s, a Polish philosopher \nnamed Wincenty Lutosławski formalized a method known as stylometry, applying this knowledge to investigate \nquestions of literary authorship. So how does stylometry work? The idea is that each writer's style\nhas certain characteristics that remain fairly uniform \namong individual works. Examples of characteristics include\naverage sentence length, the arrangement of words, and even the number of occurrences\nof a particular word. Let's look at use of the word thee\nand visualize it as a dimension, or axis. Each of Shakespeare's works\ncan be placed on that axis, like a data point, based on the number\nof occurrences of that word. In statistics, the tightness \nof these points gives us what is known as the variance,\nan expected range for our data. But, this is only a single characteristic\nin a very high-dimensional space. With a clustering tool\ncalled Principal Component Analysis, we can reduce the multidimensional space\ninto simple principal components that collectively measure the variance\nin Shakespeare's works. We can then test the works\nof our candidates against those principal components. For example, if enough works of Francis Bacon\nfall within the Shakespearean variance, that would be pretty strong evidence that Francis Bacon and Shakespeare\nare actually the same person. What did the results show? Well, the stylometrists who carried \nthis out have concluded that Shakespeare is none other \nthan Shakespeare. The Bard is the Bard. The pretender's works just don't match up\nwith Shakespeare's signature style. However, our intrepid \nstatisticians did find some compelling evidence \nof collaborations. For instance, one recent study concluded that Shakespeare worked with playwright\nChristopher Marlowe on \"Henry VI,\" parts one and two. Shakespeare's identity is only one of \nthe many problems stylometry can resolve. It can help us determine\nwhen a work was written, whether an ancient text is a forgery, whether a student has committed plagiarism, or if that email you just received \nis of a high priority or spam. And does the timeless poetry \nof Shakespeare's lines just boil down to numbers and statistics? Not quite. Stylometric analysis may reveal what makes\nShakespeare's works structurally distinct, but it cannot capture the beauty of\nthe sentiments and emotions they express, or why they affect us the way they do.

You've agreed on these rules: You'll roll two dice, and if the biggest number \nis one, two, three or four, player one wins. If the biggest number is five or six, \nplayer two wins. Let's try twice more. Here, player one wins, and here it's player two. So who do you want to be? At first glance, it may seem \nlike player one has the advantage since she'll win if any one \nof four numbers is the highest, but actually, player two has an approximately\n56% chance of winning each match. One way to see that is to list all\nthe possible combinations you could get by rolling two dice, and then count up \nthe ones that each player wins. These are the possibilities\nfor the yellow die. These are the possibilities \nfor the blue die. Each cell in the chart shows a possible\ncombination when you roll both dice. If you roll a four and then a five, we'll mark a player two \nvictory in this cell. A three and a one gives \nplayer one a victory here. There are 36 possible combinations, each with exactly the same \nchance of happening. Mathematicians call these\nequiprobable events. Now we can see why \nthe first glance was wrong. Even though player one \nhas four winning numbers, and player two only has two, the chance of each number \nbeing the greatest is not the same. There is only a one in 36 chance\nthat one will be the highest number. But there's an 11 in 36 chance \nthat six will be the highest. So if any of these \ncombinations are rolled, player one will win. And if any of these \ncombinations are rolled, player two will win. Out of the 36 possible combinations, 16 give the victory to player one,\nand 20 give player two the win. You could think about it this way, too. The only way player one can win is if both dice show \na one, two, three or four. A five or six would mean \na win for player two. The chance of one die showing one, two,\nthree or four is four out of six. The result of each die roll \nis independent from the other. And you can calculate the joint \nprobability of independent events by multiplying their probabilities. So the chance of getting a one, two, \nthree or four on both dice is 4/6 times 4/6, or 16/36. Because someone has to win, the chance of player two winning\nis 36/36 minus 16/36, or 20/36. Those are the exact same probabilities\nwe got by making our table. But this doesn't mean \nthat player two will win, or even that if you played 36 games\nas player two, you'd win 20 of them. That's why events like dice rolling \nare called random. Even though you can calculate \nthe theoretical probability of each outcome, you might not get the expected results\nif you examine just a few events. But if you repeat those random events\nmany, many, many times, the frequency of a specific outcome,\nlike a player two win, will approach its theoretical probability, that value we got by writing down \nall the possibilities and counting up the ones for each outcome. So, if you sat on that desert island\nplaying dice forever, player two would eventually \nwin 56% of the games, and player one would win 44%.

This organ controls your sugar levels\nand produces a special juice that releases the nutrients from your food to help keep you \nin the best possible shape. The pancreas sits just \nbehind your stomach, an appropriate home, as one of its jobs\nis to break down the food you eat. It aids digestion by producing \na special tonic made of water, sodium bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes. Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes \nthe stomach's natural acidity, so these digestive enzymes \ncan perform their jobs. Lipase breaks down fatty substances, protease splits up proteins, and amylase divides carbohydrates\nto create energy-rich sugars. Most of those nutrients then get absorbed\ninto the blood stream, and go on to enrich the body. While all this is happening, the pancreas\nworks on another critical task, controlling the amount \nof sugar in your blood. It achieves this with the hormones \ninsulin and glucagon, which are produced in special cells\ncalled the Islets of Langerhans. Having too much or too little sugar\ncan be life threatening, so the pancreas must \nstay on constant alert. After a big meal, the blood often\nbecomes flushed with sugar. To bring us back to normal,\nthe pancreas releases insulin, which makes the excess sugar \nmove into cells, where it's either used \nas an energy source, or stored for later. Insulin also tells the liver\nto shut down sugar production. On the other hand, if blood sugar is low, the pancreas releases \na hormone called glucagon that tells the body's cells and liver\nto release stored sugars back into the bloodstream. The interplay between insulin and glucagon\nis what keeps our sugar levels balanced. But a faulty pancreas can no longer \ncoach us like this, meaning that this healthy \nbalance is destroyed. If it's weakened by disease, the organ's ability to produce insulin\nmay be reduced, or even extinguished, which can trigger the condition\nknown as diabetes. Without regular insulin release,\nsugar steadily builds up in the blood, eventually hardening the blood vessels\nand causing heart attacks, kidney failure, and strokes. The same lack of insulin deprives cells\nof the energy-rich sugar they need to grow and function. People with diabetes also tend to have\nhigher levels of glucagon, which makes even more sugar circulate. Without this internal health coach,\nour sugar levels would go haywire, and we wouldn't be able \nto digest important nutrients.

But while it may seem like both of these things have been around forever, the situation looked quite different in 1850, with the Republican Party not yet existing, and support for the dominant Democrats and Whigs cutting across geographic divides. The collapse of this Second Party System was at the center of increasing regional tensions that would lead to the birth of the Republican Party, the rise of Abraham Lincoln as its leader, and a civil war that would claim over half a million lives. And if this collapse could be blamed on a single event, it would be the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. The story starts with the Missouri Compromise of 1820. To balance the number of slave states and free states in the Union, it allowed slavery in the newly admitted state of Missouri, while making it off limits in the remaining federally administered Louisiana Territory. But compromises tend to last only as long as they're convenient, and by the early 1850s, a tenacious Democratic Senator from Illionis named Stephen A. Douglas found its terms very inconvenient. As an advocate of western expansion, he promoted constructing a transcontinental railroad across the Northern Plains with an eastern terminus in Chicago, where he happened to own real estate. For his proposal to succeed, Douglas felt that the territories through which the railroad passed, would have to be formally organized, which required the support of Southern politicians. He was also a believer in popular sovereignty, arguing that the status of slavery in a territory should be decided by its residents rather than Congress. So Douglas introduced a bill designed to kill two birds with one stone. It would divide the large chunk of incorporated land into two new organized territories: Nebraska and Kansas, each of which would be open to slavery if the population voted to allow it. While Douglas and his Southern supporters tried to frame the bill as protecting the political rights of settlers, horrified Northerners recognized it as repealing the 34-year-old Missouri Compromise and feared that its supporters' ultimate goal was to extend slavery to the entire nation. Congress was able to pass the Kansas-Nebraska Act, but at the huge cost of bitterly dividing the nation, with 91% of the opposition coming from Northerners. In the House of Representatives, politicians traded insults and brandished weapons until a Sargent at Arms restored order. President Pierce signed the bill into law amidst a storm of protest, while Georgia's Alexander Stephens, future Confederate Vice President, hailed the Act's passage as, \"Glory enough for one day.\" The New York Tribune reported, \"The unanimous sentiment of the North is indignant resistance.\" Douglas even admitted that he could travel from Washington D.C. to Chicago by the light of his own burning effigies. The political consequences of the Kansas-Nebraska Act were stunning. Previously, both Whigs and Democrats had included Northern and Southern lawmakers united around various issues, but now slavery became a dividing factor that could not be ignored. Congressmen from both parties spoke out against the act, including an Illinois Whig named Abraham Lincoln, denouncing \"the monstrous injustice of slavery\" in an 1854 speech. By this time the Whigs had all but ceased to exist, irreparably split between their Northern and Southern factions. In the same year, the new Republican Party was founded by the anti-slavery elements from both existing parties. Although Lincoln still ran for Senate as a Whig in 1854, he was an early supporter of the new party, and helped to recruit others to its cause. Meanwhile the Democratic Party was shaken when events in the newly formed Kansas Territory revealed the violent consequences of popular sovereignty. Advertisements appeared across the North imploring people to emigrate to Kansas to stem the advance of slavery. The South answered with Border Ruffians, pro-slavery Missourians who crossed state lines to vote in fraudulent elections and raid anti-slavery settlements. One northern abolitionist, John Brown, became notorious following the Pottawatomie Massacre of 1856 when he and his sons hacked to death five pro-slavery farmers with broad swords. In the end, more than 50 people died in Bleeding Kansas. While nominally still a national party, Douglas's Democrats were increasingly divided along sectional lines, and many Northern members left to join the Republicans. Abraham Lincoln finally took up the Republican Party banner in 1856 and never looked back. That year, John C. Fremont, the first Republican presidential candidate, lost to Democrat, James Buchanan, but garnered 33% of the popular vote all from Northern states. Two years later, Lincoln challenged Douglas for his Illinois Senate seat, and although he lost that contest, it elevated his status among Republicans. Lincoln would finally be vindicated in 1860, when he was elected President of the United States, defeating in his own home state, a certain Northern Democrat, who was finally undone by the disastrous aftermath of the law he had masterminded.

The history of human progress\nis one of ever-increasing velocity, and one of the most important achievements\nin this historical race was the breaking of the sound barrier. Not long after the first\nsuccessful airplane flights, pilots were eager to push\ntheir planes to go faster and faster. But as they did so, increased turbulence and large forces on the plane\nprevented them from accelerating further. Some tried to circumvent\nthe problem through risky dives, often with tragic results. Finally, in 1947, design improvements, such as a movable horizontal stabilizer,\nthe all-moving tail, allowed an American military pilot\nnamed Chuck Yeager to fly the Bell X-1 aircraft at 1127 km/h, becoming the first person\nto break the sound barrier and travel faster than the speed of sound. The Bell X-1 was the first of many\nsupersonic aircraft to follow, with later designs reaching\nspeeds over Mach 3. Aircraft traveling at supersonic speed\ncreate a shock wave with a thunder-like noise\nknown as a sonic boom, which can cause distress to people\nand animals below or even damage buildings. For this reason, scientists around the world\nhave been looking at sonic booms, trying to predict their path\nin the atmosphere, where they will land,\nand how loud they will be. To better understand\nhow scientists study sonic booms, let's start with some basics of sound. Imagine throwing a small stone\nin a still pond. What do you see? The stone causes waves\nto travel in the water at the same speed in every direction. These circles that keep growing in radius\nare called wave fronts. Similarly, even though we cannot see it, a stationary sound source,\nlike a home stereo, creates sound waves traveling outward. The speed of the waves depends on factors like the altitude and temperature\nof the air they move through. At sea level, sound travels\nat about 1225 km/h. But instead of circles\non a two-dimensional surface, the wave fronts\nare now concentric spheres, with the sound traveling along rays\nperpendicular to these waves. Now imagine a moving sound source,\nsuch as a train whistle. As the source keeps moving\nin a certain direction, the successive waves in front of it\nwill become bunched closer together. This greater wave frequency is the cause\nof the famous Doppler effect, where approaching objects\nsound higher pitched. But as long as the source is moving\nslower than the sound waves themselves, they will remain nested within each other. It's when an object goes supersonic,\nmoving faster than the sound it makes, that the picture changes dramatically. As it overtakes sound waves\nit has emitted, while generating new ones from\nits current position, the waves are forced together,\nforming a Mach cone. No sound is heard\nas it approaches an observer because the object is traveling faster\nthan the sound it produces. Only after the object has passed\nwill the observer hear the sonic boom. Where the Mach cone meets the ground,\nit forms a hyperbola, leaving a trail known as the boom carpet\nas it travels forward. This makes it possible to determine\nthe area affected by a sonic boom. What about figuring out how strong\na sonic boom will be? This involves solving the famous\nNavier-Stokes equations to find the variation\nof pressure in the air due to the supersonic aircraft\nflying through it. This results in the pressure signature\nknown as the N-wave. What does this shape mean? Well, the sonic boom occurs\nwhen there is a sudden change in pressure, and the N-wave involves two booms: one for the initial pressure rise\nat the aircraft's nose, and another for when the tail passes, and the pressure suddenly\nreturns to normal. This causes a double boom, but it is usually heard as a single boom\nby human ears. In practice, computer models\nusing these principles can often predict the location\nand intensity of sonic booms for given atmospheric conditions\nand flight trajectories, and there is ongoing research\nto mitigate their effects. In the meantime, supersonic flight\nover land remains prohibited. So, are sonic booms a recent creation? Not exactly. While we try to find ways to silence them, a few other animals have been\nusing sonic booms to their advantage. The gigantic Diplodocus may have been\ncapable of cracking its tail faster than sound, at over 1200 km/h,\npossibly to deter predators. Some types of shrimp can also create\na similar shock wave underwater, stunning or even killing pray\nat a distance with just a snap of their oversized claw. So while we humans\nhave made great progress in our relentless pursuit of speed, it turns out that nature was there first."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "If a train is travelling towards you, the train whistle sounds _____", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Louder"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Softer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Higher pitched"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lower pitched"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "When would you hear a sonic boom?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Before a supersonic aircraft passes by"}, {"label": "B", "text": "After a supersonic aircraft has passed by"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When the speed of sound is 1127 km/h"}, {"label": "D", "text": "When the speed of the aircraft is less than the speed of sound"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "When is a sonic boom generated?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When an object's speed exceeds the speed of sound it produces"}, {"label": "B", "text": "When an object's speed is less than the speed of sound it produces"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When the speed of sound is 1225 km/h"}, {"label": "D", "text": "An aircraft flies"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The speed of sound depends on:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Temperature"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The speed of the aircraft"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Direction"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The type of the sound source"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The Mach number is equal to:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The speed of the aircraft"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The ratio of the sound speed to the speed of the aircraft"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The ratio of the speed of the aircraft to the sound speed"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Three"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

Behind the sudden urge that follows\nare two bean-shaped organs that work as fine-tuned internal sensors. They balance the amount of fluid\nin your body, detect waste in your blood, and know when to release \nthe vitamins, minerals, and hormones you need to stay alive. Say hello to your kidneys. The main role of these organs\nis to dispose of waste products and to turn them into urine. The body's eight liters of blood\npass through the kidneys between 20 and 25 times each day, meaning that, together, these organs filter\nabout 180 liters every 24 hours. The ingredients in your blood\nare constantly changing as you ingest food and drink, which explains why \nthe kidneys need to be on permanent duty. Blood enters each kidney through arteries\nthat branch and branch, until they form tiny vessels that entwine\nwith special internal modules, called nephrons. In each kidney, 1 million of these nephrons form \na powerful array of filters and sensors that carefully sift through the blood. This is where we see just how refined and accurate this internal \nsensing system is. To filter the blood, each nephron\nuses two powerful pieces of equipment: a blob-like structure called a glomerulus,\nand a long, stringy, straw-like tubule. The glomerulus works like a sieve,\nallowing only certain ingredients, such as vitamins and minerals,\nto pass into the tubule. Then, this vessel's job is to detect whether any of those ingredients \nare needed in the body. If so, they're reabsorbed in amounts\nthat the body needs, so they can circulate in the blood again. But the blood doesn't only \ncarry useful ingredients. It contains waste products, too. And the nephrons have to figure out \nwhat to do with them. The tubules sense compounds \nthe body doesn't need, like urea, left over from \nthe breakdown of proteins, and redirects them as urine \nout of the kidneys and through two long sewers\ncalled ureters. The tubes empty their contents\ninto the bladder to be discharged, ridding your body of that waste\nonce and for all. There's water in that urine, too. If the kidney detects too much of it\nin your blood, for instance, when you've chugged\nseveral glasses at once, it sends the extra liquid\nto the bladder to be removed. On the other hand,\nlow water levels in the blood prompt the kidney to release some\nback into the blood stream, meaning that less water \nmakes it into the urine. This is why urine appears yellower\nwhen you're less hydrated. By controlling water, your kidneys\nstabilize the body's fluid levels. But this fine balancing act\nisn't the kidney's only skill. These organs have the power \nto activate vitamin D to secrete a hormone called renin\nthat raises blood pressure, and another hormone \ncalled erythropoietin, which increases red blood cell production. Without the kidneys, our bodily fluids \nwould spiral out of control. Every time we ate, our blood would receive\nanother load of unsifted ingredients. Soon, the buildup of waste would overload\nour systems and we'd expire. So each kidney not only \nkeeps things running smoothly. It also keeps us alive.

Freeman and Gregory Taylor", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-shakespeare-loved-iambic-pentameter-david-t-freeman-and-gregory-taylor", "transcript": {"en": "To someone first encountering\nthe works of William Shakespeare, the language may seem strange. But there is a secret to appreciating it. Although he was famous for his plays,\nShakespeare was first and foremost a poet. One of the most important things \nin Shakespeare's language is his use of stress. Not that kind of stress, but the way we emphasize certain \nsyllables in words more than others. We're so used to doing this\nthat we may not notice it at first. But if you say the word slowly,\nyou can easily identify them. Playwright, computer, telephone. Poets are very aware of these stresses, having long experimented with the number and order of stressed \nand unstressed syllables, and combined them in different ways\nto create rhythm in their poems. Like songwriters, poets often express their ideas through \na recognizable repetition of these rhythms or poetic meter. And like music, poetry has its own set of terms \nfor describing this. In a line of verse, a foot is a certain number \nof stressed and unstressed syllables forming a distinct unit, just as a musical measure\nconsists of a certain number of beats. One line of verse is usually made\nup of several feet. For example, a dactyl is a metrical \nfoot of three syllables with the first stressed, and the second\nand third unstressed. Dactyls can create lines\nthat move swiftly and gather force, as in Robert Browning's poem, \n\"The Lost Leader.\" \"Just for a handful of silver he left us.\nJust for a rib and to stick in his coat.\" Another kind of foot \nis the two-syllable long trochee, a stressed syllable \nfollowed by an unstressed one. The trochees in these lines \nfrom Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" lend an ominous and spooky tone\nto the witches' chant. \"Double, double, toil and trouble;\nfire burn and cauldron bubble.\" But with Shakespeare,\nit's all about the iamb. This two-syllable foot \nis like a reverse trochee, so the first syllable is unstressed\nand the second is stressed, as in, \"To be, or not to be.\" Shakespeare's favorite meter, \nin particular, was iambic pentameter, where each line of verse\nis made up of five two-syllable iambs, for a total of ten syllables. And it's used for many \nof Shakespeare's most famous lines: \"Shall I compare thee\nto a summer's day?\" \"Arise fair sun, \nand kill the envious moon.\" Notice how the iambs cut across\nboth punctuation and word separation. Meter is all about sound, not spelling. Iambic pentameter may sound technical, but there's an easy way \nto remember what it means. The word iamb is pronounced\njust like the phrase, \"I am.\" Now, let's expand that to a sentence that just happens \nto be in iambic pentameter. \"I am a pirate with a wooden leg.\" The pirate can only walk in iambs, a living reminder \nof Shakespeare's favorite meter. Iambic pentameter \nis when he takes ten steps. Our pirate friend can even help us \nremember how to properly mark it if we image the footprints he leaves\nwalking along a deserted island beach: A curve for unstressed syllables,\nand a shoe outline for stressed ones. \"If music be the food of love, play on.\" Of course, most lines \nof Shakespeare's plays are written in regular prose. But if you read carefully, you'll notice that Shakespeare's \ncharacters turn to poetry, and iambic pentameter in particular, for many of the same reasons \nthat we look to poetry in our own lives. Feeling passionate, introspective,\nor momentous. Whether it's Hamlet pondering \nhis existence, or Romeo professing his love, the characters switch to iambic pentameter\nwhen speaking about their emotions and their place in the world. Which leaves just one last question. Why did Shakespeare choose \niambic pentameter for these moments, rather than, say, trochaic hexameter\nor dactylic tetrameter? It's been said that iambic pentameter \nwas easy for his actors to memorize and for the audience to understand because it's naturally suited \nto the English language. But there might be another reason. The next time you're in a heightened \nemotional situation, like the ones that make \nShakespeare's characters burst into verse, put your hand over \nthe left side of your chest. What do you feel? That's your heart beating in iambs. Da duhm, da duhm, \nda duhm, da duhm, da duhm. Shakespeare's most poetic lines don't just\ntalk about matters of the heart.

May", "category": "Design, Engineering & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-do-buildings-fall-in-earthquakes-vicki-v-may", "transcript": {"en": "Earthquakes have always been \na terrifying phenomenon, and they've become more deadly\nas our cities have grown, with collapsing buildings posing\none of the largest risks. Why do buildings collapse \nin an earthquake, and how can it be prevented? If you've watched a lot of disaster films, you might have the idea that building collapse is caused directly\nby the ground beneath them shaking violently,\nor even splitting apart. But that's not really how it works. For one thing, most buildings\nare not located right on a fault line, and the shifting tectonic plates \ngo much deeper than building foundations. So what's actually going on? In fact, the reality of earthquakes\nand their effect on buildings is a bit more complicated. To make sense of it,\narchitects and engineers use models, like a two-dimensional array of lines\nrepresenting columns and beams, or a single line lollipop with circles \nrepresenting the building's mass. Even when simplified to this degree,\nthese models can be quite useful, as predicting a building's response\nto an earthquake is primarily a matter of physics. Most collapses that occur \nduring earthquakes aren't actually caused \nby the earthquake itself. Instead, when the ground moves\nbeneath a building, it displaces the foundation \nand lower levels, sending shock waves through \nthe rest of the structure and causing it to vibrate back and forth. The strength of this oscillation\ndepends on two main factors: the building's mass, \nwhich is concentrated at the bottom, and its stiffness, which is the force required \nto cause a certain amount of displacement. Along with the building's material type\nand the shape of its columns, stiffness is largely a matter of height. Shorter buildings tend to be stiffer\nand shift less, while taller buildings are more flexible. You might think that the solution\nis to build shorter buildlings so that they shift as little as possible. But the 1985 Mexico City earthquake is\na good example of why that's not the case. During the quake, many buildings between six \nand fifteen stories tall collapsed. What's strange is that while shorter\nbuildings nearby did keep standing, buildings taller than fifteen stories\nwere also less damaged, and the midsized buildings that collapsed were observed shaking far more violently\nthan the earthquake itself. How is that possible? The answer has to do with something\nknown as natural frequency. In an oscillating system, the frequency is how many back and forth\nmovement cycles occur within a second. This is the inverse of the period, which is how many seconds it takes\nto complete one cycle. And a building's natural frequency,\ndetermined by its mass and stiffness, is the frequency that its vibrations \nwill tend to cluster around. Increasing a building's mass slows down\nthe rate at which it naturally vibrates, while increasing stiffness\nmakes it vibrate faster. So in the equation representing\ntheir relationship, stiffness and natural frequency\nare proportional to one another, while mass and natural frequency\nare inversely proportional. What happened in Mexico City\nwas an effect called resonance, where the frequency \nof the earthquake's seismic waves happen to match the natural frequency\nof the midsized buildings. Like a well-timed push on a swingset, each additional seismic wave\namplified the building's vibration in its current direction, causing it to swing even further back,\nand so on, eventually reaching a far greater extent\nthan the initial displacement. Today, engineers work \nwith geologists and seismologists to predict the frequency \nof earthquake motions at building sites in order to prevent \nresonance-induced collapses, taking into account factors\nsuch as soil type and fault type, as well as data from previous quakes. Low frequencies of motion \nwill cause more damage to taller and more flexible buildings, while high frequencies of motion\npose more threat to structures that \nare shorter and stiffer. Engineers have also devised ways\nto abosrb shocks and limit deformation\nusing innovative systems. Base isolation uses flexible layers to isolate the foundation's displacement\nfrom the rest of the building, while tuned mass damper systems\ncancel out resonance by oscillating out of phase\nwith the natural frequency to reduce vibrations. In the end, it's not the sturdiest \nbuildings that will remain standing but the smartest ones."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "A stiffer building will _____ than a more flexible building under the same applied loading.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Displace less"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Displace more"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Displace the same amount"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "As the mass of a building increases, the natural frequency of the building or rate oscillation:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increases, the building wants to move back and forth faster"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decreases, the building wants to move back and forth slower"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Remains the same"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "As the stiffness of a building increases, the natural frequency of the building or rate of oscillation:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Increases, the building wants to move back and forth faster"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Decreases, the building wants to move back and forth slower"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Remains the same"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The natural period of a building is:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The inverse of the natural frequency"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Is measured in seconds"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Is measured in Hertz"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A and B"}, {"label": "E", "text": "A and C"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "A shorter building will tend to be _____ than a taller building", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stiffer"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Stronger"}, {"label": "C", "text": "More flexible"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Weaker"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

But it is actually a complex \nand finely balanced natural system, and its extreme location \nmakes it vulnerable to feedback processes that can magnify even tiny changes\nin the atmosphere. In fact, scientists often describe \nthe Arctic as the canary in the coal mine when it comes to predicting the impact\nof climate change. One major type of climate feedback\ninvolves reflectivity. White surfaces, like snow and ice, are very effective at reflecting\nthe sun's energy back into space, while darker land and water surfaces\nabsorb much more incoming sunlight. When the Arctic warms just a little,\nsome of the snow and ice melts, exposing the ground and ocean underneath. The increased heat absorbed by\nthese surfaces causes even more melting, and so on. And although the current situation\nin the Arctic follows the warming pattern, the opposite is also possible. A small drop in temperatures\nwould cause more freezing, increasing the amount \nof reflective snow and ice. This would result in less sunlight \nbeing absorbed, and lead to a cycle of cooling,\nas in previous ice ages. Arctic sea ice is also responsible\nfor another feedback mechanism through insulation. By forming a layer on the ocean's surface, the ice acts as a buffer between\nthe frigid arctic air and the relatively \nwarmer water underneath. But when it thins, breaks, \nor melts in any spot, heat escapes from the ocean, warming the atmosphere \nand causing more ice to melt in turn. Both of these are examples\nof positive feedback loops, not because they do something good, but because the initial change \nis amplified in the same direction. A negative feedback loop,\non the other hand, is when the initial change\nleads to effects that work in the opposite direction. Melting ice also causes \na type of negative feedback by releasing moisture into the atmosphere. This increases the amount and thickness\nof clouds present, which can cool the atmosphere\nby blocking more sunlight. But this negative feedback loop\nis short-lived, due to the brief Arctic summers. For the rest of the year, \nwhen sunlight is scarce, the increased moisture and clouds actually warm the surface\nby trapping the Earth's heat, turning the feedback loop positive\nfor all but a couple of months. While negative feedback loops\nencourage stability by pushing a system towards equilibrium, positive feedback loops destabilize it\nby enabling larger and larger deviations. And the recently increased impact\nof positive feedbacks may have consequences \nfar beyond the Arctic. On a warming planet, these feedbacks ensure that the North Pole\nwarms at a faster rate than the equator. The reduced temperature differences\nbetween the two regions may lead to slower jet stream winds and less linear atmospheric circulation\nin the middle latitudes, where most of the world's \npopulation lives. Many scientists are concerned\nthat shifts in weather patterns will last longer and be more extreme, with short term fluctuations becoming\npersistent cold snaps, heat waves, droughts and floods. So the Arctic sensitivity doesn't just\nserve as an early warning alarm for climate change \nfor the rest of the planet. Its feedback loops can affect us\nin much more direct and immediate ways.

If you saw one man gaining too much power,\nwould you try to stop him? Even if that man was\none of your closest friends and allies? These were the questions haunting Roman\nSenator Marcus Junius Brutus in 44 BCE, the year Julius Caesar \nwould be assassinated. Opposing unchecked power wasn’t\njust a political matter for Brutus; it was a personal one. He claimed descent\nfrom Lucius Junius Brutus, who had helped overthrow the tyrannical\nking known as Tarquin the Proud. Instead of seizing power himself, the elder Brutus\nled the people in a rousing oath to never again allow a king to rule. Rome became a republic, based on the principle that no one man\nshould hold too much power. Now, four and a half centuries later,\nthis principle was threatened. Julius Ceasar's rise \nto the powerful position of consul had been dramatic. Years of military triumphs \nhad made him the wealthiest man in Rome. And after defeating his rival\nPompey the Great in a bitter civil war, his power was at its peak. His victories and initiatives, \nsuch as distributing lands to the poor, had made him popular with the public, and many senators vied for his favor \nby showering him with honors. Statues were built, \ntemples were dedicated, and a whole month was renamed,\nstill called July today. More importantly, the title of dictator, meant to grant temporary\nemergency powers in wartime, had been bestowed upon Caesar \nseveral times in succession. And in 44 BCE, \nhe was made dictator perpetuo, dictator for a potentially unlimited term. All of this was too much for the senators who feared a return to the monarchy\ntheir ancestors had fought to abolish, as well as those whose \nown power and ambition were impeded by Caesar's rule. A group of conspirators \ncalling themselves the liberators began to secretly discuss\nplans for assassination. Leading them were\nthe senator Gaius Cassius Longinus and his friend and brother-in-law, Brutus. Joining the conspiracy was\nnot an easy choice for Brutus. Even though Brutus had sided with Pompey \nin the ill-fated civil war, Caesar had personally intervened \nto save his life, not only pardoning him\nbut even accepting him as a close advisor and elevating him to important posts. Brutus was hesitant to conspire against\nthe man who had treated him like a son, but in the end, Cassius's insistence and Brutus's own fear\nof Caesar's ambitions won out. The moment they had been waiting\nfor came on March 15. At a senate meeting held shortly before Caesar was to depart\non his next military campaign, as many as 60 conspirators surrounded him, unsheathing daggers from their togas\nand stabbing at him from all sides. As the story goes, Caesar struggled fiercely\nuntil he saw Brutus. Despite the famous line, \"Et tu, Brute?\" \nwritten by Shakespeare, we don't know Caesar's actual dying words. Some ancient sources claim\nhe said nothing, while others record the phrase,\n“And you, child?” fueling speculation that Brutus may have\nactually been Caesar's illegitimate son. But all agree that when \nCaesar saw Brutus among his attackers, he covered his face and gave up the fight, falling to the ground \nafter being stabbed 23 times. Unfortunately for Brutus, he and the other conspirators \nhad underestimated Caesar's popularity among the Roman public, many of whom saw \nhim as an effective leader, and the senate as a corrupt aristocracy. Within moments of Caesar's assassination,\nRome was in a state of panic. Most of the other senators had fled, while the assassins barricaded themselves\non the Capitoline Hill. Mark Antony, \nCaesar's friend and co-consul, was swift to seize the upper hand, delivering a passionate speech \nat Caesar's funeral days later that whipped the crowd into a frenzy \nof grief and anger. As a result, the liberators \nwere forced out of Rome. The ensuing power vacuum \nled to a series of civil wars, during which Brutus, \nfacing certain defeat, took his own life. Ironically, the ultimate result would be the opposite of what\nthe conspirators had hoped to accomplish: the end of the Republic and the concentration of power \nunder the office of Emperor. Opinions over the assassination of Caesar \nwere divided from the start and have remained so. As for Brutus himself, few historical figures have inspired \nsuch a conflicting legacy. In Dante's \"Inferno,\" he was placed \nin the very center of Hell and eternally chewed by Satan himself\nfor his crime of betrayal. But Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" described him as one of the most virtuous\nand benevolent people to have lived. The interpretation of Brutus as either\na selfless fighter against dictatorship or an opportunistic traitor has shifted with the tides \nof history and politics. But even today, over 2,000 years later, questions about the price of liberty, the conflict between \npersonal loyalties and universal ideals, and unintended consequences\nremain more relevant than ever."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Which tyrannical king did Lucius Junius Brutus help expel?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tarquin the Proud"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Tarquin the Cruel"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Tarquin the Ugly"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What was the fundamental principle of the Roman Republic?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "That no one man should hold too much power"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That one man should hold all the power"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That everyone should share the power in a democratic system of government"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which position was permanently granted to Julius Caesar in 44 BCE?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "King"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Dictator"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Prime Minister"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What was the name of Brutus' main co-conspirator and brother-in-law?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Catullus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Casca"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Cassius"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How many times was Caesar stabbed?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "3"}, {"label": "B", "text": "23"}, {"label": "C", "text": "33"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 96, "lesson": 20, "title": "How do the lungs work? - Emma Bryce", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-do-the-lungs-do-emma-bryce", "transcript": {"en": "Many of us have hundreds of things\non our minds at any moment, often struggling to keep track\nof everything we need to do. But fortunately, there's one important thing\nwe don't have to worry about remembering: breathing. When you breathe, you transport oxygen\nto the body's cells to keep them working and clear your system \nof the carbon dioxide that this work generates. Breathing, in other words,\nkeeps the body alive. So, how do we accomplish \nthis crucial and complex task without even thinking about it? The answer lies \nin our body's respiratory system. Like any machinery,\nit consists of specialized components, and requires a trigger \nto start functioning. Here, the components are the structures \nand tissues making up the lungs, as well as the various other \nrespiratory organs connected to them. And to get this machine moving,\nwe need the autonomic nervous system, our brain's unconscious control center\nfor the vital functions. As the body prepares \nto take in oxygen-rich air, this system sends a signal \nto the muscles around your lungs, flattening the diaphragm and contracting the intercostal muscles \nbetween your ribs to create more space \nfor the lungs to expand. Air then wooshes into your nose and mouth, through your trachea, and into the bronchi\nthat split at the trachea's base, with one entering each lung. Like tree branches, these small tubes \ndivide into thousands of tinier passages called bronchioles. It's tempting to think of the lungs \nas huge balloons, but instead of being hollow,\nthey're actually spongy inside, with the bronchioles running \nthroughout the parenchyma tissue. At the end of each bronchiole \nis a little air sack called an alveolus, wrapped in capillaries \nfull of red blood cells containing special proteins \ncalled hemoglobin. The air you've breathed in\nfills these sacks, causing the lungs to inflate. Here is where the vital exchange occurs. At this point, the capillaries\nare packed with carbon dioxide, and the air sacks are full of oxygen. But due to the basic process of diffusion, the molecules of each gas \nwant to move to a place where there's a lower concentration \nof their kind. So as oxygen crosses over \nto the capillaries, the hemoglobin grabs it up, while the carbon dioxide \nis unloaded into the lungs. The oxygen-rich hemoglobin \nis then transported throughout the body via the bloodstream. But what do our lungs do \nwith all that carbon dioxide? Exhale it, of course. The autonomic nervous system \nkicks in again, causing the diaphragm to ball up, and the intercostal muscles to relax, making the chest cavities smaller\nand forcing the lungs to compress. The carbon dioxide-rich air is expelled,\nand the cycle begins again. So that's how these spongy organs keep\nour bodies efficiently supplied with air. Lungs inhale and exhale \nbetween 15 and 25 times a minute, which amounts to an incredible \n10,000 liters of air each day. That's a lot of work, but don't sweat it. Your lungs and \nyour autonomic nervous system have got it covered."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What controls the movement of the lungs?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "The ribcage"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Your heart rate"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The diaphragm"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The autonomic nervous system"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "From largest to smallest, the airways are structured as follows:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Alveoli, bronchi, trachea, bronchioles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Trachea, bronchioles, bronchi, alveoli"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Bronchi, alveolus, bronchioles, trachea"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "_____ drives O2 and CO2 across the capillaries and air sacs in the lungs.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Breathing"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Inhalation"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Diffusion"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Heat"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do the lungs get rid of all the CO2 they've picked up from the blood?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They convert it into oxygen"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They inhale to bring in fresh air"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They send it back into the bloodstream"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They compress and exhale"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Pick the true statement:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "If we forget we're breathing our lungs work much better"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The autonomic nervous system makes breathing automatic"}, {"label": "C", "text": "If we forget to breathe the brain reminds us"}, {"label": "D", "text": "We have to focus on breathing"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
