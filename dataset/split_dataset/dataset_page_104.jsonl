It came to hold her bones, \nalong with the life force they carried, and was eventually passed\nto her grandson, Paka’a. He learned the hundreds of distinct winds that wafted and whipped \naround his homeland. Chanting their names, he could stir \nthe skies and raise the waves. Like his father before him, he became the most trusted attendant\nto King Keawenuia’umi of Hawaii Island. But his privileged status\nalso made him a target. Two of the king's seafaring navigators\nwere especially envious. They knew Paka’a’s skills\nand responsibility to the king were divinely inherited,\nbut they coveted his position. So they whispered rumors\nand eventually turned the king against his most loyal companion. Paka’a watched bitterly as he was stripped\nof his land and privileges. He fled, escaping the navigators who\nplotted to drown him as he sailed away, and took refuge on Molokaʻi, \nwhere he married a young chiefess. They brought a son into the world, but Paka’a never stopped\nimagining his return. He taught his son, Kuapaka’a,\nthe way of the winds until Kuapaka’a was poised \nto avenge his father and restore his rightful place \nbeside the king. Back on Hawaii Island, as the two navigators revealed\ntheir selfishness, the king realized how easily he’d been\ndeceived and longed for Paka’a. Some of his more trustworthy attendants\ndivined that Paka’a was still alive and told the king to construct\ncanoes for a journey. However, Paka’a could not\nreturn so easily. First, the king’s loyalty and dedication\nhad to be tested. As the king rallied his attendants, Paka’a’s ancestral spirits arrived \nin the form of two birds and rotted the trees he was using \nfor canoe-building. Though exhausted, the king had \nhis best archers shoot the birds, and he started again. Later, as Paka’a dreamed, \nthe king’s spirit announced his search. However, Paka’a’s own spirit \nmisled the king, saying he was on Ka’ula— not Molokaʻi. The king’s fleet soon set sail. As they passed Molokaʻi, \nPaka’a’s son, Kuapaka’a, greeted them, warning that a storm was brewing. He chanted the names of the winds,\nbut kept his identity a secret, as per Paka’a’s plan. The king’s navigators dismissed \nthe young boy’s claims. But as they sailed off, \nKuapaka’a unleashed a vicious storm and all were forced to shelter\non Molokaʻi. For four months, \nKuapaka’a maintained the storm. With Paka’a’s secret supervision,\nhe earned the king’s trust, and, after clearing the sky, Kuapaka’a\nagreed to join the king’s search. At sea, the two navigators continuously\ndiscredited Kuapaka’a. Finally, he readied himself for revenge\nand called the winds. As waves crashed, \nKuapaka’a anchored the canoe and passed provisions to everyone—\nexcept the two navigators. They grew cold and weak, \neventually falling overboard. But Kuapaka’a’s work wasn’t done. While everyone slept, \nhe brightened the sky and sailed towards Hawaii Island \ninstead of Ka’ula. Though the king regretted\nnot finding Paka’a, everyone was glad to be home \nand forgot about Kuapaka’a— until the day he proposed a canoe race. He wagered his catch of flying fish\nagainst that of eight fishermen who had been appointed \nby the two treacherous navigators. They agreed, figuring it'd be an easy win. But Kuapaka’a called to La’amaomao, and a great wave whisked him\nahead of his opponents. Enraged and convinced this was a fluke,\nthe fishermen asked for a rematch. But this time, they demanded Kuapaka’a\nwager his bones against theirs. At first, the men paddled fiercely, with Kuapaka’a gliding effortlessly\nin their wake. As they tired, Kuapaka’a hurtled \nhimself to victory. Hearing that eight of his fishermen \nwere to die, the king asked Kuapaka’a \nto have mercy on them. But the time had come for Kuapaka’a\nto reveal his identity and have the King prove \nhis commitment to Paka’a. Overcome, the king agreed to their deaths\nand asked to welcome Paka’a home, promising his lands and position\nwould be restored. At last, the king and Paka’a \nwere back at each other’s sides. Wielding the sacred wind gourd, Paka’a and Kuapaka’a ensured the names\nof the winds would never be lost, and those who understood them \nnever undermined or forgotten."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What is the name of the Hawaiʻi Island King who the narrative is about?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Keawenuiaumi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Kamehameha"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Lonoikamakahiki"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Kalākaua"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The wind gourd of Laʻamaomao contains what?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "All the winds of Hawaiʻi"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The bones of the wind goddess"}, {"label": "C", "text": "When called, the power to direct the winds and waves"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "On which island did Pākaʻa flee?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oʻahu"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Molokaʻi"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Kauaʻi"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Maui"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What were the roles of Pākaʻa’s two enemies?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Farmers"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Fishermen"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Navigators"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Pākaʻa ancestral spirits falsely revealed where Pākaʻa was hiding to the King in a dream.
