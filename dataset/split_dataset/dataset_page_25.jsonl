You’re the only person skilled \nenough to shut it down, and you’ll only have one chance. You’ve broken into NIM’s secret lab, and now you’re floating in a raft on top \nof 25 stories of electrified water. You’ve rigged up a remote \nthat can lower the water level by ejecting it from grates \nin the sides of the room. If you can lower the water level to 0, you can hit the manual override, shut NIM off, and save the day. However, the AI knows that you’re here,\nand it can lower the water level, too, by sucking it through a trapdoor \nat the bottom of the lab. If NIM is the one to lower \nthe water level to 0, you’ll be sucked out of the lab, resulting in a failed mission. Control over water drainage \nalternates between you and NIM, and neither can skip a turn. Each of you can lower the water level \nby exactly 1, 3, or 4 stories at a time. Whoever gets the level\nexactly to 0 on their turn will win this deadly duel. Note that neither of you can lower \nthe water below 0; if the water level is at 2, then the only move is to lower \nthe water level 1 story. You know that NIM has already computed \nall possible outcomes of the contest, and will play in a way that maximizes \nits chance of success. You go first. How can you survive \nand shut off the artificial intelligence? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You can’t leave anything up to chance -\nNIM will take any advantage it can get. And you’ll need to have a response \nto any possible move it makes. The trick here is to start from where \nyou want to end and work backwards. You want to be the one to lower \nthe water level to 0, which means you need the water level \nto be at 1, 3, or 4 when control switches to you. If the water level were at 2, your only option would be\nto lower it 1 story, which would lead \nto NIM making the winning move. If we color code the water levels, we can see a simple principle at play: there are “losing” levels like 2, where no matter what whoever starts \ntheir turn there does, they’ll lose. And there are winning levels,\nwhere whoever starts their turn there can either win or leave their opponent \nwith a losing level. So not only are 1, 3, \nand 4 winning levels, but so are 5 and 6, since you can send your opponent \nto 2 from there. What about 7? From 7, all possible moves would \nsend your opponent to a winning level, making this another losing level. And we can continue up \nthe lab in this way. If you start your turn 1, 3,\nor 4 levels above a losing level, then you’re at a winning level. Otherwise, you’re destined to lose. You could continue like this \nall the way to level 25. But as a shortcut, you might notice that levels 8 through 11\nare colored identically to 1 through 4. Since a level’s color is determined by\nthe levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it, this means that level 12 \nwill be the same color as level 5, 13 will match 6, 14 will match 7, and so on, In particular, the losing levels \nwill always be multiple of 7, and two greater than multiples of 7. Now, from your original \nstarting level of 25, you have to make sure your opponent starts\non a losing level every single turn— if NIM starts on a winning level \neven once, it’s game over for you. So your only choice on turn 1 \nis to lower the water level by 4 stories. No matter what the AI does, you can continue giving it losing levels until you reach 0 \nand trigger the manual override. And with that, the crisis is averted.

At the same time Richard Strauss another composer\nliving in the same city basically was conducting his own music like this. You know, barely moving and if you think this is a quiet part in his music you're\nwrong. He thought the role of a conductor was to organize the music and keep\neverything calm. Our biggest job as a conductor, it's to do justice to the\ncomposer. My name is James Gaffigan I am a conductor. What the public needs to\nunderstand about conducting is it's an anticipatory art, so what we do takes\nplace before the music happens. Rhythmic hand goes up before the music starts and\nthis hand will give a gesture before that sound. I've always found it strange to hold a baton and it's a very strange thing,\nbecause why why is it there in the first place? But the fact of the matter is is\nit is an extension of your arm. If you just make a gesture like this, you just\nneed to move your wrist and you don't have to be doing this all the time. Your right hand is mainly for keeping rhythm or keeping the beat patterns, so if you\ngive an upbeat this is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4. If you have 2 4, it's very simple so 1 2\n1 2 and you could be as small as this they'll realize that this is 2 4. From the left hand has a much more complex, strange role in our physical world and\nit's freer to do things that are out of the\nordinary. It could be anything from showing where a phrase goes, it could show speed of a bow. String players are very physical in the sense\nthat they they react to what they see. If you have your left hand open and if you\nhave your right hand slightly open and you're holding this sound like as if\nyou'd hold a baby they'll play that way. If you conduct like this they're gonna play like this. Percussion needs clarity\nfrom a conductor. They need to know where to hit something and the bass drum could\nplay only one note in an hour-long symphony, but that note is very important. The worst thing you could do to a brass\nplayer before he or she plays is this. Because if they see the hand before they\nhave to make the beautiful sound that they need to make it's gonna destroy\ntheir confidence and it's gonna make their lives very difficult. Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person needs to think about and it's such a\ndelicate instrument, such a delicate moment. Leonard Bernstein was one of the\ngreatest musicians who who had ever lived, not just as a conductor but as a\npianist and as a composer. He was able to educate not just adults but children. Of\ncourse when you watch him, he's always dancing and he can't he can't help\nmoving around the podium and his rhythm is contagious. Karajan believed in beautiful sound, upholstered sound, luxurious sound. So if\nyou hear some of the great recordings of Karajan, it's not always together at\nthese crucial moments but there's a beauty of sound always from beginning to\nend. I mean he had his eyes closed half the\ntime and everything was he was just holding this precious thing all the time\nand crouched over. Carlos Kleiber was all you know, he was holding a magic wand. He was fantasy, pure fantasy. He would make beautiful story lines to pieces\nthat didn't have story lines. He was all about this gesture and these beautiful\nsweeping gestures. I don't believe in jumping around during a Bruckner\nsymphony, I think there's something sacred and it's unnecessary. I do believe\nin having a great time with jazz music and music that swings. You should make\nthe audience want to dance although you shouldn't be a circus act.

There's been a\nlot of talk lately about putting humans on Mars and\neven colonizing the red planet. Is this even possible? And what would that\nsettlement actually look like? [MUSIC PLAYING] Mars is getting a\nlot of attention. NASA's new budget mandates\na 25-year timescale for putting astronauts\nin orbit around Mars. That's exciting. But Elon Musk soon\nfollowed with a rather more audacious announcement. SpaceX plans a spacecraft\ncapable of transporting 100 people at a time to Mars,\nnot to visit, but to settle. And it may be done in\nas little as 10 years. The ultimate aim is for a\ncompletely self-sustaining extraterrestrial colony\nof a million people within several decades. That's some ambition. Here's the lowdown. Musk announced this in\nan hour-long presentation that was almost entirely\nabout the vehicle. First step-- a spaceship is\nlaunched into orbit by a rocket booster. The booster then\nreturns to its launchpad and is loaded with\na giant fuel tank. It relaunches and\ndelivers to the orbiting spaceship enough fuel for the\nfour-month journey to Mars. This is only feasible\nbecause of the reusability of the components. That means many\nreturn trips to Mars, but it also allows\nthe booster to carry the spaceship and the\nfuel in separate launches. As a result, the\nspaceship itself can have a much bigger payload,\ntranslating to 100 passengers, rather than, say, the\nfour astronauts of NASA's proposed Orion module. Now, I could go into\nall of the details. But honestly, you\nshould just listen to or read Musk's announcement. Links below. Is the vehicle\nactually possible? Sure, probably. Whether 10 years is remotely\nfeasible is another matter. That's the lower in the\ncase that, as Musk puts it, things go super well. The plausibility of this may be\ngoverned by whether a Martian colony could really work. Musk says almost\nnothing about that, so let's get into that today. The vision is for a completely\nself-sufficient settlement. Anything less would\ndefeat the main point-- to be a safeguard\nagainst our extinction. It needs to be able to\nthrive, even if Earth is lost. it needs to mine, farm, process,\nand manufacture everything it needs. It also needs to be a place\nthat people might actually want to live. What would that look like? The initial habitats\nare going to be simple. And in fact, the\nfirst landers probably need to bring\nhabitats with them. That 450-ton cargo capacity of\nthe spaceship will help there. These may be inflatable,\nmodular structures, similar to those\nproposed by Mars One, or like the Bigelow\nExpandable Activity Module, BEAM, that's already in use\non the International Space Station. An important advantage of\nprefabricating habitats on Earth is that you can use\nadvanced materials with better radiation shielding. Mars's thin atmosphere\nand lack of magnetic field make shielding\ncritical, especially for a permanent settlement. However, to protect against\nhigh-energy cosmic rays and solar outbursts and from the\nmicrometeorites that also pass easily through Mars's\nthin atmosphere, we really just need\na very thick roof. That means either\nliving underground or building dense shelters\nfrom local material. Becoming Martian mole\npeople may be the way to go. For one thing, Mars\ndoes have lava tubes that could be populated. But with the advent of\nlarge-scale 3D printing, it's possible to\nbuild these structures on a planet's surface. NASA's 3D-printed\nHabitat Challenge produced some\nincredible concepts. Some proposed harvesting\nthe abundant iron and silica from the Martian soil to\nprint a variety of structures. The winner, however\nwas pretty unique-- a 3D-printed dome of ice, under\nwhich pressurized habitats could be built. That's right. We may end up living\nin Martian igloos. The water we'd need for that\nis abundant as ice frozen within the Martian surface. That same water is\nreally what makes this whole endeavor possible. We need it to\ndrink, to grow food. But H2O may also\nbe the best supply of oxygen for, well, breathing. Mars's atmosphere is 96%\nCO2, and the rest equal parts nitrogen and argon. But scrubbed of CO2, that\nnitrogen-argon mix makes a breathable buffer gas that\nwe top up with 20% oxygen. It's been tested on\nmice and crickets, so I guess we're good to go. Growing plants for food requires\nwater and air, but also light. So we need either transparent\ngreenhouse enclosures or artificially-illuminated\nhydroponic farms. Modern hydroponic farms are\nproving vastly more productive and require far less water than\ntheir dirt-based equivalents, so that's a promising direction,\nespecially because it's hard to protect\nagainst radiation with a transparent roof. Also, those plants will\nhelp with oxygen production. Of course, all of\nthis requires energy, and this may be\nthe simplest part. Giant solar arrays stretching\nacross the Martian surface are the obvious answer. The one outstanding technical\nissue is the gravity. Mars's gravity is 0.38\ntimes that of Earth. We know that astronauts\nlose around 2% of bone mass per month in\nzero G. It's surely less on the surface\nof Mars, but we just don't know how serious this\nwould be after many years. To build a sustainable\nmultigenerational civilization, it may be necessary to\nsimulate Earth gravity. This is possible using a\ncentrifuge, a rotating ring that results in the feeling\nof an outward force, a centrifugal force,\nwith respect to the ring. This has been proposed\nfor artificial gravity on long-term space\nmissions, but it's also possible on a planetary surface. It would still involve\na large rotating ring, but with a sloped,\nslightly curved outer wall so that the centrifugal and\ngravitational accelerations work together to give you\nthe right direction of down on that surface. To avoid annoying daily\ncentrifuge visits, perhaps in the long term, we'll will\nbuild entire centrifuge cities levitating on superconducting\nmagnetic rails and rotating once\nevery few minutes. On the other hand, watching\nthe entire sky rotate that fast may be as bad\nfor the stomach as 0.38 G is for the bones. We may want to keep that\nthick roof of rock or ice. Martian cities are\ntechnically doable, and people will\ncertainly want to go. 200,000 signed up for\nthe Mars One program. Really, the feasibility\nof this is more a question of economics. Once we lose the\ninexorable driving force that is Elon Musk,\na Martian settlement will have to be entirely\nself-sufficient or economically productive enough to\njustify continued life support from Earth. Whether that could\nhappen quickly enough is the real question. A lot of what we learn\nabout living on Mars will work elsewhere in\nthe solar system, too. In fact, the proposed\nspacecraft is meant to be a general purpose\nsolar system explorer. Where would you go? Mars will be fun,\nbut we're really holding out for those\nVenusian cloud cities here at Space Time. We want to thank Curiosity\nStream for supporting this episode of Space Time.

Vsauce is doing an amazing\nseries on Mars exploration and colonization. Jake at Vsauce 3\nand I have chatted a lot about what humanity's\nfirst experiences will be like when we go to Mars. Jake's take on this question\nwill be coming out real soon. The link will be right\nhere when it does. Keep your eye out for it. Last week, we talked about the\nincredible, if speculative, possibility that primordial\nblack holes formed in the insanely dense conditions\nright after the Big Bang and that these might\nstill be around today. I want to address\ntwo big questions that you had in the comments. Several of you asked how\nto tell the difference between a primordial black\nhole and a black hole formed when a very massive\nstar ends its life. Well actually, a black\nhole is a black hole is a black hole,\nregardless of how it formed or what it formed from. Even a black hole made entirely\nfrom light, a kugelblitz, is the same thing\nas a black hole formed from regular matter. Black holes exhibit only\nthree properties-- mass, electric charge, and spin. You can learn something about\nthe formation of a black hole from those properties. Mass is one way to identify\na primordial black hole from a stellar black hole. A star's core needs to be more\nmassive than around three times the mass of the sun in order\nto collapse into a black hole. Otherwise, it becomes\na neutron star. However primordial black\nholes don't form from stars and so aren't subject\nto this restriction. They could in\nprinciple be any mass. Also, if we find\nmany PBH's spread through the galaxy and\neven outside the galaxy, their distribution may tell us\nthat it was impossible for them to have been produced by\nmassive stars, which are rare, as far as stars go. A few of you also asked whether\nthe supermassive black holes that we find at the\ncenters of galaxies could be primordial black holes. Well, the answer is yes. But it's really hard\nto say for sure. Those supermassive black holes\nstarted as much smaller seed black holes. Those seeds may have been\nfrom the very first generation of supernovae, near the\nbeginning of the universe. However, they may also have been\nfrom PBH's from an even earlier time. Some scientists like\nthat idea because we see some pretty gigantic\nsupermassive black holes in the early universe,\nand it's quite tricky to explain how they got that\nbig if they grew from only stellar mass black holes. Very large primordial black\nholes may help explain this, but there's no\nevidence for this idea.

{"page": 25, "lesson": 4, "title": "The Cheerios effect", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/8HDeZKFr", "transcript": {"en": "The breakfast table’s probably the last\nplace you'd expect to find cool physics, but there is some awesome science happening right\nhere, and you’ve probably seen lots of times without even realizing it. Ever notice how cereal tends to stick together\nin the middle of the bowl? Or it clumps to the edges. That makes it easy to eat, but why does it\nhappen? We see this same clumpage with other objects\ntoo: paper clips, thumb tacks, even bubbles in a beverage will snap together. Maybe you’ve noticed this, but scientists\ndidn’t fully understand what was going on until 2005, when a pair of mathematicians\ndecided to hit the lab, it hthe kitchen, and hit the books. What they found is cool. I’m super cereal. Check this out. Breakfast cereal is less dense than water\n(and milk is mostly water). It’s buoyant, it weighs less than the milk\nit displaces. That force of buoyancy pushes up on each ring,\nuntil it matches the downward force of gravity. This interaction holds the Cheerios at the\nsurface of the liquid, like little toasty rafts drifting together on top of a sea of\ncereal milk (mmmm cereal milk). It's a really complicated way of saying cereal\nfloats. But look closely at where the cereal meets\nthe liquid. It’s curved up. The same thing happens at the edge of the\ncontainer, thanks to the meniscus effect. Water molecules are sticky – they’re attracted\nto each other, but they’re even more attracted to the edges of your bowl or glass, or to\nthe edge of the cereal itself. That “adhesion” forms a U-shape wherever\nthe liquid meets an edge. A buoyant object will always be pushed up\nthe liquid to the highest point on a meniscus. That’s what makes them stick to the edge,\nand what causes the cheerios to become cheeri-amigos. Any two nearby Os are pushed to a high point\nbetween them, and clumps are pushed towards the overall highest point in the bowl, around\nthe edge. Let’s try something denser. I don’t recommend eating paperclips, but\ntoss them in water and they sink. Place them carefully though, and you can get\nthem to float. They’re too dense to be buoyant, they float\nbecause of surface tension. Water molecules like to stick to each other\nso much, they can behave like a membrane that’s strong enough to hold up tiny things. Let’s try it with these thumbtacks. Like the paper clips, you can see they’re\npushing that membrane dow, just not hard enough to break through. If I place another one nearby, watch what\nhappens. They’re attracted to each other, just like\nthe Cheerios. But the water around each one is curving down. Instead of climbing up the water like cereal\ndid, they fall into each other’s sinkhole. We can mess this scenario up just by adding\nsoap. The chemical properties of soap lower the\nsurface tension of water, so anything relying on surface tension to stay afloat will sink. But buoyant objects don’t rely on surface\ntension, so they continue surfing the meniscus. The first time I did this, I wondered if the\ntacks were being pulled together by static attraction on the plastic coating or something. So I put in just the plastic bit to see. But instead of being pulled toward the tacks,\nsomething strange happened… they repelled each other. The same thing happens with Cheerios and a\npaper clip. That’s because light, floaty objects run\naway from the low points caused by the heavy objects. A buoyant object will always repel something\nheld up by surface tension’s stretchy membrane. Just to be clear, you should never put thumbtacks\nin your cereal. But this is what would happen if you did. All of this made me wonder: What could happen\nif we could reverse the direction of water's meniscus? I coated this glass with a hydrophobic coating\nthat does just that. When I put thumbtacks on top of the water\nin here, they floated to the edge instead of the center. And that buoyant object did the opposite,\nit floated to the middle. So that’s cool and all, but does the physics\nof cereal clumping actually matter in the real world? It does if you’re a tiny insect. Take water striders,. These pond skaters are nature’s Cheerios. They float so well that even a load 15 times\ntheir body weight won’t make them sink. They can even jump on water. Tiny hairs on their legs trap air bubbles\nand increase their buoyancy. They’re basically wearing swim floaties\non their feet. Other aquatic insects like water treaders\nexploit surface tension, just like thumbtacks and paper clips. But they get in trouble when it’s time to\nget out. Gravity is pushing them into the depressions\nunder their feet, but they’ve come up with a clever way to climb the meniscus. A running start doesn’t work. But by arching their bodies and lifting their\nfront and back ends, the bugs curve the water up, and are pulled to the edge just like the\nCheerios were. They’re carried uphill by a physics-powered\nwater escalator. That’s pretty cool. If you can find science like this at breakfast,\nimagine what else you might see the rest of day. Try this for yourself, and see what other\nfloating objects you can get to attract or repel. Leave a comment and let me know what you find. And if you see any cool physics in everyday\nlife I should check out in a future video, let me know.

Schundler", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-does-your-voice-change-as-you-get-older-shaylin-a-schundler", "transcript": {"en": "In the mid-16th century, Italians were captivated by a type \nof male singer whose incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible \nfor adult men. However, this gift came at a high price. To prevent their voices from breaking, these singers had been \ncastrated before puberty, halting the hormonal processes \nthat would deepen their voices. Known as castrati, their light, angelic \nvoices were renowned throughout Europe, until the cruel procedure that created \nthem was outlawed in the 1800s. Though stunting vocal growth can produce \nan extraordinary musical range, naturally developing voices \nare already capable of incredible variety. And as we age, our bodies undergo two\nmajor changes which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice box work,\nand what causes these shifts in speech? The specific sound of a speaking voice is\nthe result of many anatomical variables, but it’s mostly determined by the age \nand health of our vocal cords and the size of our larynxes. The larynx is a complex system \nof muscle and cartilage that supports and moves the vocal cords, or, as they’re more accurately known, \nthe vocal folds. Strung between the thyroid \nand arytenoid cartilages, these two muscles form an elastic curtain\nthat opens and shuts across the trachea, the tube that carries \nair through the throat. The folds are apart when we’re breathing, but when we speak, they slam shut. Our lungs push air \nagainst the closed folds, blowing them open and vibrating\nthe tissue to produce sound. Unlike the deliberate focus required \nfor playing an external instrument, we effortlessly change notes as we speak. By pushing air faster or slower, we change the frequency and amplitude \nof these vibrations, which respectively translate to the pitch \nand volume of our voices. Rapid and small vibrations create \nhigh-pitched, quiet tones, while slow, large vibrations \nproduce deep, bellowing rumbles. Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles \nbetween the cartilages, we can stretch and contract those folds to intuitively play \nour internal instruments. This process is the same from \nyour first words to your last, but as you age, your larynx ages too. During puberty, \nthe first major shift starts, as your voice begins to deepen. This happens when \nyour larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and\nopening up more room for them to vibrate. These longer folds have slower, \nlarger vibrations, which result in a lower baseline pitch. This growth is especially dramatic\nin many males, whose high testosterone levels\nlead first to voice cracks, and then to deeper, more booming voices, and laryngeal protrusions \ncalled Adam’s apples. Another vocal development during puberty occurs when the homogenous tissue\ncovering the folds specializes into three distinct \nfunctional layers: a central muscle, a layer of stiff collagen wrapped \nin stretchy elastin fibers, and an outer layer of mucus membrane. These layers add nuance \nand depth to the voice, giving it a distinct timbre that sets it \napart from its pre-pubescent tones. After puberty, most people’s voices remain\nmore or less the same for about 50 years. But we all use our voices differently, and eventually we experience the\nsymptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia. First, the collagen in our folds stiffens and the surrounding elastin fibers \natrophy and decay. This decreased flexibility increases \nthe pitch of older voices. But for people who have experienced \nthe hormonal effects of menopause, the higher pitch is countered\nand outweighed by swollen vocal folds. The folds' increased mass slows their\nvibrations, resulting in deeper voices. All these symptoms are further complicated by having fewer healthy \nlaryngeal nerve endings, which reduces precise muscle control \nand causes breathy or rough voices. Ultimately, these anatomical changes \nare just a few of the factors that can affect your voice.

From existing oral tradition, audiences knew the tales \nof the long siege, the epic duels outside the city walls, and the cunning trick \nthat finally won the war. In the end, the magnificent\ncity was burned to the ground, never to rise again. But had it ever existed? By the time the field of archaeology \nbegan to take shape in the 19th century, many were skeptical,\nconsidering the epic to be pure fiction, a founding myth imagining \na bygone heroic era. But some scholars believed that behind the superhuman feats \nand divine miracles there must have been a grain \nof historical truth - a war that was really fought, and a place where it happened. Frank Calvert was one such believer. He had spent his youth traveling \nand learning about ancient civilizations before accompanying his brother Frederick on a diplomatic mission to the northwest\nAnatolian region of Çanakkale. It was here that Homer described \nthe Greek encampment at the mouth of the Scamander river. And it was here that fate brought Frank \ninto contact with a journalist and geologist \nnamed Charles Maclaren. Locals and travelers had long speculated that Troy might’ve stood on one \nof the surrounding hilltops. But Maclaren had been one of the first to publish a detailed topographical \nstudy of the area. He believed he had found the site – a 32-meter mound known \nby the name Hisarlık, derived from the Turkish word \nfor “fortress.” Soon after meeting with him in 1847, the Calverts bought \n2,000 acres of farmland that included part of the hill. Before they could explore any further, the Crimean War broke out and forestalled their archaeological \nambitions for several years. After the war’s end, Frank Calvert began to survey the site, but lacked the funds \nfor a full excavation. This was where the wealthy \nGerman businessman and amateur archaeologist \nHeinrich Schliemann came in. At Calvert’s invitation, Schliemann visited the grounds in 1868, \nand decided to excavate. Eager to find the ancient city, Schliemann tore massive trenches \nall the way to the base of the hill. There, he uncovered a hoard \nof precious artifacts, jewelry, and metalwork, including two diadems \nand a copper shield. Schliemann took full credit \nfor the discovery, announcing that he had found Troy and the treasure of its king Priam. But the real treasure was elsewhere. When later archaeologists \nstudied the site, they realized that the mound consisted \nof no less than nine cities, each built atop the ruins of the last. The layer Schliemann had uncovered \ndated back to the Mycenaean Age, more than 1,000 years too early \nfor Homer. But inside the mound was indeed evidence for a city that had thrived \nduring the Bronze Age, with charred stone, broken arrowheads, and damaged human skeletons \nsuggesting a violent end. It was Troy VII, \ncontained in the middle layers and now ravaged for a second time \nby Schliemann’s careless excavation. The settlement, \nspanning some 200,000 square meters and home to as many as 10,000 people, thrived until around 1180 BCE. Its position at the southern entrance \nof the Dardanelles strait would’ve made a formidable strategic \nlocation for both defense and trade. Most importantly, there are the remains \nof a massive fortification wall – perhaps the very same one from which Priam and Hector \nonce watched the Greeks approach. Of course, it’s difficult to be certain that these ruins are the true remains \nof ancient Troy, and scholars still dispute whether the Trojan War \nas described by Homer ever happened. Yet the evidence is strong enough that UNESCO has labelled Hisarlık\nthe archeological site of Troy. Regardless of its identity, thanks to persistence, a bit of faith, and a lot of research, archaeologists are bringing \nthe long-buried secrets of an ancient, lost city to light."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "When was Homer’s Iliad first written down?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "6th century BCE"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2nd century CE"}, {"label": "C", "text": "8th century BCE"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4th century BCE"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Troy was discovered in the mound of Hisarlık, a name derived from the Turkish word for _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Fortress"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Mountain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Citadel"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Wall"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Who eventually excavated the site of Troy?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Frank Calvert"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Heinrich Schliemann"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Charles Maclaren"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Frederick Calvert"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Troy _______ is most closely associated with the Iliad.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "7"}, {"label": "B", "text": "2"}, {"label": "C", "text": "5"}, {"label": "D", "text": "4"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "What key evidence did archaeologists use to identify the site?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "A wooden horse"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gold jewelry"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The remains of King Priam"}, {"label": "D", "text": "A fortification wall"}], "correct_option": "D"}]}

From synthetic constructs\nthat resemble biological materials, to computational methods\nthat emulate neural processes, nature is driving design. Design is also driving nature. In realms of genetics, regenerative\nmedicine and synthetic biology, designers are growing novel technologies, not foreseen or anticipated by nature. Bionics explores the interplay\nbetween biology and design. As you can see, my legs are bionic. Today, I will tell human stories\nof bionic integration; how electromechanics attached\nto the body, and implanted inside the body are beginning to bridge the gap\nbetween disability and ability, between human limitation\nand human potential. Bionics has defined my physicality. In 1982, both of my legs were amputated due to tissue damage from frostbite, incurred during\na mountain-climbing accident. At that time, I didn't\nview my body as broken. I reasoned that a human being\ncan never be \"broken.\" Technology is broken. Technology is inadequate. This simple but powerful idea\nwas a call to arms, to advance technology\nfor the elimination of my own disability, and ultimately, the disability of others. I began by developing specialized limbs that allowed me to return\nto the vertical world of rock and ice climbing. I quickly realized that the artificial\npart of my body is malleable; able to take on any form, any function -- a blank slate for which to create, perhaps, structures that could extend\nbeyond biological capability. I made my height adjustable. I could be as short as five feet\nor as tall as I'd like. (Laughter) So when I was feeling bad about myself, insecure, I would jack my height up. (Laughter) But when I was feeling\nconfident and suave, I would knock my height down a notch,\njust to give the competition a chance. (Laughter) (Applause) Narrow-edged feet allowed me\nto climb steep rock fissures, where the human foot cannot penetrate, and spiked feet enabled me\nto climb vertical ice walls, without ever experiencing\nmuscle leg fatigue. Through technological innovation, I returned to my sport,\nstronger and better. Technology had eliminated my disability, and allowed me a new climbing prowess. As a young man, I imagined a future world\nwhere technology so advanced could rid the world of disability, a world in which neural\nimplants would allow the visually impaired to see. A world in which the paralyzed\ncould walk, via body exoskeletons. Sadly, because of\ndeficiencies in technology, disability is rampant in the world. This gentleman is missing three limbs. As a testimony to current technology,\nhe is out of the wheelchair, but we need to do a better job in bionics,\nto allow, one day, full rehabilitation for a person with this level of injury. At the MIT Media Lab, we've established\nthe Center for Extreme Bionics. The mission of the center\nis to put forth fundamental science and technological capability that will allow the biomechatronic\nand regenerative repair of humans, across a broad range\nof brain and body disabilities. Today, I'm going to tell you\nhow my legs function, how they work, as a case in point for this center. Now, I made sure to shave\nmy legs last night, because I knew I'd be showing them off. (Laughter) Bionics entails the engineering\nof extreme interfaces. There's three extreme\ninterfaces in my bionic limbs: mechanical, how my limbs\nare attached to my biological body; dynamic, how they move\nlike flesh and bone; and electrical, how they communicate\nwith my nervous system. I'll begin with mechanical interface. In the area of design,\nwe still do not understand how to attach devices\nto the body mechanically. It's extraordinary to me\nthat in this day and age, one of the most mature,\noldest technologies in the human timeline, the shoe,\nstill gives us blisters. How can this be? We have no idea how to attach\nthings to our bodies. This is the beautifully\nlyrical design work of Professor Neri Oxman\nat the MIT Media Lab, showing spatially varying\nexoskeletal impedances, shown here by color variation\nin this 3D-printed model. Imagine a future where clothing\nis stiff and soft where you need it, when you need it, for optimal\nsupport and flexibility, without ever causing discomfort. My bionic limbs are attached\nto my biological body via synthetic skins\nwith stiffness variations, that mirror my underlying\ntissue biomechanics. To achieve that mirroring, we first\ndeveloped a mathematical model of my biological limb. To that end, we used\nimaging tools such as MRI, to look inside my body, to figure out the geometries\nand locations of various tissues. We also took robotic tools -- here's a 14-actuator circle\nthat goes around the biological limb. The actuators come in,\nfind the surface of the limb, measure its unloaded shape, and then they push on the tissues to measure tissue compliances\nat each anatomical point. We combine these imaging and robotic data to build a mathematical description\nof my biological limb, shown on the left. You see a bunch of points, or nodes? At each node, there's a color\nthat represents tissue compliance. We then do a mathematical transformation\nto the design of the synthetic skin, shown on the right. And we've discovered optimality is: where the body is stiff,\nthe synthetic skin should be soft, where the body is soft,\nthe synthetic skin is stiff, and this mirroring occurs\nacross all tissue compliances. With this framework,\nwe've produced bionic limbs that are the most comfortable\nlimbs I've ever worn. Clearly, in the future, our clothing,\nour shoes, our braces, our prostheses, will no longer be designed\nand manufactured using artisan strategies, but rather, data-driven\nquantitative frameworks. In that future, our shoes\nwill no longer give us blisters. We're also embedding\nsensing and smart materials into the synthetic skins. This is a material developed\nby SRI International, California. Under electrostatic effect,\nit changes stiffness. So under zero voltage,\nthe material is compliant, it's floppy like paper. Then the button's pushed,\na voltage is applied, and it becomes stiff as a board. (Tapping sounds) We embed this material\ninto the synthetic skin that attaches my bionic limb\nto my biological body. When I walk here, it's no voltage. My interface is soft and compliant. The button's pushed,\nvoltage is applied, and it stiffens, offering me a greater maneuverability\nover the bionic limb. We're also building exoskeletons. This exoskeleton becomes stiff and soft in just the right areas\nof the running cycle, to protect the biological joints\nfrom high impacts and degradation. In the future, we'll all\nbe wearing exoskeletons in common activities, such as running. Next, dynamic interface. How do my bionic limbs\nmove like flesh and bone? At my MIT lab, we study how humans\nwith normal physiologies stand, walk and run. What are the muscles doing, and how are they controlled\nby the spinal cord? This basic science\nmotivates what we build. We're building bionic ankles,\nknees and hips. We're building body parts\nfrom the ground up. The bionic limbs that I'm wearing\nare called BiOMs. They've been fitted\nto nearly 1,000 patients, 400 of which have been\nwounded U.S. soldiers. How does it work? At heel strike, under computer control, the system controls stiffness, to attenuate the shock\nof the limb hitting the ground. Then at mid-stance, the bionic limb\noutputs high torques and powers to lift the person\ninto the walking stride, comparable to how muscles\nwork in the calf region. This bionic propulsion is very important\nclinically to patients. So on the left, you see\nthe bionic device worn by a lady, on the right, a passive device\nworn by the same lady, that fails to emulate\nnormal muscle function, enabling her to do something\neveryone should be able to do: go up and down their steps at home. Bionics also allows\nfor extraordinary athletic feats. Here's a gentleman running\nup a rocky pathway. This is Steve Martin --\nnot the comedian -- who lost his legs in a bomb blast\nin Afghanistan. We're also building exoskeletal\nstructures using these same principles, that wrap around the biological limb. This gentleman does not have\nany leg condition, any disability. He has a normal physiology, so these exoskeletons are applying\nmuscle-like torques and powers, so that his own muscles need not\napply those torques and powers. This is the first exoskeleton in history\nthat actually augments human walking. It significantly reduces metabolic cost. It's so profound in its augmentation, that when a normal, healthy person\nwears the device for 40 minutes and then takes it off, their own biological legs feel\nridiculously heavy and awkward. We're beginning the age in which\nmachines attached to our bodies will make us stronger\nand faster and more efficient. Moving on to electrical interface: How do my bionic limbs communicate\nwith my nervous system? Across my residual limb are electrodes that measure the electrical\npulse of my muscles. That's communicated to the bionic limb, so when I think about moving\nmy phantom limb, the robot tracks those movement desires. This diagram shows fundamentally\nhow the bionic limb is controlled. So we model the missing biological limb, and we've discovered\nwhat reflexes occurred, how the reflexes of the spinal cord\nare controlling the muscles. And that capability is embedded\nin the chips of the bionic limb. What we've done, then, is we modulate\nthe sensitivity of the reflex, the modeled spinal reflex,\nwith the neural signal, so when I relax my muscles\nin my residual limb, I get very little torque and power, but the more I fire my muscles,\nthe more torque I get, and I can even run. And that was the first demonstration\nof a running gait under neural command. Feels great. (Applause) We want to go a step further. We want to actually close the loop between the human\nand the bionic external limb. We're doing experiments where we're growing nerves,\ntransected nerves, through channels, or micro-channel arrays. On the other side of the channel, the nerve then attaches to cells, skin cells and muscle cells. In the motor channels, we can sense\nhow the person wishes to move. That can be sent out wirelessly\nto the bionic limb, then [sensory information]\non the bionic limb can be converted to stimulations\nin adjacent channels, sensory channels. So when this is fully developed\nand for human use, persons like myself will not only have synthetic limbs that move\nlike flesh and bone, but actually feel like flesh and bone. This video shows Lisa Mallette, shortly after being fitted\nwith two bionic limbs. Indeed, bionics is making\na profound difference in people's lives. (Video) Lisa Mallette: Oh my God. LM: Oh my God, I can't believe it! (Video) (Laughter) LM: It's just like I've got a real leg! Woman: Now, don't start running. Man: Now turn around,\nand do the same thing walking up, but get on your heel to toe, like you\nwould normally just walk on level ground. Try to walk right up the hill. LM: Oh my God. Man: Is it pushing you up? LM: Yes! I'm not even --\nI can't even describe it. Man: It's pushing you right up. Hugh Herr: Next week,\nI'm visiting the Center -- Thank you. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you. Next week I'm visiting the Center\nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services, and I'm going to try to convince CMS to grant appropriate\ncode language and pricing, so this technology can be made available\nto the patients that need it. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) It's not well appreciated,\nbut over half of the world's population suffers from some form of cognitive,\nemotional, sensory or motor condition, and because of poor technology,\ntoo often, conditions result in disability and a poorer quality of life. Basic levels of physiological function\nshould be a part of our human rights. Every person should have the right\nto live life without disability if they so choose -- the right to live life\nwithout severe depression; the right to see a loved one,\nin the case of seeing-impaired; or the right to walk or to dance, in the case of limb paralysis\nor limb amputation. As a society, we can\nachieve these human rights, if we accept the proposition\nthat humans are not disabled. A person can never be broken. Our built environment, our technologies, are broken and disabled. We the people need not\naccept our limitations, but can transcend disability\nthrough technological innovation. Indeed, through fundamental advances\nin bionics in this century, we will set the technological foundation\nfor an enhanced human experience, and we will end disability. I'd like to finish up\nwith one more story, a beautiful story. The story of Adrianne Haslet-Davis. Adrianne lost her left leg\nin the Boston terrorist attack. I met Adrianne when this photo was taken,\nat Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital. Adrianne is a dancer, a ballroom dancer. Adrianne breathes and lives dance. It is her expression. It is her art form. Naturally, when she lost her limb\nin the Boston terrorist attack, she wanted to return to the dance floor. After meeting her\nand driving home in my car, I thought, I'm an MIT professor.\nI have resources. Let's build her a bionic limb, to enable her to go back\nto her life of dance. I brought in MIT scientists\nwith expertise in prosthetics, robotics, machine learning\nand biomechanics, and over a 200-day research period,\nwe studied dance. We brought in dancers\nwith biological limbs, and we studied how they move, what forces they apply on the dance floor, and we took those data, and we put forth\nfundamental principles of dance, reflexive dance capability, and we embedded that intelligence\ninto the bionic limb. Bionics is not only about making\npeople stronger and faster. Our expression, our humanity\ncan be embedded into electromechanics. It was 3.5 seconds between the bomb blasts\nin the Boston terrorist attack. In 3.5 seconds, the criminals and cowards\ntook Adrianne off the dance floor. In 200 days, we put her back. We will not be intimidated, brought down,\ndiminished, conquered or stopped by acts of violence. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, please allow me\nto introduce Adrianne Haslet-Davis, her first performance since the attack. She's dancing with Christian Lightner.

{"page": 25, "lesson": 8, "title": "Why the ocean is getting louder", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/Bg7RJ2og", "transcript": {"en": "This is me. I'm about to go scuba diving for the first time ever. I went in expecting muffled peace and quiet. I mean, one of the earliest documentaries\non underwater life was literally called “The Silent World”. “They roamed deep under the Mediterranean,\nthe Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean, in a mysterious realm, a silent world.” But as soon as I got down a few yards, I couldn't\nhelp but notice sound all around me. It was hard to tell what direction it was\ncoming from, or how far away it was. It was coming from boats above me. As far as I can tell, the Earth’s water\nis not as quiet as I thought. I’ve been binging this podcast all about\nsound, and they've been looking into this too \"From DeFacto Sound, you’re listening to Twenty Thousand Hertz: The stories behind the\nworld’s most recognizable and interesting sounds. I’m Dallas Taylor.\" So Dallas — life underwater can be pretty\nloud, right? It can! Just listen to these toadfish— they oscillate\ntheir swim bladders to make sounds that are loud enough to keep houseboat residents in\nSausalito, California up at night. Or these Barred Grunt fish, that make a grinding\nsound with the teeth in their gullet. Or these snapping shrimp — they produce a sound by creating tiny popping bubbles with their claws. It’s been measured at 200 decibels. That’s louder than a gunshot. Light doesn’t penetrate very deep in water,\nso a lot of ocean life has evolved to use sound as its primary sense. Because water particles are more densely packed\ntogether than air, sound travels farther and faster in water. That makes it an efficient medium of communication\nat any depth or time of day. “Let's say we had 440, like the middle\nkey of your piano, or whatever.” That’s John Hildebrand, he’s a professor\nat the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He's an expert in the field of underwater\nsound and how it’s used by and how it affects marine mammals. “If you looked at the wavelength of that\nsound in air, that note, the 440 note, would be a little bit less than a meter long. In water, it's more like several meters\nlong.” What that means is that noise travels about\nfour times faster and farther in water than it does in air. In an experiment in 1991, sound emitted from\nHeard Island was picked up at 16 sites in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. It turns out that one of the most common noises\nin the entire ocean that can be picked up almost anywhere these days, sounds like this: It's the sound of boats. Noise from ship traffic has doubled every\ndecade since the 1960s. “Basically, anywhere you go, the ambient\nnoise in the ocean is dominated by anthropogenic sound.” “Let's say I made a measurement 30 years\nago and now if I went to the same place and made the same measurement, it would be 10\ndBs or more higher sound level than what I measured when I started my career. That’s spooky.” That’s a huge problem for animals that use\nsound as their primary sense. Just listen to this audio of how noise from\na passing boat totally drowns out dolphin communication. But arguably the worst culprit of underwater\nsound pollution is a process that sounds like this: This is seismic surveying. It’s a process that allows companies to\nlocate spots on the ocean floor where they can drill for fossil fuels. Boats with about 30-40 airguns that all go\noff at once will move back and forth over large parts of the ocean. Bubbles from the horns expand and contract\ntypically every 10 seconds, creating a huge amount of acoustic energy that maps geological\nstructures deep in the ocean floor. And it’s about as loud as a jet at takeoff. This can go on for weeks at a time. A study of seismic survey noise between 1999\nand 2009 found that airgun sounds were recorded almost 2500 miles away from the survey ship\nitself. At some locations, they were recorded on 80\npercent of days for over a year. And that changes how animals behave. A study by the Institute of Marine Science\nat the University of North Carolina found that reef fish abundance decreased by 78 percent\nduring seismic surveying. This is what the reef looked like before seismic\nsurveying in the area. And this is what it looked like after. “Seismic surveying is a constroversial topic at the\ncoast and new research is only adding to the conversation. “One of those impacted is local fisherman\nJack Cox. He’s seen firsthand the impact seismic\nsurveying has on fish.” “It does something, that — we just don’t catch fish. For animals like whales — who rely on complex\nsound communication systems to socialize, find food, and mate — that poses a huge\nproblem. If you watch this heat map from a study of\nendangered North Atlantic right whales, you can see that shipping paths near Boston squeeze\nthe whales into a tiny space where communication is possible — it's about a third of what\nit was without the ships. Susan Parks, a biology professor at Syracuse,\nrecorded right whale sounds throughout the early 2000s. And when she compared her audio to some that had\nbeen recorded in 1956, she noticed that the older sounds were much deeper than her high-pitched\nrecordings. It turns out that the whales had started calling\nat higher and higher frequencies in order to hear each other over the hum of ship noise. Apart from habitat displacement and communication\nchanges, there’s also evidence that boat noise simply stresses these whales out. After the September 11th attacks, researchers\nin Canada’s Bay of Fundy compared underwater noise levels during a period of reduced ship\ntraffic to the stress-related hormone levels in the right whale population. They discovered a 6 decibel noise decrease\nin the bay after 9/11, which correlated to lower baseline levels of stress related hormones. Effects like this go all the way down the\nfood chain. A 2017 study found that there were two to\nthree times more dead zooplankton after after a day of blasts from a single airgun. And the larvae of krill, which whales rely\non for food, were totally destroyed. In April 2017, Donald Trump signed an executive\norder to open offshore drilling in the Atlantic. It directed the Interior Department to consider\nallowing seismic exploration by 5 companies that had been blocked under the Obama administration. It’s getting widespread pushback in Congress\n— there’s a bipartisan House bill and Democrat-led Senate bill to ban seismic testing\n— but if those authorizations go through, companies could be conducting seismic testing\nin the Atlantic by Fall 2017. So… is there any good news? Yes, there is. In 2014, the International Maritime Organization\nadopted guidelines for reducing commercial ship noise levels with things like noise-muffling\npropellers and insulated engines — though they’re not mandatory yet. A year later, the US Navy agreed to limit\nsonar testing — which has been linked to whales stranding themselves on beaches in\nhabitats near Southern California and Hawaii — following a lawsuit from environmental\ngroups. And in June 2016, the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administration laid out an Ocean Noise Strategy Roadmap. It’s the start of a 10-year plan to assess\nthe human impact on underwater sound and the measures required to reduce it. Seismic surveys can work better, too. Norway has started multi-client surveys, so\nthat seismic data from a particular area is only collected once. US authorities are considering a similar process. The ocean is huge. We’ve explored less than 5 percent of it\nso far. So it’s easy to forget that what we do on\nthe surface affects everything down below. But like plastic, chemicals, and waste, noise\npollutes our oceans. Understanding that is key to doing our part\nto protect it. Thank you so much for watching, we loved doing\nthis collaboration with Twenty Thousand Hertz. They create super highly produced podcasts that tell stories all about sound.

Like your grandma’s\nhouse, your first dog, or . . . the smell of rain. Storm winds carry an orchestra of separate\nsmells, but the earthy odor that precedes a storm can be traced to three chemical sources. Before a thunderstorm, you’re probably smelling\nozone, which interestingly gets its name from the Greek word meaning “to smell”. The\nelectrical charge of lightning high up in approaching storm clouds splits oxygen gas\ninto separate atoms, some of those can reform into ozone. It’s swept ahead of the advancing\nstorm by windy downdrafts, and down to your nose level.

Petrichor gets half\nits name from the ethereal essence that flowed through the veins of Greek gods and half from\nthe stones of the Earth, which pretty much captures both its science, and the powerful\nfeels I get when I smell it. When decomposed organic material is blown\nairborne from dry soil, it lands on dirt or rocks, where it’s joined by minerals and\nthe whole mixture is cooked into a magical medley of molecules. Falling raindrops then\nsend those chemicals airborne right into your nostalgic nostrils. When there’s no rain around, those same\nchemicals remain in the soil, where they signal plants to halt their roots from growing or\nprevent seeds from sprouting when there’s no water to drink. Petrichor: it’s for the\nplant that’s tired of waiting . . . to germinate. Bacteria in the soil also contribute to petrichor\nby releasing a chemical called geosmin, that's the same compound that gives beets their earthy\nflavor. There’s other purposes for petrichor besides\nshowering us with emotion. It thought to attract camels to desert oases, who slurp up and transport\nthe soil bacteria across the sands. Petrichor that’s washed into rivers and lakes also\nseems to signal fish that it’s time to spawn. There’s nothing like a rainstorm to spark\na little romance, I guess. So next time you smell a summer storm a-coming,\ntake a minute to think about what that rock over there is trying to tell you. Stay curious. And smell ya later. Why are sharks so scary? Bloodthirsty beasts\njust waiting out there in the waves to feast on human flesh. if only we could get rid of\nthese guys our vacations would be so much safer, nothing to worry about while we're\nsurfing and frolicking out there in the ocean. Except that's not the case.

{"page": 25, "lesson": 10, "title": "Self-esteem", "category": "Psychology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/Mywo8YxC", "transcript": {"en": "Liking ourselves, having high self-esteem as we tend to put it. Is crucial to any feeling of well-being. What's odd then is just how unpredictable the allocation of esteem often turns out to be. There are people with modest jobs unspectacular bodies and unglamorous friends confidently nevertheless, they claim to buoyant levels of self-esteem. They seem to like themselves. Despite the absence of any vigorous signs of approval from the world at large. And then there are others. For who no amount of achievement prestige and financial security ever seems to do the trick. They anxiously challenge despise and critique themselves. Always feeling that they have under performed Never quite trusting that they really deserve to exist. Having sound levels of self-esteem Ultimately appears to have precious little to do with hitting any verifiable benchmarks . It seems connected up with a stranger. More internal, more subjective kind of logic. With factors immune to stand at notions of achievement. Three factors stand out in particular. Firstly The single greatest determinative of how much you will esteem yourself is how you compare with your same-sex parent. Whether you've achieved more or less than mom or dad. Rather brutally it seems that comfortable levels of self esteem are only available to those who've managed to outpace their same-sex parent. Those from a poor backround have a big unwitting advantage here. You might only be driving a beaten-up old taxi around Manhattan and living in one room in Harlem, but if your same-sex parent was a subsitence farmer from Easten Burkina Faso you will at times feel princely nevertheless. Similarly yet more darkly you might have grown up in ostensibly privilege circumstances, but if you same-sex parent made a few hundred milion and you're only managing to pull in a midlle-class salary you're liable never quite to shake of haunting feeling that you're a disgrace Secondly We don't feel inadequate in relation to everyone who has more than US only those who we'we come to see as belonging to another crucial determinative self-esteem. Our peere group. By this we mean the people who we're educated with us, who are around our age and who live in our part of the world. These people matter infinitely more to our sense of well-being than the population at large. It's a piece of extreme bad luck and matter for particular commiseration and assistance if ever on peer group produces someone who starts a bilion dollar company or god forbid ends up runnin the country. Everytime someone we went to school with does better than us a small part of us will die we should therefore take immense care to attend very ordinary schools and after graduation \nto throw all invitations to reunions straight in the trash Thirdly A lot depends on what kind of affection we were the recipients of in childhood in particular how many conditions our love came attached with. Some of us had parets who only knew how to give out the conditional kind of love. It was all about the grades and the school reports. We therefore grow up of course to be high achievers but it's not so easy, running around your whole life long desperate to put out the raging fires of self-hatred striving to impress everyone you meet in search of an unsatisfied desire for a parental approval you never knew. But others the blessed ones who've know unconditional love, from the start will be ok just to be, they won't have to do quite so much pushing they have an inner basic buoyancy quaranteed by the knowledge that they once mattered immeasurably A big reversal like being fired will be unpleasant it won't necessarily have to be a tragedy. Knowing about the odd internal origins of self-esteem is crucial because of how often we pursue goals in the belief that success will at last give us the keys to feeling good about ourselves. It seem the truth is slightly darker you might ostensibly be doing very well at work but if your dad was a big shot or your school buddy became president or your parents didn't tank you up with the right unconditional sort of love no amount of striving, goalscoring and medal-winning is ever really gonna do it. This changes where we should imagine our challenges\nlie feeling good about ourselves isn't ultimately something we can bring about trough professional or economic achievements alone. In huge part it's going to be about coming to terms with ourselves. The result of understanding our past and the dynamics of shame, conditionality and humiliation that might lie there it turns out that high self-esteem seems largely to be apprised of psychology rather than the fruit of anything we might achieve out in the world in relation to the economy."}, "multiple-choice": []}

Was Rome’s first emperor a visionary leader who guaranteed \nhis civilization’s place in history or a tyrant who destroyed its core values? Find out in History versus Augustus. Order, order. The defendant today is Gaius Octavius? Gaius Julius Caesar/Augustus... Do we have the wrong guy? No, your Honor. Gaius Octavius, born in 63 BCE, \nwas the grand-nephew of Julius Caesar. He became Gaius Julius Caesar upon being named his great-uncle’s \nadoptive son and heir. And he gained the title Augustus in 27 BCE when the Senate granted \nhim additional honors. You mean when he established \nsole authority and became emperor of Rome. Is that bad? Didn’t every place have some king \nor emperor back then? Actually, your Honor, the Roman people had overthrown \ntheir kings centuries before to establish a republic, a government meant to serve the people,\nnot the privilege of a ruling family. And it was Octavius \nwho destroyed this tradition. Octavius was a model public servant. At 16, he was elected \nto the College of Pontiffs that supervised religious worship. He fought for Rome in Hispania \nalongside his great-uncle Caesar and took up the responsibility \nof avenging Caesar’s death when the corrupt oligarchs in the Senate\nbetrayed and murdered him. Caesar had been a power-hungry tyrant \nwho tried to make himself a king while consorting with \nhis Egyptian queen Cleopatra. After his death, Octavius joined his general Mark Antony in starting a civil war \nthat tore Rome apart, then stabbed his ally in the back \nto increase his own power. Antony was a fool. He waged a disastrous campaign in Parthia and plotted to turn Roman territories into personal kingdoms \nfor himself and Cleopatra. Isn’t that what Caesar \nhad been accused of? Well... So Octavius destroyed Antony \nfor trying to become a king and then became one himself? That’s right. You can see the megalomania even in \nhis adopted title – \"The Illustrious One.\" That was a religious honorific. And Augustus didn’t seek power \nfor his own sake. As winner of the civil war \nand commander of the most troops, it was his duty to restore \nlaw and order to Rome so that other factions \ndidn’t continue fighting. He didn’t restore the law -\nhe made it subordinate to him! Not true. Augustus worked to restore \nthe Senate’s prestige, improved food security \nfor the lower classes, and relinquished control of \nthe army when he resigned his consul post. Mere optics. He used his military influence \nand personal wealth to stack the Senate in his favor, while retaining the powers of a tribune and the right to celebrate \nmilitary triumphs. He kept control of provinces \nwith the most legions. And if that wasn’t enough, he assumed the consul position \ntwice more to promote his grandchildren. He was clearly trying \nto establish a dynasty. But what did he do with all that power? Glad you asked, your Honor. Augustus’s accomplishments \nwere almost too many to name. He established consistent \ntaxation for all provinces, ending private exploitation \nby local tax officials. He personally financed a network of roads\nand employed couriers so news and troops could travel\neasily throughout the realm. And it was under Augustus that many of Rome’s famous \npublic buildings were constructed. The writers of the time were nearly \nunanimous in praising his rule. Did the writers have any other choice? Augustus exiled plenty of people \non vague charges, including Ovid, \none of Rome’s greatest poets. And you forgot to mention the intrusive \nlaws regarding citizens’ personal lives – punishing adultery, restricting marriage \nbetween social classes, even penalties for remaining unmarried. He was trying to improve the citizenry\nand instill discipline. And he succeeded. His legacy speaks for itself: 40 years of internal stability, a professional army that expanded \nRome’s frontiers in all directions, and a government still remembered \nas a model of civic virtue. His legacy was an empire that would go on to wage endless \nconquest until it collapsed, and a tradition of military autocracy. Any time a dictator in a general’s uniform\ncommits atrocities while claiming to act on behalf \nof \"the people,\" we have Augustus Caesar to thank. So you’re saying Augustus \nwas a good emperor, and you’re saying there’s no such thing? We’re used to celebrating \nhistorical leaders for their achievements and victories. But to ask whether an individual should \nhave such power in the first place is to put history itself on trial."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "What was the childhood name of Augustus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Gaius Julius Caesar"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Gaius Octavius"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Augustus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mark Antony"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What system of government did Rome have before Augustus?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Monarchy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Oligarchy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Republic"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Democracy"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Who was Augustus’s major ally early on in the civil war?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Cleopatra"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The College of Pontiffs"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The Senate"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mark Antony"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The title \"Augustus\" translates loosely to _________.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "\"The Illustrious One\""}, {"label": "B", "text": "\"The Powerful One\""}, {"label": "C", "text": "\"The Beautiful One\""}, {"label": "D", "text": "\"The Fearsome One\""}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Which famous Roman poet was exiled on vague charges during Augustus’s rule?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Horace"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ovid"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Virgil"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Propertius"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 25, "lesson": 12, "title": "Where babies in movies come from", "category": "The Arts", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/OFzMWk2Q", "transcript": {"en": "There’s a pretty awesome scene in The Fate\nof the Furious where Jason Statham fights a bunch of armed\nmercenaries on an airplane while holding an adorable baby in a carrier. I've always wondered how babies end up in\nsituations like this. What kind of hoops do you have to jump through\nto cast babies in Hollywood? You were gonna shoot a baby? You sick bastard. Besides babysitting, delivering newspapers,\nand, uh, wreath making, show business is the only industry that can\nlegally employ children under the age of 14 In fact, they’ve been in movies almost since\nthe birth of cinema. I hate myself so much. Casting a baby isn’t as simple as casting\na grown up actor though, For one: they don’t have to get their shift\nat Starbucks covered to go to an audition, but mostly because there are some special\nrules producers have to follow when casting an infant. For example, in California, babies can only\nbe on set for two consecutive hours per day, with actual work not exceeding 20 minutes\n“under any circumstances.” The state’s child labor laws also require\nthat babies be at least 15 days old to be eligible for\na work permit. Which is good news for babies who can\njust chill during their literal first days on earth, but not so good for productions that have\nscenes with newborns because the thing is, if you’ve ever seen\na baby that’s two weeks old, you know that they don’t exactly look like\na newborn anymore. In order to get past this hurdle, productions\noften try to cast preemies, who look newborn even when they’re the required\nminimum of 15 days old, and in a lot of places outside of California\nthat’s perfectly legal. In 16 states there are actually zero regulations\nregarding minimum age for baby employment in films and many other states have laws that are pretty\nlax. In New Jersey for example a month-old baby\ncan work five hours a day, five days a week and in Louisiana they can be employed six\nhours a day, six days a week. That’s more hours than I worked when I\nbagged groceries after I graduated college and no I DO NOT want to talk about it. Most states also do nothing to protect the\nmoney that babies make. Only a few places follow the Coogan Law, which requires that child actors be set up\nwith a blocked trust account to protect their earnings. The law is named after Jackie Coogan, an early 20th century child actor who was\nin a number of Charlie Chaplin films including the American classic The Kid. As a child actor he reportedly earned as much\nas $4 million, but his parents squandered all his money\nby the time he became an adult. Because of his s***ty parents, moms and dads\nin these states are required to set aside 15 persent of their\nminor’s income in a Coogan account, which the child can access at the age of 18. Shooting with babies can be complicated,\nbut the film industry has a way of working around it. I would say 90 to 95 percent of jobs for babies\nand toddlers are exclusive to twins and triplets because two babies can play one character. So there's two advantages there. Number one you can have them both come to\nset at the same time. So if Twin A gets fussy they can call in Twin\nB and they can use the babies back and forth. And the other thing is sometimes production\nwill split their call times so they'll have one baby come in let's say\nat 9:00 in the morning have another baby come in at 2:00 in the afternoon. And so it extends their day. Also half of all twins and almost all triplets\nare born premature, so productions get more working hours and\nthey look newborn. Sean Penn had a different solution. He directed a movie that nobody saw called\nThe Last Face where they put out a casting call for a one\nday old baby. Since they were shooting in South Africa,\nwhere you can cast minors with the permission of the Department of Labour, it was totally legal. Babies in show biz probably rake in big bucks\nright? Unfortunately… not. Babies obviously can’t talk, so they are usually classified as an “under\n5”, a term that refers to an actor with less than\nfive lines. It's interesting because you can have a baby\nwho is a recurring character on a TV show and has a name that the public can relate\nto. But a lot of those babies are only getting\npaid between 200 and 300 dollars a day. So babies don’t really make a ton of money. And casting them sounds like kind of a nightmare\n-- are there any other options? Cut to American Sniper: Not all of them are as fake as this one, but plenty of productions resort to using\nfake babies, at least for part of the shoot. Hey! Tend to my daughter please, right now! It is quite common that you know they’ll\nuse fake babies for the far away scenes and then you know they'll\nhire a baby when they need a close up shot or a\nface shot. And there are robot babies out there that\nlook pretty convincing. And by convincing I mean terrifying. I never thought I’d use a Mandy Moore clip\nin one of my videos but here we go: They have this one robotic baby. It’s weird guys. I have two very emotional scenes where I’m\ntalking to a newborn in the hospital and I go to put my hand on the robotic baby and it’s like vibrating and like making\nthese weird movements. Babies on screen aren’t going away anytime\nsoon. So until producers find a cheap and easy CGI\nfix for the baby dilemma, it looks like they’ll continue to have to\nwork within the regulations that are set up. Or they'll use demonic robot infants who will\ntake over humanity."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "In California, babies can only be on set for:", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "2 consecutive hours per day"}, {"label": "B", "text": "5 consecutive hours per day,"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Only once a week"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All day"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}
{"page": 25, "lesson": 13, "title": "5 life hacks based on science", "category": "Thinking & Learning", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/t35T0uu1", "transcript": {"en": "[UPBEAT MUSIC]  I know. I am doing a life hacks video. I know they're ridiculous,\nbut I swear to you, I've been using these\ntricks in my life. And I really actually want\nto share them with you. And I swear I will\nnot teach you things like you can cook a hot\ndog by hooking it up to either side of\na 9 volt battery. I just used this trick\nat a farmer's market. There was a company\nselling sunglasses claiming that they were\ncertified polarized. To check whether sunglasses\nare actually polarized, put them in front of the phone\nscreen and turn the glasses. If they're polarized,\nyou're going to see a change in the\nlight, either the color or the brightness. The light from\nmost phone screens is polarized, meaning the\nlight waves are aligned along a specific direction. Polarized sunglasses\nlet through light that is polarized in one direction. It's the same thing that\nthese polarizing filters do, but most people don't\nkeep polarizing filters in their purse. I do. So caveat to this trick. Screen protectors tend to make\nthe light from your phone more randomly polarized. So this trick may\nwork differently if you have a screen protector. But you can still\nlook at a reflection from glass or water\nor a car window, because on some surfaces\nat the right angle, you'll see changes\nin the reflection as you turn the\npolarized glasses. Oh yeah, so at the\nfarmer's market, the glasses were not polarized. And I told them so,\nbecause in real life, I am like you guys\nare in my comments. They started explaining to\nme what polarization was and how it works. And eventually were removing\nglasses from their shelves. Whoops! When you're putting\naway your headphones, instead of wrapping them\nin a loop, make a figure eight around your fingers. After a day of carrying\naround your stuff, they're going to end\nup much less tangled. This is the one I\nwas so excited about, because I've been\ndoing it for weeks and I can't believe\nhow it works. But it does. Why? Because your headphones\nare like a flat ribbon. By wrapping them\nin a circle, you introduce a bunch of twists. So when you straighten\nthem, the twists stay there. That doesn't happen\nwith a figure eight. Physicists have actually studied\nwhy headphones get so tangled and it has to do with the\nends poking through the loops. That makes knots\nand then you end up with twisted tangles\nin your knots. So an added bonus\nof the figure eight is that though you get knots,\nyour knots aren't all twisted. And you're making smaller loops. Harder for the ends to find. Boom! When you first get\nin a hot car, you might want to just blast the AC. But you're still keeping\nthe hot air inside. So open those windows. And you may not have\nchecked this setting. Recycling the hot\nair is just fighting against thermodynamics. So take in the cooler\nair from outside first. Then, once it cools\ndown inside, recycle. The air gets hot inside a parked\ncar in the first place because of the greenhouse effect. High energy light\ncomes in the windows, gets absorbed by\nyour seats and stuff, and then some low energy\nlight is re-emitted but can't get back out the windows. So the inside gets hot. So let out the hot air first. To avoid getting\nshocked by your car while getting out of\nit on a cold, dry day, touch the outside of the\ndoor frame as you get out. That allows the\nstatic charge caused by sliding across the seat\nto flow into the metal frame through your hand. So it never has a chance\nto build up and shock you. It even works if\nyou're riding shotgun. Sorry. That one was a stretch. To remove the residue from an\nold sticker, put some oil on it and rub it off. Or WD-40. I had no idea why this works. It's chemistry. So here to help me\nexplain is Elaine from the channel Reactions. ELAINE: So why does oil\nremove sticker residue? Well, it all comes\ndown to the principle that like dissolves like. Water and things that\ndissolve in water-- like sugar and salt-- are polar. Oil and water don't\nmix, because oil is non-polar and water's polar. Adhesives that don't resolve\nwith water are non-polar. So putting the non-polar oil\nwith the non-polar adhesive mixes the two likes\ntogether and allows you to easily wipe it away. Acetone, or nail polish\nremover, can also works, since it's non-polar, too. However, nail polish remover\ntends to dry out your skin. But that's a whole other story\nfor a completely different day.  Thank you, Elaine. That was awesome. I didn't know that's\nwhy that trick worked. Check out Reactions. I'm going to put a link\nin the description. We made it to the end\nof the life hacks video!

The first was Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagari,\nwho orbited the Earth in the Vostok 1 spacecraft on April 12, 1961. Only weeks later, the US launched their first\nhuman into space, Alan Shepard, aboard the Freedom 7. It wouldn’t be until 2003 that China would\nlaunch its first man into space, when the Shenzhou 5 spacecraft successfully took astronaut\nYang Liwei on a 21-hour mission to space and back. With revitalized space programs and private\nsector space aspirations, developments over the next few years might just make space great\nagain. Today we’ll compare a veteran space program\nwith a relatively new kid on the block, in this episode of The Infographics Show, NASA\nvs. SpaceX. Don’t forget to subscribe and click the\nbell button so that you can be part of our Notification Squad. We’ll start with a brief history of each\nprogram. NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, was created in 1958 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics\nand Space Act. According to the act, NASA’s space exploration\nwould forever be “devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all mankind.” It wasn’t until July 20, 1969, that NASA\nwould iconize space travel when it launched the Apollo 11 into space and made the first\nsuccessful moon landing. SpaceX, created by multitalented tech entrepreneur\nElon Musk, was founded on May 6, 2002. Musk’s mission is to eventually colonize\nMars, having stated on numerous occasions that human extinction on planet Earth is inevitable. SpaceX is, of course, a ways away from achieving\nthis goal, and while it hasn’t yet launched flesh and blood into space, it intends to\ndo so in the second quarter of next year. Musk has also said that by 2024, SpaceX will\nhave completed a manned mission to Mars. Moreover, he has boldly proclaimed that in\n50 years’ time, his company’s Interplanetary Transport System will be delivering up to\na million people to the Mars Colony. Musk may seem overly ambitious compared to\nNASA, whose website states that it won’t be until the 2030s until its sending people\nto the Red Planet. Does this mean NASA and SpaceX are competitors? In some ways yes, as NASA is a government\nagency and SpaceX is a private entity. The media has referred to this competition\nas the first public-private space race. The phrase was dubbed, however, not because\nof Mars ambitions, but after SpaceX announced in 2017 it will be taking people around the\nmoon in 2018. The main difference being that they would\nnot only be trained astronauts but extremely wealthy space tourists. NASA had before this announcement made it\nknown that it too would take tourists around the moon, but not until 2019. The question we now must ask is, who has the\nmost funding and who owns the more advanced technology to make space tourism happen? In terms of the balance sheet, SpaceX raised\nover $1 billion in funding in 2015 with 11 investors taking part. Elon Musk himself is worth over 17 billion\ndollars. The tech maverick has his hand in many pots,\nincluding his venture into the self-driving car market with his Tesla Motors company. How does SpaceX actually make money while\npiling it into developments and the millions it costs to launch? The answer is sending commercial satellites\ninto space, with investor analysis media Motley Fool claiming SpaceX charges around $62 million\nper launch. SpaceX charges the government around $20 million\ndollars every time it sends supplies to the International Space Station or launches satellites\nfor the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. As of June 2017, SpaceX had launched rockets\ninto space 41 times, with this year looking to be a record for the number of space flights. According to SpaceX president, Gwynne Shotwell,\nthe company will launch every two to three weeks in 2017. According to Motley Fool, the total revenue\nfor SpaceX is around $1.3 billion with $195 million in annual profits. Over the years, NASA has suffered from underfunding,\nwhich is one of the reasons why progress regarding the exploration of space has been ponderous\nsince the moon landing. In 2016, President Barack Obama bolstered\nNASA’s ambitions with an increased budget of around half a billion dollars, bringing\nthe total budget to around 19 billion dollars. This was good news for NASA, spurring its\nadministrator, Charlie Bolden, to announce publicly, “NASA is firmly on a journey to\nMars. Make no mistake, this journey will help guide\nand define our generation.\" We should note here that while there may be\na race to space between the private and the public in SpaceX and NASA, the former and\nother public companies are working with NASA to make the Mars dream come true. NASA has had plenty of setbacks besides underfunding. This includes the loss of two of its space\nshuttles in 1986 and 2003. Fourteen astronauts were killed in total,\nwhich didn’t help NASA’s ambitions. NASA has launched well over 100 crewed missions\nto space and over one thousand unmanned missions. NASA’s last manned space shuttle launch\nwas with its Space Transportation System in 2011. If you are wondering how astronauts or cosmonauts\nthese days get to the International Space Station and back down to Earth, they travel\non the Soyuz Russian spacecraft. Currently NASA is not sending humans into\nspace, although running the space station and most space-related activities are a collaboration\nbetween NASA, Russia, and other countries. NASA had originally said it would again be\nsending humans into space in 2021 aboard the Orion spacecraft, but that date has reportedly\nbeen moved forward to 2019. Perhaps NASA’s greatest recent success was\nthe 2011 launch of its planetary rover and the current work it does on Mars. Named the Curiosity, the rover is five times\nlarger than previous rovers that were sent to explore the Red Planet. You might also be asking yourself, what is\nthe difference between an astronaut and a cosmonaut? The answer is not much; astronauts are trained\nand certified through NASA and other countries’ space programs, while cosmonauts are trained\nsolely through Russia’s space program. Let’s now take a look at recent developments\nand an inventory of rocket stock. SpaceX’s grandest creation so far is its\nFalcon Heavy large payload rocket which is scheduled to launch within the next month\nor two. The rocket is designed to carry people, and\nit’s with this rocket that SpaceX sees the future. SpaceX also has a free-flying spacecraft called\nDragon, which was the first commercial spacecraft ever launched by a private company. It currently only carries cargo, but SpaceX\nbelieves it will be ready for human space travel by as early as 2018. The Dragon can be carried on the Falcon heavy\nrocket, or on SpaceX’s other rocket, the Falcon 9. The history of NASA’s space missions is\na long and fascinating story, and it is the reason for much of our understanding of space. For instance, NASA’s space probe, Voyager,\nreached the outer planets of Jupiter and Saturn, and 39 years later it’s still out there\nnavigating interstellar space. Voyager 2 was launched soon after and was\nthe first spacecraft to rub shoulders with Uranus and Neptune. NASA currently has a space probe, Juno, orbiting\nJupiter, while another record was broken in 2015 when NASA’s New Horizons space probe\ndid a fly-by of the Pluto system. Travelling at over 36,000 miles per hour,\nit made history when it came within 6,000 miles of Pluto. The journey was an astounding 3 billion miles. NASA’s current biggest development is the\nOrion launch, which will take four astronauts beyond the moon, according to NASA. Other main developments are related to research\naboard the International Space Station, global aviation, and emerging technologies such as\nrobotics. NASA has achieved truly incredible things,\nbut will the organization have to move over for Elon Musk’s amazing spacecraft technologies? In 2017, rumors surfaced that Donald Trump’s\nadministration wants to return to the moon, but will it be with a NASA or SpaceX vehicle? Some critics believe America is big enough\nfor two space programs, public and private, and there’s enough room on the moon for\ntwo future landings. Others have suggested NASA should keep its\nfocus on exploring deep space, while manned space travel and the possibility of a human\ncolony on Mars should be handled by other agencies. How do you think these two programs should\nmove into the future? Should NASA and SpaceX share the same space,\nor should each know its own place? Let us know in the comments!

In just over a billion years, the sun will\nhave expanded so much that the heat will begin to melt the earth's surface. So, is there any way us Earthlings can avoid\nthis detrimental event? Can we save ourselves from the suns ultimate\ndeath? Sure, none of us will be here, assuming we\ndon't find the secret to everlasting life. But, at the billion year mark, the sun will\nhave used up the hydrogen fuel in its core, forcing it to burn at its surface. The increased radiation will boil away all\nof the water on Earth creating an international desert. Flash forward about 5 billion years, and the\nswelling sun will begin literally melting mountains, with most, if not all life on earth\nnow extinct. Around 7.5 billion years, the expanding sun\n- now a Red Giant - will engulf the Earth entirely. Sounds bleak -- so can we avoid this hot mess? It turns out; our best bet lies in something\ncalled \"Gravity Assist\". A technique we've been using for years, only\nto launch space crafts throughout our solar system. Anytime a spacecraft or satellite comes in\nclose proximity to a planet, gravity grabs hold. And if the spacecraft arrives at the perfect\nangle, it's able to use some of the planets velocity to catapult it further into space. This 'extra' energy comes from the planet's\nown energy of motion around the sun. But, as Newton famously said \"To every action,\nthere is an equal and opposite reaction\". As the spacecraft uses the Earths gravity\nto speed up and move towards Earth, the planet will ever so slightly slow down and move towards\nthe spacecraft. Of course, the spacecraft's mass is so small,\ncomparatively, that it gets launched incredibly far, while the planet experiences little change. But, if we were to increase the spacecraft's\nsize -- or use an asteroid -- we could potentially move the Earth's orbit away from the sun. This would take millions of years, and involve\nlarge objects coming just close enough to not collide with Earth, but hey, we've got\na billion year head start! It may seem far-fetched, but it's already\nhappening! On October 9th, 2013, Earth will be used to\ngravity assist a spacecraft called Juno, which is on its way to Jupiter. As Juno flies within 559 kilometers of us,\nit will use Earth's gravity as a slingshot to boost its velocity by 7.3 km/s; Meanwhile,\nEarth will have been moved by a fraction. Juno will later arrive at Jupiter, in 2016,\nwhere it will study the interior of the planet and help to unveil many new spectacular mysteries\nof our Solar System. In order to move the Earth within our billion\nyear timeline, we would need approximately 1 encounter every 6,000 years, using an object\nwith a mass of approximately 10^19kg. That's 19 zeros - somewhere around the size\nof a 100 km-wide asteroid. In between passes, the asteroid would slingshot\naround the sun, fly out to Jupiter, and then be gravity assisted back to Earth - like one\nlong version of catch between planets. Over millions of years, this would move Earth\nto a comfortable 225 million kilometer orbit out from the sun. And while it is feasible, even with today's\ntechnology, it doesn't come without risks. For one, we may lose the moon, which could\nultimately create some extreme weather patterns. Not to mention, the Earth's spin may increase,\nmaking days only hours long. The surrounding planets, like our new neighbor\nMars, would likely have their own orbits destabilized. And...you know...the asteroid could come plummeting\ninto Earth by accident. But, perhaps these are the risks we need to\ntake to give our descendants, the planet and all life on it a few extra billion years. Got a burning question you want answered?

Tarvin", "category": "Science & Technology", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/why-don-t-poisonous-animals-poison-themselves-rebecca-d-tarvin", "transcript": {"en": "One fine day, when Charles Darwin was still \na student at Cambridge, the budding naturalist tore some\nold bark off a tree and found two rare beetles underneath. He’d just taken one beetle in each hand\nwhen he spotted a third beetle. Stashing one of the insects \nin his mouth for safekeeping, he reached for the new specimen – when a sudden spray of hot, \nbitter fluid scalded his tongue. Darwin’s assailant \nwas the bombardier beetle. It’s one of thousands of animal species, like frogs, jellyfish, salamanders, and snakes, that use toxic chemicals \nto defend themselves – in this case, by spewing poisonous liquid \nfrom glands in its abdomen. But why doesn’t this caustic substance,\nejected at 100 degrees Celsius, hurt the beetle itself? In fact, how do any toxic animals \nsurvive their own secretions? The answer is that they use one \nof two basic strategies: securely storing these compounds or evolving resistance to them. Bombardier beetles use the first approach. They store ingredients for their poison \nin two separate chambers. When they’re threatened, the valve \nbetween the chambers opens and the substances combine \nin a violent chemical reaction that sends a corrosive spray \nshooting out of the glands, passing through a hardened chamber that\nprotects the beetle’s internal tissues. Similarly, jellyfish package \ntheir venom safely in harpoon-like structures \ncalled nematocysts. And venomous snakes store their\nflesh-eating, blood-clotting compounds in specialized compartments\nthat only have one exit: through the fangs \nand into their prey or predator. Snakes also employ the second strategy:\nbuilt-in biochemical resistance. Rattlesnakes and other types of vipers\nmanufacture special proteins that bind and inactivate venom \ncomponents in the blood. Meanwhile, poison dart frogs have also\nevolved resistance to their own toxins, but through a different mechanism. These tiny animals defend themselves \nusing hundreds of bitter-tasting compounds called alkaloids that they accumulate from consuming \nsmall arthropods like mites and ants. One of their most potent alkaloids \nis the chemical epibatidine, which binds to the same receptors \nin the brain as nicotine but is at least ten times stronger. An amount barely heavier than \na grain of sugar would kill you. So what prevents poison frogs \nfrom poisoning themselves? Think of the molecular target \nof a neurotoxic alkaloid as a lock, and the alkaloid itself as the key. When the toxic key slides into the lock, it sets off a cascade of chemical \nand electrical signals that can cause paralysis, unconsciousness, and eventually death. But if you change the shape of the lock,\nthe key can’t fit. For poison dart frogs and many other\nanimals with neurotoxic defenses, a few genetic changes alter\nthe structure of the alkaloid-binding site just enough to keep the neurotoxin \nfrom exerting its adverse effects. Poisonous and venomous animals aren’t the only ones that can develop \nthis resistance: their predators and prey can, too. The garter snake, which dines \non neurotoxic salamanders, has evolved resistance \nto salamander toxins through some of the same genetic changes \nas the salamanders themselves. That means that only the most toxic \nsalamanders can avoid being eaten— and only the most resistant snakes\nwill survive the meal. The result is that the genes providing \nthe highest resistance and toxicity will be passed on in greatest quantities \nto the next generations. As toxicity ramps up, resistance does too, in an evolutionary arms race \nthat plays out over millions of years. This pattern appears over and over again. Grasshopper mice resist painful \nvenom from scorpion prey through genetic changes \nin their nervous systems. Horned lizards readily \nconsume harvester ants, resisting their envenomed sting \nwith specialized blood plasma. And sea slugs eat jellyfish nematocysts, prevent their activation \nwith compounds in their mucus, and repurpose them for their own defenses. The bombardier beetle is no exception: the toads that swallow them can tolerate the caustic spray \nthat Darwin found so distasteful. Most of the beetles \nare spit up hours later, amazingly alive and well. But how do the toads \nsurvive the experience? That is still a mystery."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "How do poisonous frogs resist their own poisons?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They have specialized blood plasma"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They store precursors of their poisons in separate glands"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They have genetic changes that disrupt toxin binding"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They have special proteins that bind to poisons and keep them inactive"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "How do poisonous animals avoid poisoning themselves?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "By securely storing their poisons"}, {"label": "B", "text": "By evolving resistance to their poisons"}, {"label": "C", "text": "By eating their own poisons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "By securely storing their poisons or by evolving resistance to their poisons"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "What animal eats highly toxic newts?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Snakes"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Highly resistant snakes"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Bombardier beetles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Humans"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "What is not a characteristic of the bombardier beetle's defense?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "When poison is emitted, the beetle dies"}, {"label": "B", "text": "The poison is corrosive"}, {"label": "C", "text": "The poison leaves the beetle's body at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius"}, {"label": "D", "text": "The poison's ingredients are stored separately in the beetle's glands"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Nematocysts are tiny, poisonous, harpoon-like structures found in ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Jellyfish"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Bombardier beetles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Poison frogs"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Lizards"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "How do poisonous frogs resist their own poisons?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "They have specialized blood plasma"}, {"label": "B", "text": "They store precursors of their poisons in separate glands"}, {"label": "C", "text": "They have genetic changes that disrupt toxin binding"}, {"label": "D", "text": "They have special proteins that bind to poisons and keep them inactive"}], "correct_option": "C"}]}

First, we must completely cover a square\ncanvas with non-overlapping rectangles. All must be unique, so if we use a 1x4, \nwe can’t use a 4x1 in another spot, but a 2x2 rectangle would be fine. Let’s try that. Say we have a canvas measuring 4x4. We can’t chop it directly in half, since that would give us \nidentical rectangles of 2x4. But the next closest option \n- 3x4 and 1x4 - works. That was easy, but we’re not done yet. Now take the area \nof the largest rectangle, and subtract the area of the smallest. The result is our score, and the goal is to get \nas low a score as possible. Here, the largest area is 12 \nand the smallest is 4, giving us a score of 8. Since we didn’t try to go \nfor a low score that time, we can probably do better. Let’s keep our 1x4 while breaking the 3x4 \ninto a 3x3 and a 3x1. Now our score is 9 minus 3, or 6. Still not optimal, but better. With such a small canvas, \nthere are only a few options. But let’s see what happens\nwhen the canvas gets bigger. Try out an 8x8; \nwhat’s the lowest score you can get? Pause here if you want \nto figure it out yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 To get our bearings, \nwe can start as before: dividing the canvas roughly in two. That gives us a 5x8 rectangle \nwith area 40 and a 3x8 with area 24, for a score of 16. That’s pretty bad. Dividing that 5x8 into a 5x5 \nand a 5x3 leaves us with a score of 10. Better, but still not great. We could just keep dividing \nthe biggest rectangle. But that would leave us \nwith increasingly tiny rectangles, which would increase the range \nbetween the largest and smallest. What we really want is for all our rectangles to fall\nwithin a small range of area values. And since the total area \nof the canvas is 64, the areas need to add up to that. Let’s make a list \nof possible rectangles and areas. To improve on our previous score, we can try to pick a range \nof values spanning 9 or less and adding up to 64. You’ll notice that some values \nare left out because rectangles like 1x13 \nor 2x9 won’t fit on the canvas. You might also realize that if you use one of the rectangles \nwith an odd area like 5, 9, or 15, you need to use another odd-value \nrectangle to get an even sum. With all that in mind, \nlet’s see what works. Starting with area 20 or more \nputs us over the limit too quickly. But we can get to 64 using\nrectangles in the 14-18 range, leaving out 15. Unfortunately, there’s no way \nto make them fit. Using the 2x7 leaves a gap that can only be filled \nby a rectangle with a width of 1. Going lower, the next range\nthat works is 8 to 14, leaving out the 3x3 square. This time, the pieces fit. That’s a score of 6. Can we do even better? No. We can get the same score \nby throwing out the 2x7 and 1x8 and replacing them \nwith a 3x3, 1x7, and 1x6. But if we go any lower down the list, the numbers become so small that we’d need a wider range \nof sizes to cover the canvas, which would increase the score. There’s no trick or formula here \n– just a bit of intuition. It's more art than science. And for larger grids, expert mathematicians aren’t sure whether\nthey’ve found the lowest possible scores.

It’s kind of like the Benedict Cumberbatch\nof taco toppings. Today we’re taking a look at why such a\npoor, innocent leaf can stoke such vitriol from the cilantro-phobes among us. This is Coriandrum sativum, an herb whose\nleaves we’ve come to know as cilantro, and whose seeds are used as spice commonly called\ncoriander. Its love of warm weather lets it grow all\nover the world, with the largest exporter being Mexico. So it’s no wonder you’re going to find\nit in these. This little plant also comes from the same\nfamily of aromatics as celery and parsley. But unlike parsley, which is probably one\nof the most inoffensive plants out there, cilantro bares the burden of being one of\nthe most divisive herb known to humankind. Lots of people love its aromatic quality,\nwhile others are totally repulsed by it. Every person has a different taste in food,\nbut this cilantroversy is so distinct in the population that it has led scientists to ask\nwhether there is an actual physical difference in cilantro haters. It’s been estimated that 4-14% of the population\ncan’t stand the taste of cilantro, but here’s where it gets interesting. Among that group of haters is a subgroup who\nliterally can’t help but hate it - they may have a genetic mutation that makes it\nso. These folks describe the taste of cilantro\nas soapy or dirt-like, terms that have a bit to do with the kind of smell you get from\nraw fats, bugs, or cosmetics. And For the rest of us taco lovers, I know\nthis can seem like a huge disgrace, but I’m here to tell you today not to blame your cilantro\nhating friend for their poor taste - these are matters that might rest far out their\nhands of control. These haters may be coping with a small change\nin their DNA called a single-nucleotide polymorphism or SNP for short. Cilantro haters tend to have a different version\nof a SNP in an area of chromosome 11 directly related to your sense of smell. This region contains the genes for several\nodor detectors, and the culprit is thought to be OR6A2. The rodent version of this gene is known to\nbind to a cilantro-abundant group of molecules called aldehydes, and common mutations in\nthe gene may change the way OR6A2 detects certain molecules in the aldehyde group, giving\npeople with these genetic changes an altogether different cilantro-sperience than the rest\nof us. Aldehydes are cilantro’s primary odor-causing\ncompounds. Two compounds in this group, decanal and dodecanal\noffer an earthy, sweet, green aroma. But the center of the cilantroversy is found\nwith the (E)-2-Alkenals, which give it that characteristically “soapy” taste. That SNP mutation mentioned earlier MAY cause\ncilantro haters to experience these (E)-2-Alkenals differently than the rest of us, ultimately\nmaking them the dominant flavor of the plant. But at this point, scientists haven’t discovered\nthe exact mechanism behind this soapy phenomenon. So when people out there say they hate cilantro,\nnow you know that it might not actually be their fault. They may be genetically programmed to taste\nthe stuff of soaps!

{"page": 25, "lesson": 19, "title": "What do food expiration dates actually mean?", "category": "Life Sciences", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/M1t7NQ4F", "transcript": {"en": "[♪ INTRO] You know that horrible, sour smell that comes\nfrom expired milk? Yeah. You only need to smell it once to make sure\nit never happens again. Luckily, many food manufacturers put some\nkind of Sell By, Best By, or Use By date on their products to tell you... well, actually, they don’t tell you much. These labels are mainly for quality and flavor\npurposes, not safety. And a lot of common foods are edible past\nwhat it says on the label. This can make it difficult to figure out what\nyou can eat and what needs to go in the compost bin. But understanding what’s happening chemically\nwhen foods go bad, both before and after those dates pass, can help you out. A product’s real expiration date is tricky\nto predict, because it can be affected by everything from the sanitation of the factory\nto the temperature of your fridge. But a lot of it depends on what kind of food\nyou’re buying. Produce, for instance, can become unsafe anywhere\nfrom hours to weeks after you buy it; a huge variation most labels don’t account for. Most of this has to do with when it gets moldy,\nand not about things like brown spots. Although those don’t look pretty, they’re\nharmless. Mold, meanwhile, can actually hurt you. Some strains produce substances called mycotoxins,\nwhich can cause everything from skin infections to internal bleeding and death. And because produce is such a water- and nutrient-rich\nhome for mold, it can start growing as soon as 24 hours after you bring your produce home. And it grows even faster in warm temperatures,\nlike on your sunny kitchen countertop. Extending the shelf life of your produce is\npretty easy, though: Just throw it in the fridge. Chemical reactions happen more slowly at cold\ntemperatures, so it takes longer for mold to grow and reproduce in there. But it will grow eventually. And when it does, whether it’s after a day\nor a few weeks, it’s time for the compost bin. Dropping the temperature might be a great\ntrick for a lot of food preservation, but if you want to really push back the expiration\ndate, you have to kill bacteria before letting them reproduce. That’s not easy with produce, but it’s\nexactly how we treat milk. According to the label, milk is usually at\nits best for around two weeks after you buy it. But depending on the kind you buy and how\nyou treat it, it could really expire a few days later, or earlier. Traditional milk goes through the process\nof pasteurization, a heat treatment process that denatures enzymes in living bacteria\nand renders them harmless. And it does a good job, but it’s not perfect. Some of those bacteria survive pasteurization,\nand over time, they convert the sugars in milk into lactic acid. That’s what gives spoiled milk that sour\nsmell. Normally, this process takes a couple of weeks\nand, typically, it’s still drinkable for around five days after the Sell-By date. But if the milk gets exposed to slightly warmer\ntemperatures somewhere along the shipping route, or if you run your refrigerator a few\ndegrees warmer, it can spoil faster. And while you’re probably not going to catch\nanything life threatening from drinking spoiled milk, you can catch some brutal food poisoning. The good news is, it’s easy to tell if milk’s\ngone bad. Just give it a whiff, and take in that lovely\nlactic acid smell. Finally, while heat treatments are awesome\nfor getting rid of bacteria in milk, you’ll need a different strategy for meat. Typically, the Best or Use By dates on these\nproducts is for a week or so past purchase. But while it’s often safe past then, it\ndoesn’t last for that much longer. That’s because meat is a prime breeding\nground for bacteria. It’s a wet, nutrient-dense home with all\nkinds of fuel sources. For a few days, these bacteria won’t cause\nyou any trouble because there aren’t that many of them. But over time, they’ll multiply. And that’s when you get problems. Bacteria, like Psuedomonas or Lactobacilli,\nfeast on the meat’s surface, where there are free floating sugar molecules and light\nweight compounds to nom on. Some of these bacteria can make you sick,\nbut they do at least announce their presence. As they break those compounds down, they leave\nbehind some nasty smelling byproducts. These have all kinds of shapes and compositions,\nbut they all fall into a category called volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Normally, these VOCS smell like rotten meat. And because you find them when bacteria have\nbeen chowing down and multiplying, there’s a pretty strong sign your meat has gone bad. Besides the smell, you can also probably tell\nyour meat has expired based on how it looks. For example, VOCs like hydrogen sulfide can\nconvert the natural muscle pigment in meat into something that looks more green. Typically, all this happens a few days after\nthe Use By date on that sticker. But if you notice any of those funky smells\nor a little slime on your beef… it’s time for it to go, no matter when it happens. Food science can be tricky, and those ambiguous\nlabels don’t always help. Knowing a little bit about how and why food\nexpires can help you keep your fridge full for longer.

I've received hate online. A lot of it. And it comes\nwith the territory of my work. I'm a digital creator, I make things specifically\nfor the internet. Like, a few years ago, I made\na video series called \"Every Single Word\" where I edited down popular films to only the words\nspoken by people of color, as a way to empirically and accessibly\ntalk about the issue of representation in Hollywood. Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill started gaining media attention\naround the United States, I hosted and produced an interview series called \"Sitting in Bathrooms\nwith Trans People\" where I did exactly that. (Laughter) And then -- Sure, I'll take applause. (Applause) Thank you. And then, are you familiar\nwith those unboxing videos on YouTube where YouTubers open up\nthe latest electronic gadgets? Great, so I satirized those\nin a weekly series, where instead I unboxed\nintangible ideologies like police brutality, masculinity\nand the mistreatment of Native Americans. (Laughter) My work -- Thanks. One person applauding, God bless. (Laughter) Mom, hi. (Laughter) So, my work became popular. Very popular. I got millions of views,\na ton of great press and a slew of new followers. But the flip side of success\non the internet is internet hate. I was called everything. From \"beta\" to \"snowflake\"\nand, of course, the ever-popular \"cuck.\" Don't worry, I will break\nthese terms down for you. (Laughter) So, \"beta,\" for those of you unfamiliar, is shorthand online lingo for \"beta male.\" But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings and my fashion aesthetic\nis rich-white-woman-running-errands, so I'm not angling to be an alpha. (Applause) Doesn't totally work. (Laughter) Now, \"snowflake\" is a put-down\nfor people who are sensitive and believe themselves to be unique, and I'm a millennial\nand an only child, so, duh! (Laughter) But my favorite, favorite,\nfavorite is \"cuck.\" It's a slur, short for \"cuckold,\" for men who have been\ncheated on by their wives. But friends, I am so gay, that if I had a wife, I would\nencourage her to cheat on me. (Laughter) Thank you. Let's take a look at some\nof this negativity in action. Sometimes it's direct. Like Marcos, who wrote, \"You're everything I hate\nin a human being.\" Thank you, Marcos. Others are more concise. Like Donovan, who wrote,\n\"gaywad fagggggg.\" Now, I do need to point out,\nDonovan is not wrong, OK? In fact, he's right on both counts,\nso credit where credit is due. Thank you, Donovan. Others write to me with questions,\nlike Brian, who asked, \"Were you born a bitch or did you\njust learn to be one over time?\" But my favorite thing about this is that once Brian was done typing,\nhis finger must have slipped because then he sent me\nthe thumbs-up emoji. (Laughter) So, babe, thumbs up to you, too. (Laughter) It's fun to talk about these messages now. Right? And it's cathartic to laugh at them. But I can tell you that it really\ndoes not feel good to receive them. At first, I would screenshot\ntheir comments and make fun of their typos, but this soon felt elitist\nand ultimately unhelpful. So over time, I developed\nan unexpected coping mechanism. Because most of these messages I received\nwere through social media, I could often click on the profile picture\nof the person who sent them and learn everything about them. I could see pictures they were tagged in, posts they'd written, memes they'd shared, and somehow, seeing that it was\na human on the other side of the screen made me feel a little better. Not to justify what they wrote, right? But just to provide context. Still, that didn't feel like enough. So, I called some of them -- only the ones I felt safe talking to -- with a simple opening question: \"Why did you write that?\" The first person I spoke to was Josh. He had written to tell me\nthat I was a moron, I was a reason this country\nwas dividing itself, and he added at the end\nthat being gay was a sin. I was so nervous\nfor our first conversation. This wasn't a comments section. So I couldn't use tools\nlike muting or blocking. Of course, I guess,\nI could have hung up on him. But I didn't want to. Because I liked talking to him. Because I liked him. Here's a clip of one of our conversations. (Audio) Dylan Marron: Josh, you said you're about to graduate\nhigh school, right? Josh: Mmm-hmm. DM: How is high school for you? Josh: Am I allowed to use\nthe H-E-double-hockey-stick word? DM: Oh, yeah. You're allowed to. Josh: It was hell. DM: Really? Josh: And it's still hell right now,\neven though it's only two weeks left. I'm a little bit bigger --\nI don't like to use the word \"fat,\" but I am a little bit bigger\nthan a lot of my classmates and they seem to judge me\nbefore they even got to know me. DM: That's awful. I mean, I also just want\nto let you know, Josh, I was bullied in high school, too. So did our common ground\nof being bullied in high school erase what he wrote me? No. And did our single phone conversation radically heal a politically\ndivided country and cure systemic injustice? No, absolutely not, right? But did our conversation\nhumanize us to each other more than profile pictures\nand posts ever could? Absolutely. I didn't stop there. Because some of the hate I received\nwas from \"my side.\" So when Matthew,\na queer liberal artist like me publicly wrote that I represented\nsome of the worst aspects of liberalism, I wanted to ask him this. DM: You tagged me in this post. Did you want me to see it? Matthew (Laughing): I honestly\ndidn't think that you would. DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged? Matthew: I have been. And I just said, \"No, I don't care.\" DM: And did you not care? Matthew: But it was hard. DM: Did you not care? Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes. DM: At the end of these conversations, there's often a moment of reflection. A reconsideration. And that's exactly what happened at the end of my call\nwith a guy named Doug who had written that I was\na talentless propaganda hack. (Audio) Did the conversation\nwe just had -- does it, like, make you feel differently\nabout how you write online? Doug: Yeah! You know,\nwhen I said this to you, when I said you were a \"talentless hack,\" I had never conversed\nwith you in my life, really. I didn't really know anything\nreally about you. And I think that a lot of times, that's what the comment\nsections really are, it's really a way to get\nyour anger at the world out on random profiles\nof strangers, pretty much. DM (Laughing): Yeah, right. Doug: But it definitely\nhas made me rethink the way that I interact\nwith people online. DM: So I've collected these\nconversations and many others for my podcast \"Conversations\nwith People Who Hate Me.\" (Laughter) Before I started this project, I thought that the real way\nto bring about change was to shut down opposing viewpoints through epically worded\nvideo essays and comments and posts, but I soon learned\nthose were only cheered on by the people who already agreed with me. Sometimes -- bless you. Sometimes, the most subversive\nthing you could do -- yeah, clap for him. (Laughter) Sometimes, the most subversive\nthing you could do was to actually speak\nwith the people you disagreed with, and not simply at them. Now in every one of my calls, I always ask my guests\nto tell me about themselves. And it's their answer to this question\nthat allows me to empathize with them. And empathy, it turns out, is a key ingredient in getting\nthese conversations off the ground, but it can feel very vulnerable to be empathizing with someone\nyou profoundly disagree with. So I established\na helpful mantra for myself. Empathy is not endorsement. Empathizing with someone\nyou profoundly disagree with does not suddenly compromise\nyour own deeply held beliefs and endorse theirs. Empathizing with someone who, for example,\nbelieves that being gay is a sin doesn't mean that I'm suddenly\ngoing to drop everything, pack my bags and grab\nmy one-way ticket to hell, right? It just means that I'm acknowledging the humanity of someone who was raised\nto think very differently from me. I also want to be super clear\nabout something. This is not a prescription for activism. I understand that\nsome people don't feel safe talking to their detractors and others feel so marginalized that they justifiably don't feel\nthat they have any empathy to give. I totally get that. This is just what I feel\nwell-suited to do. You know, I've reached out\nto a lot of people for this podcast. And some have politely declined, others have read my message\nand ignored it, some have blocked me automatically\nwhen I sent the invitation and one guy actually agreed to do it and then, five minutes into the call, hung up on me. I'm also aware that this talk\nwill appear on the internet. And with the internet comes\ncomment sections, and with comment sections\ninevitably comes hate. So as you are watching this talk, you can feel free to call me\nwhatever you'd like. You can call me a \"gaywad,\"\na \"snowflake,\" a \"cuck,\" a \"beta,\" or \"everything wrong with liberalism.\" But just know that if you do,\nI may ask you to talk. And if you refuse\nor block me automatically or agree and hang up on me, then maybe, babe, the snowflake is you. Thank you so much. (Applause) (Cheering) (Applause)"}, "multiple-choice": []}
{"page": 25, "lesson": 21, "title": "How much of what you see is a hallucination? - Elizabeth Cox", "category": "Health", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-causes-hallucinations-elizabeth-cox", "transcript": {"en": "An elderly woman named Rosalie \nwas sitting in her nursing home when her room suddenly burst \nto life with twirling fabrics. Through the elaborate drapings, she could make out animals, children, and costumed characters. Rosalie was alarmed,\nnot by the intrusion, but because she knew this entourage \nwas an extremely detailed hallucination. Her cognitive function was excellent, and she had not taken any medications \nthat might cause hallucinations. Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd \nof circus performers burst into her room, she wouldn’t have been able to see them: she was completely blind. Rosalie had developed a condition known \nas Charles Bonnet Syndrome, in which patients with either impaired \nvision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scenes \nin vivid color. These hallucinations appear suddenly, and can last for mere minutes \nor recur for years. We still don’t fully understand \nwhat causes them to come and go, or why certain patients develop them \nwhen others don’t. We do know from fMRI studies \nthat these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight, areas that are not activated \nby imagination. Many other hallucinations, \nincluding smells, sights, and sounds, also involve the same brain areas \nas real sensory experiences. Because of this, the cerebral cortex is\nthought to play a part in hallucinations. This thin layer of grey matter \ncovers the entire cerebrum, with different areas processing \ninformation from each of our senses. But even in people\nwith completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive\nfrom incomplete information. For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve \nblocks part of the retina. When the visual cortex processes light \ninto coherent images, it fills in these blind spots with \ninformation from the surrounding area. Occasionally, we might notice a glitch,\nbut most of the time we’re none the wiser. When the visual cortex is deprived \nof input from the eyes, even temporarily, the brain still tries \nto create a coherent picture, but the limits of its abilities \nbecome a lot more obvious. The full-blown hallucinations of\nCharles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome \nonly occurs in people who had normal vision \nand then lost their sight, not those who were born blind, scientists think the brain uses\nremembered images to compensate for \nthe lack of new visual input. And the same is true for other senses. People with hearing loss \noften hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony \nof an entire marching band. In addition to sensory deprivation, recreational and therapeutic drugs, conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy, and psychiatric disorders \nlike schizophrenia, are a few of the many known causes \nof hallucinations, and we’re still finding new ones. Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs \nlike LSD and psilocybin. Their hallmark effects include \nthe sensation that dry objects are wet and that surfaces are breathing. At higher doses, the visual world \ncan appear to melt, dissolve into swirls, or burst into fractal-like patterns. Evidence suggests these drugs also \nact on the cerebral cortex. But while visual impairment typically \nonly causes visual hallucinations, and hearing loss auditory ones, substances like LSD cause perceptual\ndisturbances across all the senses. That’s likely because they activate \nreceptors in a broad range of brain areas, including the cortical regions \nfor all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function \nlike serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of\nserotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain \nis complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part \nin integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin\ncause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling \ninvolved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated \nwith schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those\ncaused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels \nof serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve \nsymptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin \nreceptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve \nthe hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding \nall the different causes and interconnected mechanisms \nof hallucinations. But it’s clear that \nhallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary\nperception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct \nthe world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate\njust how subjective and individual each person’s island universe \nof perception really is."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The hallucinations associated with Charles Bonnet Syndrome can last for minutes or recur for _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Weeks"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Months"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Years"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Charles Bonnet Syndrome occurs in people who _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Had normal vision and then lost their sight"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Were born blind"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Are named Charles"}, {"label": "D", "text": "None of the above"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "A few of the many known causes of hallucinations include _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Epilepsy"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Narcolepsy"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Schizophrenia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "All of the above"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "LSD and psilocybin both function like _______ in the brain.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Oxytocin"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Endorphins"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Serotonin"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Dopamine"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Patients with schizophrenia often have _______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Elevated levels of dopamine in the brain"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Elevated levels of serotonin in the brain"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Elevated levels of oxytocin in the brain"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Elevated levels of endorphins in the brain"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
{"page": 25, "lesson": 22, "title": "What can we learn from insect cribs?", "category": "Environmental Science", "url": "https://ed.ted.com/best_of_web/FZgxOIFH", "transcript": {"en": "Honey bees are the ultimate social creatures and they've evolved to organize themselves in complex and interesting ways in order toprogress and optimize the productivity of their species In fact, they're what we call \"eusocial\" animals This is a term given to organisms that live in multi-generational groups, cooperatively take care of their young, have a caste system, and have a division of labor. In eusocial societies, the workers, soldiers, caretakers and reproducers are different not only in their behaviors but in their physiologies as well For instance, a worker bee can't reproduce at all. There can only be one reproducer: the queen bee, and her name is Beyonce. Eusociality has been observed in the order hymenoptera, which includes the bees, wasps and ants as well as in termites But that doesn't mean that every species within the order are eusocial. There are varying degrees of social groupings and a lot can be learned about their lifestyles by looking at the places they call home. So today, we bring you Insect Cribs. Fire ants. Fire ants are pretty crazy. They invaded the United States in the 1930s and spread like, well, wildfire. If they encounter a flood, they'll band together into a giant ball and float away. The queen of one of these colonies can live up to 7 years and give birth to a thousand eggs a day So, needless to say they're fairly difficult to get rid of and very resilient creatures. \"Wherever man is, there the ant is also.\" This is an upside down cast nest of a fire ant colony. It was created by pouring molton aluminum into the colony, which made  impressions of the various tunnels and chambers. The method was developed by ant scientist Walter Tschinkle, who wanted to know more about what the underground ant homes looked like. They're hard to draw and observe in 3 dimensions, so instead he had the idea to pour casting material into them What results is an intricately detailed impression of the colony, and reveals information about the colony's size and scope. Carpenter Ants Not all eusocial ants make nests in the ground There's nothing quite like living in what you think is a stable property, only to learn  that the walls of your home are essentially made out of swiss cheese. And if that's so, you can thank Carpenter Ants. Even though they're a total nuisance to the homeowners, they play an important ecological role by helping to speed up the decaying process in nature There are more than a thousand species and although they live in and bore through wood, they're not eating it. Carpenter ants are unable to digest plant cellulose Instead, they forage on dead insects They'll eat the internal fluids and juices, then decapitate their prey and bring the head back to the colony so the insect's brains can be fed to a choice family member. These ants also receive nutrition by milking aphids like a herd of little invertebrate cows. The aphids feed on plant sap, which is rich in sugars. Ants love sugars, so they use touch and chemical receptors to create herds of aphids and entice them to excrete those excess sugars out of their butts, on command. The ants eat the fluid, which scientists call honeydew, but lets be honest, it's sugar poop. Delicious. Stinging Ants Ants don't only live in dead trees. some living trees have made accommodations for them, too. Certain species of acai and vachellia trees and stinging ants have evolved to co-exist in a mutually beneficial way. These trees have hollow thorns, or in the case of the Whistling Thorn Vachellia, grow special bulbous thorn chambers that the ants can chew a hole into and that becomes their home. A single colony of ants will dominate a tree, and rush out to prevent herbivores from attacking the leaves. In return for the security, the tree provides the ants with food and nutrients But it's been observed by some scientists that the absence of giraffes and elephants, like when a border fence is placed around a tree, over a number of of years the tree produces fewer thorns and resources for the ants, who have nowhere else to go, and there exists a high competition for trees Let's just say it's a relationship that's a work in progress. Weaver Ants And when a plant doesn't directly adapt to the presence of its host ants, some species have constructed their own homes, and they're enlisting their kids to help out. Weaver ants live in trees and build their own nests out of it's leaves with silk. But the adults can't produce the silk themselves, so they pick up a larvae in their mandibles and use it like a glue stick, gently squeezing and moving back and forth to stitch the leaves together. The entire colony lives in these melon-sized nests- the queen and her entire hard working family. Paper Wasps Wasps have different social structures than most ants and bees, and there are many different kinds of social wasps. You're probably most familiar with yellow jackets, which are semi-social insects. In a semisocial structure, there can be a dominant queen, but all members can reproduce and she can be overthrown if she becomes week or replaced if she dies. These wasps  make delicate papery nests by mixing their saliva with wood fibers and then regurgitating the paste to build individual chambers for eggs. You can easily find these nests hanging from a tree, or probably your garage. and the colors of the nest can change depending on what sort of wood or paper is available. Given colored options, they'll make a rainbow nest. Gall Wasps Some wasp species don't live socially and therefore, don't need social structures. Gall wasps lay each of their eggs into individual plant and leaf stems. The wasp uses an ovipositer, which looks like a big hypodermic needle, to insert an egg into the stem of a plant. The plant responds by creating a large swollen growth around the egg, and then the egg hatches, and the larva develops and grows by feeding off of the plant material. Plant galls have been majorly important to human commerce for thousands of years, because they contain high concentrations of tannins. Some of the first permanent writing ink was created by combining iron salts and tannic acids from these insect galls. But they've also been used in dyes, lamp fuel, and medicines. Potter wasps Like gall wasps, potter wasps live solitarily. But since they take care of their young for a certain amount of time, they're considered sub-social animals. Instead of simply laying their eggs in a plant and moving on, The female potter wasp begins constructing vessels out of mud, and they resemble tiny little pots. As she's building up the home, she ventures out to collect snacks for her baby, but instead of killing the prey, which are usually small caterpillars, she paralyses them. That way they don't begin spoiling before the larvae can hatch and get around to chowing down. Then she lays her egg and seals up the container. Mud Daubers Similar to potter wasps, mud daubers create clay and mud containers to house their offspring But, they're also insects with unintentional destructive tendencies. Instead of making a single chamber at a time, some make long, narrow tubes with multiple chambers The female deposits a paralysed spider into each chamber, drops in an egg, and then seals them up. But if they find a preexisting tube, they'll use that instead, like in a case where a plastic pipe was left behind a shelf in a post office in Arkansas, and a mud dauber set up shop. But more seriously, mud daubers have been known to create nests in pilot tubes and outflow valves on airplanes. They've been responsible for at least 3 major airline crashes that killed more than 200 people since 1980. Termites And, to bring it back to the beginning, where queen honeybees are at the top of their reproductive game, Queen termites are essentially slaves to their colonies A queen and king termite will bury themselves underground and begin reproducing- and fast. A termite queen can lay an egg every 3 seconds for 15 years, resulting in a quarter of a billion babies in her lifetime. So some of these colonies can grow to be more than 30 feet high. Her body becomes so big and distended that she becomes imprisoned within her royal chamber, constantly being tended to by her offspring, who will eventually kill her by licking her to death, draining her body of all of its fats and fluids. It still has brains on it"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "Honey bees are eusocial.

But then an annoying whine\ninterrupts the peace, getting closer, and closer, and closer. Until...whack! You dispatch the offending mosquito, \nand calm is restored. How did you detect that noise from afar\nand target its maker with such precision? The ability to recognize sounds \nand identify their location is possible thanks to the auditory system. That’s comprised of two main parts: \nthe ear and the brain. The ear’s task is to convert sound energy\ninto neural signals; the brain’s is to receive and process \nthe information those signals contain. To understand how that works, we can follow a sound \non its journey into the ear. The source of a sound creates vibrations that travel as waves of pressure \nthrough particles in air, liquids, or solids. But our inner ear, called the cochlea, is actually filled \nwith saltwater-like fluids. So, the first problem to solve \nis how to convert those sound waves, wherever they’re coming from, into waves in the fluid. The solution is the eardrum, \nor tympanic membrane, and the tiny bones of the middle ear. Those convert the large movements \nof the eardrum into pressure waves \nin the fluid of the cochlea. When sound enters the ear canal, it hits the eardrum and makes it vibrate \nlike the head of a drum. The vibrating eardrum jerks a bone \ncalled the hammer, which hits the anvil and\nmoves the third bone called the stapes. Its motion pushes the fluid \nwithin the long chambers of the cochlea. Once there, the sound vibrations have finally\nbeen converted into vibrations of a fluid, and they travel like a wave \nfrom one end of the cochlea to the other. A surface called the basilar membrane \nruns the length of the cochlea. It’s lined with hair cells that have \nspecialized components called stereocilia, which move with the vibrations of the\ncochlear fluid and the basilar membrane. This movement triggers a signal \nthat travels through the hair cell, into the auditory nerve, then onward to the brain, \nwhich interprets it as a specific sound. When a sound makes \nthe basilar membrane vibrate, not every hair cell moves - only selected ones, \ndepending on the frequency of the sound. This comes down to some fine engineering. At one end, \nthe basilar membrane is stiff, vibrating only in response to short\nwavelength, high-frequency sounds. The other is more flexible, vibrating only in the presence of longer\nwavelength, low-frequency sounds. So, the noises made by the seagull \nand mosquito vibrate different locations \non the basilar membrane, like playing different keys on a piano. But that’s not all that’s going on. The brain still has another \nimportant task to fulfill: identifying where a sound is coming from. For that, it compares the sounds \ncoming into the two ears to locate the source in space. A sound from directly in front of you will\nreach both your ears at the same time. You’ll also hear it at the same intensity \nin each ear. However, a low-frequency sound \ncoming from one side will reach the near ear microseconds \nbefore the far one. And high-frequency sounds will sound\nmore intense to the near ear because they’re blocked \nfrom the far ear by your head. These strands of information \nreach special parts of the brainstem that analyze time and\nintensity differences between your ears. They send the results of their \nanalysis up to the auditory cortex. Now, the brain has \nall the information it needs: the patterns of activity \nthat tell us what the sound is, and information about \nwhere it is in space. Not everyone has normal hearing. Hearing loss is the third most common \nchronic disease in the world. Exposure to loud noises \nand some drugs can kill hair cells, preventing signals from traveling \nfrom the ear to the brain. Diseases like osteosclerosis freeze \nthe tiny bones in the ear so they no longer vibrate. And with tinnitus, the brain does strange things to make us think there’s a sound \nwhen there isn’t one. But when it does work, our hearing is an incredible, \nelegant system. Our ears enclose a fine-tuned piece \nof biological machinery that converts the cacophony of vibrations \nin the air around us into precisely tuned electrical impulses that distinguish claps, taps, \nsighs, and flies."}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "The motion of the ______ pushes the fluid in the cochlea.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Tympanic membrane (eardrum)"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Hammer"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Anvil"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Stapes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "The vibrations of the cochlear fluid move the ______ of the hair cells.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stereocilia"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Basilar membrane"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Synapse"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nucleus"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "Complex sounds vibrate different locations on the basilar membrane, which is like playing the ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Head of a drum"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Keys of a piano"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Hammer"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Anvil"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "If a sound is coming from your right side, then ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "It reaches both ears at the same time"}, {"label": "B", "text": "It is louder in the left ear"}, {"label": "C", "text": "It reaches the right ear first"}, {"label": "D", "text": "It is blocked by the head if it is at a low frequency"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which of these chronic diseases is the one of the most common conditions in the world?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Hearing loss related to age and/or other factors"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ischemic heart disease"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Chronic kidney disease"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Mental and substance use disorders"}], "correct_option": "A"}]}

Their exploits were\nrecounted by many epic poets. They fought in the legendary Trojan War \nand their grand army invaded Athens. Jason and the Argonauts \npassed by their shores, barely avoiding their deadly arrows. These formidable fighters faced off \nagainst the greatest champions of myth: Heracles, Theseus, and Achilles. And every single one \nof these warriors was a woman. The war-loving Amazons,\n\"the equals of men\" in courage and skill, were familiar to everyone in\nancient Greece. Amazon battle scenes decorated \nthe Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis; paintings and statues of Amazons\nadorned temples and public spaces. Little girls played with Amazon dolls, and Amazons were a favorite subject \non Greek vase paintings. In Greek art and literature, they were depicted as daring \nand desirable, but also terrifying and deadly, and doomed to die \nat the hands of Greek heroes. Were Amazons merely figures of myth,\nor something more? It was long assumed \nthat they were imaginary, like the cyclops and centaurs. But curiously enough, \nstories from ancient Egypt, Persia, the Middle East, Central Asia, India, and China also featured Amazon-like warrior women. And Amazons were described in ancient\nhistorical accounts, not just myths. Writers like Herodotus, Plato, \nand Strabo never doubted their existence. So who were the real women \nwarriors known as Amazons? Ancient historians located \nthe Amazon homeland in Scythia, the vast territory stretching from the Black Sea across \nthe steppes of Central Asia. This immense region was populated \nby nomadic tribes whose lives centered on horses, archery, and warfare. Their culture flourished for about\n1,000 years beginning around 800 BC. Feared by Greeks, Persians, and\nthe Chinese, the Scythians left no written records.\nBut we can find clues in how their neighbors described them,\nas well as in archaeology. Scythians' ancestors were \nthe first to ride horses and they invented the recurve bow. And, because a female mounted archer \ncould be as fast and as deadly as a male, all children were trained \nto ride and shoot. Women hunted and fought alongside men,\nusing the same weapons. The harsh landscape \nand their nomadic lifestyle created its own form of equality. This amazed the ancient Greeks, \nwhose women led restricted indoor lives. The earliest stories of the Scythians, \nand Amazons, may have been exaggerated rumors. But as the Greeks began to trade around \nthe Black Sea and further east, their portrayals became more realistic. Early depictions of Amazons showed them \nwith Greek weapons and armor. But in later representations, they wielded bows and battle-axes, rode horses, and wore pointed caps \nand patterned trousers characteristic of steppe nomads. Until recently, no one was sure \nhow strong the links were between Scythians \nand the Amazons of Greek myth. But recent archaeological discoveries \nhave provided ample evidence. More than 1,000 ancient Scythian kurgans,\nor burial mounds, have been excavated, containing skeletons and weapons. Archaeologists had previously assumed that weapons could only \nbelong to male warriors. But modern DNA analysis so far has revealed that about 300 skeletons \nburied with weapons belong to females ranging\nin age from 10 to 45, and more are being found every year. The women's skeletons \nshow battle injuries: ribs slashed by swords, skulls bashed by battle-axes, and arrows embedded in bones. In classical art and writings, the fearsome Amazons were always portrayed\nas brave and heroic. In male-dominated classical Greece, \nhowever, the very idea of strong women who gloried \nin freedom and war aroused mixed feelings. And yet, the Greeks were also drawn\nto egalitarian ideals. Is it possible that the mythic realm \nof thrilling Amazon tales was a way to imagine women\nand men as equal companions?"}, "multiple-choice": [{"question": "\"Amazon\" means ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "\"Female soldier\" in ancient Etruscan"}, {"label": "B", "text": "\"Warrior\" in ancient Iranian"}, {"label": "C", "text": "\"Without Breast\" in ancient Greek"}, {"label": "D", "text": "\"Nomad\" in Latin"}], "correct_option": "B"}, {"question": "Ancient Greek historians located Amazons in Scythia, a vast territory ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Stretching west from the Black Sea to the Alps"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Reaching from the Alps of Italy to the North Sea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Stretching east from the Black Sea to Central Asia"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Extending across North Africa from Morocco to Egypt"}], "correct_option": "C"}, {"question": "Which ancient Greek hero of myth did not fight the Amazons?", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Odysseus"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Achilles"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Theseus"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Heracles"}], "correct_option": "A"}, {"question": "The Amazons of Greek myth were influenced by the real women of ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "Imperial Rome"}, {"label": "B", "text": "Ancient Judea"}, {"label": "C", "text": "Ancient Japan"}, {"label": "D", "text": "Nomad tribes"}], "correct_option": "D"}, {"question": "Archaeological evidence from ancient Scythian burials confirms ______.", "options": [{"label": "A", "text": "That Amazons removed one breast in order to draw bows"}, {"label": "B", "text": "That some nomad women were active warriors using the same weapons as the men"}, {"label": "C", "text": "That only Scythian men and boys owned weapons"}, {"label": "D", "text": "That Scythian nomads dressed like Greek warriors"}], "correct_option": "B"}]}
